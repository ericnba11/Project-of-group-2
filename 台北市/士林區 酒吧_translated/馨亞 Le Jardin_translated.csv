"氣氛跟餐點非常適合約會！餐點很好吃，前菜的火腿+無花果好搭，搭配在一起留在嘴裡的香氣好舒服，湯品洋蔥湯略微普通，很濃郁偏鹹，半碗後就膩了

主菜點了招牌的油封鴨腿，醬汁配菜都好搭，在配上松露馬鈴薯泥一絕，鴨腿很細嫩，一絲一絲的肉質與脆皮一起入口真的挺享受","The atmosphere and meals are very suitable for dating!The meal is delicious. The ham of the former vegetables+the fruits of the fruits is good. The aroma that stays in the mouth is so comfortable.

"開年之始終於讓我訂到鑫亞，住天母時總經過，卻從來沒機會走上台階，每次都是full house! 元旦吃到他真是好運☘️☘️☘️

剛吃了一塊baguette就上了豬肉terrine ，搭配蘋果醬和pickle挺爽口的，想起wooloomooloo吃的肉派搭配醃紫色高麗菜，多了酥皮不比這裡的terrine遜色。

蛙腿淋上basil醬與微辣紅椒粉，口感和雞腿一模模一樣樣，沒有奇怪的雜味，非常開胃。洋蔥湯我很喜歡，麵包不會太大塊，高湯⋯和我買過的進口牛肉高湯塊有點像，我是食品業養成的速食味蕾？

點菜時在眾多主菜選擇中迷失，最後選了酥皮乳鴿，威靈頓牛排的乳鴿版本。我很少吃乳鴿，大部分法式餐廳為求嫩口做的很生，帶著濃濃血腥味；不然就是留著一根爪子，茹毛飲血的心情不是很好。今天的酥皮厚薄恰到好處，帶著迷人的奶油香氣，乳鴿胸不滲血絲，鴿腿也很鮮嫩，蘸上橙花蜜太完美了，是今晚最喜歡的一道菜。餐酒搭配隆河的紅酒，莓果香氣濃厚，和餐點相得益彰。但到最後真的一點都吃不下了，留下一條鴿腿，對主廚真是抱歉🫡

葡萄酒選擇不少，很少遇到rose可以點單杯，還有三種選擇呢！可以點單杯也可以點半瓶(約4杯)，我太喜歡了！

氛圍很可愛，因為聖誕節每個酒瓶都戴了耶誕小帽圍圍巾，餐廳拿了很多wine spectator的證書應該很厲害，但這是啥？😆

喜歡這種貨真價實賣好食物好酒的地方","At the beginning of the beginning of the year, I finally settled in Xinya. When I lived in Tianmu, I had never had the opportunity to go to the steps. Every time I was full house! It ’s a good luck to eat on New Year's Day ☘️☘️☘️

I just ate a piece of Baguette and went to the pork Terrine. It was pretty refreshing with apple sauce and pickle. I thought of the meat eaten by Wooloomooloo with pickled purple cabbage. The messenger was not inferior to the Terrine here.

The frog legs are drizzled with Basil sauce and slightly red pepper powder.I like the onion soup, the bread will not be too large, the broth is a bit like the imported beef soup blocks I bought. I am a fast food taste buds developed by the food industry?

When ordering, I was lost in the choice of many main dishes. Finally, I chose the pigeon version of the pigeon pigeons and the pigeon pigeon.I rarely eat pigeons. Most French restaurants make it very raw for tender mouth, with a strong bloody smell; otherwise, I just have a paw, and the mood of drinking blood is not very good.Today's meringue is thick and thin, with a charming cream aroma, the breasts are not bloody, and the legs of the pigeons are also very tender. It is too perfect to dip the orange nectar. It is the favorite dish tonight.The meal wine with Longhe's red wine, the berry has a strong aroma and complement the meal.But in the end, I really can’t eat it at all, leaving a pigeon leg, I'm really sorry for the chef.

There are a lot of wine choices. I rarely meet Rose to order a single cup. There are three more choices!You can order a single cup or half a bottle (about 4 cups), I like it so much!

The atmosphere is very cute, because each wine bottle on Christmas is wearing a Christmas hat fence. It should be very powerful to take a lot of Wine Spectator's certificate, but what is it?Bleak

我們去的時候是情人節當天，大概是訂晚上7點。進去的時候餐廳已經有九成滿了，感覺生意還蠻好的。我男朋友從麵包一直讚不絕口到主菜。我一開始前菜點太多，後面的麵有點吃不完。他們家的餐點是有一定的水準，而且是好吃的。當天美中不足的地方是，後面有一群中年人，喝完酒之後，講話笑聲都很大聲，影響到全餐廳。後來有一個人說我們好像太大聲了，但講了這句話之後依然非常的大聲，所以我們連甜品都沒吃就先跑了。😑 …,"When we went to Valentine's Day, we were about 7 pm.When I went in, the restaurant was full of ninety percent, and the business was quite good.My boyfriend has been praised from bread to the main cuisine.I had too many meals from the beginning, and the noodles behind could not be eaten.Their meals have a certain level and delicious.The shortcomings of the United States that day were that there was a group of middle -aged people in the back.

分量剛好，食物好吃，服務也不差,"The weight is just right, the food is delicious, and the service is not bad",False
台北最好的法式餐廳，酒單超級豐富，侍酒師老闆可以幫你挑到最適合的酒，配每道都很誘人好吃的菜，非常適合小倆口約會，家人用餐,"The best French restaurant in Taipei, the wine list is super rich. The bartender boss can help you pick you the most suitable wine. It is very attractive and delicious.",False
餐前的法國麵包很好吃，伊比利豬排很嫩,"French bread before meals is delicious, and the Ibilia pork chop is very tender",False
服務態度不佳，應該不會再來。服務生來電確認訂位，因偕同長輩所以確認是否有靠邊座位，拉開桌距、隔板等措施。服務人員說都沒有，也沒考慮少接客人，跟服務人員說先考慮有需要再來電取消。結果到餐廳服務人員說沒訂位已取消座位，當場傻眼！所幸天母還有很多好吃餐廳，並沒有screw up 我們的聚餐。,"The service attitude is not good, and it should not come again.The waiter calls to confirm the reservation. Because of the same elders, it is confirmed whether there is a side seat, and the table distance and partition measures are opened.The service staff said no, and did not consider picking up less, and told the service staff to consider the need to call again.As a result, the service staff at the restaurant said that the seat was canceled without reservation, and she was dumbfounded on the spot!Fortunately, Tianmu still has a lot of delicious restaurants, and there is no Scream up dinner.",False

第一次嘗試這間法式餐廳，沒想到意外的：火腿有一股放過久的油耗味，之後湯的餃子吃起來有股冰箱味，推薦的酒丹寧味很重也並不搭配當天所點的主菜鴨肉，另外甜點也是有一股冰箱味......價格比例而言真的不應該有這樣的品質,"The first time I tried this French restaurant, I did not expect the accident: the ham has a long fuel consumption taste. After that, the dumplings of the soup have a refrigerator flavor. The main vegetable duck meat, and the dessert also has a refrigerator flavor ... The price ratio really should not have such quality",False
"興起想吃油封鴨腿，上網尋了一下家附近的餐廳，剛好部落客介紹馨亞。親臨之後，著實讓我失望許久，主餐點了油封鴨腿與羊排，餐點雖無驚艷但也可以接受。失望的是服務態度，ㄧ間價位不低的法國餐廳最基本的帶位與介紹餐廳特色菜這些都是很基本的事情，讓我們坐下後就沒了。我們自己請人員來點餐，送餐時主餐端上後放下就離開，我與先生訝異竟無簡單介紹一下。（佐料是搭配什麼之類的）這些真的都很基本我不在這方面多言。
總之仿佛像是對一份工作失去熱忱般，也許，疫情影響了大家。
溫馨提醒，花了部落客的費用寫了好幾篇文章，請盡可能如文章所寫會比較好。客人看了文章而前往，嘗試後體驗不佳，可能得不償失。","I wanted to eat oil -sealing duck legs, and went online to find a restaurant near home, just happened to introduce Xinya.After visiting it, I really disappointed me for a long time. The main meal ordered the oil seal duck legs and lamb chops. Although the meal was not amazing, it was acceptable.The disappointment is the service attitude. The most basic band of the French restaurant with a low price and the special dishes of the restaurant is very basic. Let us be gone after sitting.We invited the person to order for themselves. When the meal was put on the main meal, we left and left. My husband and I were surprised to introduce it briefly.(What is the matching of the condiments?) These are really basically not in this regard.
In short, it seems like losing enthusiasm for a job, maybe the epidemic affects everyone.

今天點了燉豬腳、伊比利豬排、野菇松露義大利麵，前菜是烤田螺，還有南瓜湯，每一道都很有水準，伊比利豬比我在信義區五星飯店吃到的好很多，沒有豬腥味，切下去呈現粉紅色，肉汁豐富，燉豬腳非常軟嫩，可以輕易切開，入口即化，印象深刻。我的野菇松露麵很香，醬汁濃稠度剛剛好，非常非常好吃啊。每一道都吃光光，他們是台北少數會做法式甜點沙巴雍的餐廳，很值得專程造訪。,"Today I ordered the stewed pig's feet, Iberbille pork chop, wild mushroom truffle splash noodles. The front dishes are roasted field snails, and pumpkin soup. Each is very standard. Ibilia piglets are much better than I have eaten in Wuxing Hotel in Xinyi District. There is no pig fishy smell.
