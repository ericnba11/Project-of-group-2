"沒什麼禮貌的調酒師，默默看著顧客從眼前離開，可能因為我們不夠懂酒他覺得不配（？）不然我實在想不到有什麼理由說明從他正面起身離開沒打招呼的原因。
另外在消費的過程中對於我們滿冷淡的，對別的客人有說有笑，可能會挑客人吧？？
我們每個人也點了2杯，消費3千多，整體我覺得還沒到那個價值，不過音樂選得不錯，當天印象最深刻的居然是王傑的老歌和沒禮貌的調酒師","There was no polite bartender, silently watching the customer leave from the front, maybe because we don't understand the wine, he doesn't think it is worthy (?) Otherwise, I really can't think of the reason why there is any reason why he got up from him and left without saying hello.
In addition, in the process of consumption, we are cold for us, say and laughed with other guests, maybe pick people?Intersection
Each of us also ordered 2 cups, spending more than 3,000, I don't think the value is the whole, but the music is good. The most impressive that day is Wang Jie's old song and a rude bartender.",False
"老闆偏有個性，所以如果想要比較有熱情的服務，可能需要再斟酌一下,一人作業，所以速度會比較慢一些，我9：50點的酒，基本上10：20才上，酒整體勉強及格， 點的sidecar酸苦感個人覺得過重，整體而言可嚐鮮，但二訪可能需要再考慮一下","The boss has a personality, so if you want to have more enthusiastic services, you may need to consider it again.

非常有匠人氣息的一間酒吧，在一個酒莊的地下室，店內並沒有酒單但大家都說經典調酒非常有水準，朋友說那杯是他喝過最好喝的old fashioned!!

"Kashoku
如果沒有人指路還可能真的找不到
隱身在酒專裏，走入地下室的小小空間，別有一番天地
點了一杯Penicillin，基本的黑牌跟阿貝10，入口非常清爽，薑味並不突出，整體非常平衡，非常有水準的一杯酒，而且展哥的shake真的很帥，非常有氣勢。
第二杯在Joe推薦下點了一杯Daiquiri
看到上面飄著的碎冰就知道這杯Daiquiri很厲害，入口果真非常驚艷，Rum的味道非常凸顯
特地問了一下用的Rum是什麼Rum，
來自加勒比海Veritas 調和蘭姆酒
由Foursquare的column still rum和來自牙買加的Hampden調和而成（上網查的）
整體甜感不多，
酸、澀、帶有一點塑膠味，第一次喝到真的很Dry的Daiquiri，dry但是很好入喉，上面的碎冰讓整體非常清爽

老實說每個月的酒錢其實遠遠超過餐費
但比起推薦餐廳，我很少會跟朋友說哪間酒吧很棒，一定要去。
畢竟大部分的人吃飯的目的都相同，都是為了吃到好吃的食物
但喝酒，大家目的不同，有些人想醉、有些人想鬆、有些人想玩、有些人不知道喝酒到底有什麼樂趣…
我對於Kashoku的定位就是一個人自己去的地方，看著調酒師做酒，聽著音樂慢慢的喝完一杯酒","Kashoku
If no one is pointing to the road, it may really not be found
I hidden in the wine college, and walk into the small space of the basement, don’t have a world
I ordered a cup of Penicillin. The basic black cards and Abe 10 are very refreshing. The ginger flavor is not prominent. The overall is very balanced. It is very standardized. And Zhan Brother's Shake is really handsome and imposing.
The second cup was clicked on a cup of Daiquiri under the recommendation of Joe
Seeing the broken ice floating on it, I know that this cup of Daiquiri is very powerful, the entrance is really amazing, and the taste of Rum is very prominent
I asked what Rum used for a bit,
From the Caribbean VERITAS reconcile Rim
It is made up by FourSquare's Column Still Rum and Hampden from Jamaica (checked online)
The overall sweetness is not much,
Sour, astringent, with a little plastic taste, Daiquiri, who is really DRY for the first time, is very good, but it is very easy to enter the throat. The broken ice on it makes the whole very refreshing

To be honest
But compared to recommending restaurants, I rarely tell my friends which bar is great, and I must go.
After all, most people eat the same purpose, they are to eat delicious food
But drinking, everyone has different purposes, some people want to be drunk, some people want to loosen, some people want to play, some people do not know what fun to drink ...
My positioning of Kashoku is where one person goes by himself. Watching the bartender make wine, listening to the music slowly drank a glass of wine",False

"維持一兩個月到訪一次Kashoku的頻率也若干年，近期才發現居然沒有留下評論過。或許一則是深感自己「評論」Kashoku的工藝實在不很夠格，二來也希望它們持續的低調下去。

很棒的地下酒吧。他們的氛圍滿分！請發揮創意，並為調酒師提供盡可能多的提示，因為他們知識淵博、專業且才華橫溢。請原諒我不太清楚我點的是什麼——我只知道它酸甜爽口。下次會嘗試點一些特別的東西（並帶足夠的現金）。哈哈,"Great underground bar.Their atmosphere is full!Please give full play to creativity and provide as many prompts as possible for the bartender, because they are knowledgeable, professional and talented.Please forgive me what I order -I only know it is sweet and sour.I will try some special things (with enough cash) next time.Ha ha",False
這家酒吧的氣氛類似日本威士忌酒吧。這個地方氣氛平靜。店主也有在日本當調酒師的經驗，所以如果你告訴我們你想要什麼基礎，他就會為你調製一杯雞尾酒。他們庫存有各種威士忌，包括蘇格蘭威士忌和波本威士忌，但不幸的是，他們沒有庫存在韓國很容易找到的威士忌。但是，如果您想嘗試新類型，這裡是推薦的地方。,"The atmosphere of this bar is similar to the Japanese whiskey bar.The atmosphere of this place is calm.The owner also has the experience of being a bartender in Japan, so if you tell us what foundation you want, he will prepare a cup of cocktail for you.They have various whiskeys, including Scotch whiskey and Pochimo whiskey, but unfortunately, they have no whiskey that is easy to find in South Korea.However, if you want to try a new type, this is the recommended place.",False

調酒師總是帶給我美味的雞尾酒！  這是我在台北最喜歡的酒吧之一！,The bartender always brings me delicious cocktail!This is one of my favorite bars in Taipei!,False
對於認真對待日式雞尾酒的人來說，這是一個非常好的地方。店主和調酒師真的花了很多心思來調製好酒。關於負評：這是他們的店，他們可以按照他們的規定經營，例如不能超過4人，不可以吃東西，每個人都必須喝酒等等。我喜歡這個地方的經營方式。,"This is a very good place for those who are seriously treating Japanese cocktails.The owner and the bartender really spent a lot of thoughts to prepare the wine.About negative reviews: This is their shop. They can operate in accordance with their regulations, such as not more than 4 people, not to eat, everyone must drink and so on.I like the operation of this place.",False
起初我不知道會發生什麼，我的朋友告訴我「這是一個很棒的酒吧，試試看」。喝了 4 杯令人驚嘆的飲料後，我必須同意，這是一家很棒的酒吧，你也應該嘗試 👍🏼🙂 …,"At first I didn't know what would happen. My friend told me, ""This is a great bar, try it.""After drinking 4 cups of amazing drinks, I must agree, this is a great bar, you should try it ...",False

非常酷的酒吧（一個地下酒吧；在一家葡萄酒商店的地下室，晚上不營業，所以如果你不打電話叫進去，金屬門就會被拉下來）。沒有菜單，這個地方主要供應經典飲料。去的那天晚上，我點了雞尾酒（大約新台幣400元/杯）。,"Very cool bar (a basement bar; in the basement of a wine shop, not open at night, so if you don't call in, the metal door will be pulled down).There is no menu, this place mainly supplies classic drinks.The night when I went, I ordered the cocktail (about NT $ 400/cup).",False
令人驚嘆的服務和飲料。調酒師知識淵博，可以根據您喜歡的口味調製飲料。沒有菜單。只收現金。精選爵士黑膠唱片。來這裡吧，你不會後悔的。,"Amazing service and drinks.The knowledge of the bartender can make drinks according to your favorite taste.No menu.Cash only.Selected Jygns vinyl records.Come here, you won't regret it.",False
"一個有很棒飲料的好地方。調酒師真的了解任何種類的酒。

地下。氣氛很好。調酒師也很棒！,underground.The atmosphere is very good.The bartender is also great!,False
"這是一個很棒的小地方，是我從其他幾家酒吧的工作人員的推薦中發現的。

進入樓上的品酒室，然後走樓梯下去。您將進入“Kashoku”，這裡無疑是日本風格的。長長的吧台在狹小的空間拉長了房間的長度。

沒有菜單，所以首要任務是與工作人員討論飲料偏好。經過一些簡單的問題後，調酒師似乎很滿意並開始為我們調製飲料。結果是：一款極其獨特的雞尾酒，其基調中含有蕨類植物獵人。我真的很喜歡第一杯雞尾酒，我又要了第二杯，它也同樣令人印象深刻（Midori 的一種有趣的非酸風格使用）。

這裡的氣氛非常悠閒安靜，電唱機傳來輕柔的音樂充滿了整個空間。工作人員熱情友好——很樂意根據您的要求與酒吧後面有趣的東西相匹配。當我們凌晨 1 點左右到達那裡時，當地人和遊客混在一起。如果您是銀座酒吧的粉絲，這絕對會讓您心癢癢。","This is a great place, which I discovered from the recommendations of the staff of several other bars.

Enter the wine tasting room upstairs, and then go down the stairs.You will enter ""Kashoku"", which is undoubtedly Japanese style.The long bar stretchs the length of the room in a small space.

There is no menu, so the primary task is to discuss drinking preferences with staff.After some simple problems, the bartender seemed to be satisfied and began to prepare drinks for us.As a result, an extremely unique cocktail contains fern plant hunters in its tone.I really like the first cup of cocktails, and I want the second cup again, it is also impressive (a interesting non -acid style of Midori).

The atmosphere here is very leisurely and quiet, and the soft music comes from the electric singer is full of space.The staff is enthusiastic and friendly -happy to match the interesting things behind the bar according to your requirements.When we arrived at around 1 am, the locals and tourists were mixed.If you are a fan of Ginza Bar, this will definitely make you feel itchy.",False

位於葡萄酒商店地下室的日本地下酒吧。飲料非常好，威士忌是他們的特色菜，所以大多數雞尾酒都會以威士忌為基礎。飲料非常烈，所以在去那裡之前最好不要喝太多！,"Located in the basement of the basement of the wine store.The drinks are very good, whiskey is their specialty, so most cocktails are based on whiskey.The drink is very strong, so it is best not to drink too much before going there!",False
請不要參觀這個酒吧。他們沒有提供菜單。我們花了3000多新台幣，他們說只收現金。我們要求提供收據，以查看我們訂購的九種飲料的詳細情況。他們說我們必須手寫給你。他們最終沒有提供收據。一定是偷稅漏稅。糟糕的服務和態度,"Please don't visit this bar.They did not provide menu.We spent more than NT $ 3,000, and they said they only collect cash.We ask for a receipt to check the details of the nine beverages we ordered.They said we have to hand in hand.They did not provide receipts in the end.It must be tax evasion.Bad service and attitude",False
