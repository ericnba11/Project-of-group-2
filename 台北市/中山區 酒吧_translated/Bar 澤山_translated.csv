為了紅絲絨蛋糕而來，整顆真的很對胃，顏色也好美，蛋糕體濕潤點更優，建議一定要預留，現場沒庫存的機率非常高。酒食也不馬虎，吃過的幾道都蠻優秀的。調酒也不錯，可以客製調整風味，台北酒吧推薦好店～,"For the red velvet cake, the whole piece is really very good at the stomach, the color is beautiful, and the cake body is more moist. It is recommended to reserve it. The probability of no inventory at the scene is very high.The wine and food are not sloppy.Bart -up is also good, you can customize the flavor, the Taipei bar recommends a good shop ~"

🖊️一間職人精神的fine bar: 酒跟食物表現都很精彩
-
店內燈光偏暗，會在桌子上方打一盞燈，讓客人好好專注食物跟酒。
菜單呈現是以料理加上酒做pairing，每道料理其背後都是老闆的用心以及透過各種工法而呈現出來的食物，即便菜單上寫著堅果跟薯條，都不馬乎，色香味俱全，再搭配上適當的調酒或手沖咖啡，真的是一個很棒的體驗。
🥇目前Bar澤山是心目中排名第一的酒吧，把菜單上的料理幾乎都點過一輪，每一道都令人驚艷。調酒也可以依據自己喜好的口味跟風格，和老闆做討論。
老闆們很好聊、Bar氣氛也很好，會好好的介紹每一道食物、關心客人對食物對酒的口味喜好。
-
即便每一道料理都令人眼睛為之一亮，還是排出主管口味想推薦的：
1. 起士豆腐：整道料理完全沒有豆腐，透過不同起士的組合在搭配上紫蘇花、茶粉以及蜂蜜，一口接著一口，本就喜歡吃乳酪的我，更是對這樣的搭配念念不忘。
2. 堅果：老闆用心製作，反覆的工法，炒烤加上調味的肉桂及其他佐料，讓我們一連點了三份堅果。
3. 釜飯：每一口充斥著蟹肉、蛋、飯及各種佐料，誰都不搶戲，整體很協調，可以很滿足的吃完
4. 手沖：驚艷無比，冰手沖的風味也不減，一定要來一杯。

即便菜單上的蛋糕是和別人合作的，也可以吃出老闆挑選的用心，不是隨便的蛋糕。
一個小彩蛋是有一個賣肉粽的阿伯會進來銷售肉粽，這肉粽也是老闆說過認可的。而這確實是我吃過好吃、大顆又清爽的肉粽，配上調酒也好適合。

神️ Fine Bar, the spirit of a staff member: wine and food performance are wonderful

The lights in the shop are darker, and a lamp will be shot above the table to allow guests to focus on food and wine.
The menu presentation is the dishes and wine as a pairing. Behind each of the dishes is the intention of the boss and the food presented through various methods. It is really a great experience with appropriate bartending or hand -coffee coffee.
是 At present, Bar Zeshan is the first bar in his mind. Almost a round of dishes on the menu, each of which is amazing.Bart -up can also discuss with the boss according to the taste and style you like.
The bosses are very good to talk, BAR atmosphere is also very good. They will introduce every food and care about the tastes of the food for the taste of food.

Even if every dish is bright, the eyes are brightened, and the taste of the supervisor wants to recommend:
1. Kitza tofu: There is no tofu at all. Through the combination of different cheese, it is matched with perilla flower, tea powder and honey. After a bite, I like to eat cheese. Don't forget.
2. Nuts: The boss made with your heart, repeated construction methods, stir -fried and seasoned cinnamon and other condiments, let us order three nuts in a row.
3. 一 每: Each bite is full of crab meat, eggs, rice and various condiments. No one grabs the show. The overall is very coordinated.
4. Hands: Stunning, the flavor of the ice hand is not reduced, you must have a cup.

Even if the cake on the menu is cooperated with others, you can eat the heart selected by the boss, not a casual cake.
A small egg is an Aber who sells meat to sell meat dumplings. This meat dumplings have also been recognized by the boss.And this is indeed a delicious, large and refreshing meat rice dumplings, which is suitable for bartending.

"【食在台北：Bar 澤山】

Bar 澤山是我近期的心頭好，
好吃好喝，難得飲食和調酒水準都精彩。

Bar 澤山就在我們諮商所和工作室附近，
尤其營業時間對我很友善，
深夜能有 Fine Dining 等級下酒菜，
搭配精心製作的調酒，實在幸福。

Bar 澤山是一家 bar，重點當然是酒。

我對調酒認識尚淺，沒辦法評論多專業，
但我的酒鬼友人們力推，那就是肯定好，
我的感覺是順口平衡又好喝，
雖然讓我有這樣的感覺並不容易。

Bar 澤山的餐點莫名合我胃口，
有湯有菜有飯有甜點，完全可以當正餐吃，
日式中式義式美式，沒什麼框架規則，
整體感覺是在口味上有點想法，但不亂搞。
每道菜都算有亮點，調味風格我也喜歡，
我每次去只是想喝點小酒、吃點小東西，
然後每次都一不小心吃太飽…

在我暴點一堆餐點後，一杯一杯搭配酒，
這樣的體驗，跟我說是在高級餐廳我也相信。","[Eat in Taipei: Bar Zeshan]

Bar Zeshan is my recent heart,
It is delicious and delicious, and the rare levels of diet and alcohol are wonderful.

Bar Zeshan is near our consultation office and the studio,
Especially business hours are very friendly to me,
You can have a Fine Dining level in the middle of the night.
It is really happy with the elaborate bartending.

Bar Zeshan is a family, of course, the focus is on wine.

I still have a shallow understanding of bartend
But my drunkard friends push hard, that is, it is certain,
My feeling is smooth, balanced and delicious,
Although it makes me feel like this, it is not easy.

Bar Zeshan's meals are inexplicably intertwined with my stomach,
There are soups, vegetables, rice, and desserts. You can eat it as a meal.
Japanese -style Chinese -style Italian American style, there are no framework rules,
The overall feeling is a bit of thought in taste, but not messy.
Every dish is considered a highlight, I like the seasoning style,
Every time I go, I just want to drink a small wine and eat something,
Then I accidentally eat too much every time ...

After I violently ordered a meal, a glass of wine with wine,
This experience tells me that I believe in a high -end restaurant."

"澤山位在林森北路的巷子內，門口的視覺非常簡單但澤山而兩個字體給人一種質感爆棚的感覺。入店店內位子不多大約14個位子，6個吧臺作為兩張4人桌（提醒去之前請看店家ig的規則，不接待四人以上）。吧臺作為非常的有套餐儀式感，一套銀製的餐具配上黑上小盤子，店家馬上遞上水杯放在一盞照在桌上的聚光燈下，像極一幅畫作，讓人準備好開始跟著店家開始一場藝術表演。
菜單部分，有別於一般酒吧菜單設計，店家強調的是餐酒搭配，每個頁面主要是一道店家設計的菜餚，下方則是建議搭配的調酒，調酒部分由經典有店家特調，若想了解的更細節都可以和店員做詢問，讓自己找到適合的餐點搭配自己喜愛的調酒。
這次初訪，剛好老闆有隱藏菜單的熟成魚生火腿，搭配一些佐料味道非常香甜舒服，店家推薦我搭配經典調酒bamboo，搭配起來讓整道菜有更豐富的口感，吃起來也更不膩口，一口魚一口酒，實在舒服。
澤山店家不大裝潢偏暗但充滿簡單帶來的質感，店員親切且介紹的清楚，當天體驗下來實在太難忘了！","Zeshan is located in the alley on the north road of Linsen. The vision at the door is very simple, but Zeshan and the two fonts give people a sense of texture.There are not many seats in the store in the store, and 6 bar tables are used as two 4 -person tables (reminding you to see the rules of the store IG before you go, and do not receive more than four people).As a very sense of set meal ritual, the bar is a set of silver tableware with a small black plate. The store immediately handes the water cup and placed on a spotlight shot on the table. Follow the store to start an art performance.
The menu section is different from the design of the general bar menu. The store emphasizes meal wine matching. Each page is mainly designed by a shop. Below is recommended to mix. If you want to know more details, you can ask the clerk, let yourself find a suitable meal with your favorite bartending.
At the beginning of this visit, the boss just had a hidden menu's cooked fish raw ham. It was very sweet and comfortable with some condiments. The store recommended me to match the classic bartender Bamboo. Not greasy, a bite of fish and wine is really comfortable.
Zeshan stores are not very decorated with dark but full of simple texture. The clerk is kind and introduced clearly. The experience of the day is really unforgettable!"
"在這裡
酒 是主角，
食物襯托著每一道酒，相輔相成","Here
Wine is the protagonist,
Food sets off every wine, complement each other"
"老闆很有個性，對酒的理解頗深，超級健談，人又客氣，酒吧的氛圍非常好，裝潢氣氛都很適合約會，而且很安靜可以用正常音量跟同行的人聊天
這家店的概念就是每款酒都有各自搭配的料理，是真的蠻搭的，食材確實用心，料理的價格也是相當合理
老闆的理念是以酒本身的調性去做調酒，廚房調理的部分只能佔調酒20%以內，因為他認為這樣才能嚐到酒廠蒸餾的風味，雖然跟我的喜好相距甚遠，但我完全可以理解，喜歡經典或是酒感重的人應該會喜歡這家
之所以不是五顆星是因為CP值，每一杯價位落在$450-$480，沒有服務費，這個定價我沒有意見，但份量真的太少了，從shake杯到酒杯，所有東西都好像迷你版😂每一杯都差不多三口可以喝完，即便喝了兩杯也還是處於一個相當清醒的狀態，CP值低不是因為定價太高，而是份量真的太少，除此之外我是覺得沒什麼缺點，還是值得來嘗嘗鮮，畢竟食物跟調酒的搭配體驗還是挺特別的","The boss is very individual, has a deep understanding of wine, super talkative, polite people, the atmosphere of the bar is very good, the decoration atmosphere is very suitable for dating, and it is very quiet to chat with those who use normal volume.
The concept of this shop is that each wine has their own dishes. It is really pretty. The ingredients are indeed attentive. The price of cooking is quite reasonable.
The concept of the boss is to mix with the tone of the wine itself. The part of the kitchen conditioning can only occupy less than 20%of the bartender, because he thinks that this can taste the distillation of the winery, although it is far from my preference. But I can understand that people who like classic or strong wine should like this house
The reason why it is not five stars is because of the CP value. The price of each cup is $ 450- $ 480. There is no service fee. I have no opinion in this pricing, but the amount is really small. From Shake Cup to Winers, everything seems to be a mini version.不 Each cup can be used for almost three mouthfuls. Even if you drink two cups, you are still in a very sober state. The low CP value is not because the price is too high, but the portion is really too small. In addition, I feel that there are no shortcomings. It is still worth trying up, after all, the combination of food and bartending is quite special."
"非常安靜的酒吧 跟朋友一起來聊聊天很舒服
酒都很好喝
食物都超級酷 紅絲絨杯子蛋糕推推
老闆人很好 不知道要點什麼都可以問老闆推薦","Very quiet bar is very comfortable to chat with friends
Wine is delicious

"餐點：
（餐點部分都是個人主觀，請不要抱過多期待以免影響體驗）

油封螢烏賊：
用小米和芥末籽以及番茄乾搭配當季的銀烏賊，鹹香海味配上芥末籽和番茄乾的微酸真的超好吃

焦糖堅果：
焦糖的綜合堅果，表現中規中矩，有些微苦覺得還有調整的空間，但搭配酒一樣是很棒的組合

虎皮奶油味噌牛筋：
這道非常的驚嘆！漂亮的醬色但味道不會很濃、牛筋跟白蘿蔔味道都很棒，尤其白蘿蔔配上柚子胡椒真的是絕配，另外還有奶油布里歐麵包，站著醬汁吃完美突顯出奶油香氣！

調酒：
第一杯：zero negroni
香味很奔放、清爽是一杯很明亮的negroni和焦糖堅果搭配也很棒

第二杯：vesper
非常平衡，味道非常乾淨優雅，淡淡的草本味把酒感隱藏的很好

第三杯：espresso martini
不同一般常喝到的，不會太甜可以更突顯咖啡的味道（老闆說是70%巧克力的苦甜感），是一杯很棒的咖啡調酒","Meal:
(The meal part is personal subjective, please do not expect too much to avoid affecting the experience)

Oil sealing fireflies squid:
Use millet and mustard seeds and dried tomatoes with silver squid in the season. The salty sea flavor with mustard seeds and dried tomato is really delicious

Caramel nuts:
The comprehensive nuts of caramels are quite satisfactory, and some bitter feelings still feel that there is room for adjustment, but it is a great combination with wine.

Tiger skin cream miso beef tendon:
This is very amazing!The beautiful sauce color but the taste is not very strong, the beef tendon and white radish taste great, especially the white radish with grapefruit pepper is really a perfect match. Creamy aroma!

Bartending:
The first cup: Zero Negroni
The fragrance is very unrestrained and refreshing is a very bright Negroni and caramel nuts.

Second Cup: Vesper
Very balanced, the taste is very clean and elegant.

Third Cup: Espresso Martini
Different often drink it, it is not too sweet to highlight the taste of coffee (the boss said it is the bitter sweetness of 70%chocolate), it is a great cup of coffee"
"心中2022最優質的cocktail pairing &
classic cocktail twist
重構的經典調酒更優雅、耐人尋味。氣氛寧靜而禪意，好愛那一整幅中式山水畫。

餐酒搭配追求1+1>2，嚐一口酒再吃食物味覺更強烈，回頭喝酒，香料彼此在口中混合出迷人而細緻的香氣，多美的循環。每一道搭配都在入口瞬間深深感受到店家對美食美酒的愛。","The highest quality Cocktail Pairing & in the heart of 2022

牛舌搭配甜莓果醬入口即化，口感很好。
如果還有機會來還會再多點一些酒，今天點了很特別的阿拉巴馬監獄，屬於清爽型，之後還想嘗試其他的","The most recommended cheese tofu and fried beef tongue. The taste of cheese tofu is perfectly balanced and very delicious.
The beef tongue with sweet berry jam is melted as soon as possible, and the taste is good.

先炸後烤 灑上一點起士跟炸培根 旁邊的青紅花椒美乃滋還行 個人覺得不沾享受馬鈴薯的綿密即可 療癒胖

▫️牛小排
欸 裡面的焦糖炒鳳梨太加分
牛排比較普通 就是義式的精實牛 但表面的梅納有出來

以馬丁尼為主場的pairing我個人沒有很熱衷 基本上無酒單 盡情和調酒師碰撞出火花吧～環境我愛 可以是續攤約會好選擇","️Mvp cheese tofu
Without tofu is the complete Cream Cheese+Mazka collapse, it is too bad to pour honey around oolong tea powder and perilla flower.

饼️ Lotus root cake
Too evil Lotus root meat grinding meat thousands of layers pass through Japanese -style fried

️ Cow tongue stick/rice
It should be soft and tender squares at the root of the tongue
There is also a meal of rice and minced garlic.
But I still like to fight with French sticks the most

果️ Cinnamon Nuts
Wish House Division, please Jiajiajun

▫️ potato
First fried and then baked with a little green, red peppercorns next to the fried bacon, and the same person. I can heal the dense if you do n’t stick to the dense potato.

▫️ Niu Xiao Pai
The caramel fried pineapple inside is too extra points
Steak is relatively common to be intellectual, but the surface of Mena is out.

Pairing with Martini is not very enthusiastic about the sparks without the bartender without a lot of wine. I love the environment."
酒單要在Instagram 上看，對於一些減少社交軟體使用的人來說較為不便,The wine list should be viewed on Instagram. It is more inconvenient for some people who reduce social software
"調酒跟搭配的餐點都非常驚艷
尤其是布里歐許烤得真的超級好吃😋
老闆娘也超級可愛跟我們分享了很多關於他們餐點的設想❤️","The meals of bartending and matching are very amazing
Especially Brills Xu is really so delicious 😋
The boss is also super cute to share a lot of ideas about their meals ❤️"
"店內佈置蠻有日式氣氛
每道菜吃起來與看菜名時想像有點不同

1.起士豆腐 滿好吃，但裡面沒有豆腐，都是起士，吃起來有點像甜品。
2.雞干貝濃湯 好喝
3.金甲千層蓮藕餅：滿費工製作的，層層分明有酥脆感
4.開心果小羔羊排：羊排有點小

但整體菜色整合性可以高些","There is a Japanese -style atmosphere in the store
Each dish is a bit different from when looking at the name of the dish

1. The cheese tofu is delicious, but there is no tofu inside, it is a cheese, and it tastes a bit like desserts.
2. Chicken scallop soup is delicious
3. Golden armor thousand layers of lotus root cakes: made of full -time work, clearly crispy layers
4. Happy Fruit Lamb Chop: Lamb Chop is a bit small

But the integration of overall dishes can be higher"
老闆跟老闆娘很用心的做每一道料理跟每一杯酒🤤 注重每個細節跟層次的那種！,The boss and the boss do each dish and every glass of wine at the same level and pay attention to the kind of every detail and layer!
"很喜歡店內的裝潢跟氣氛
酒食部分倒是沒有想像中驚艷
干貝雞湯個人覺得喝起來有股冰箱味
但朋友蠻喜歡的
牛舌則燉得軟爛入味 有讚但份量偏少
整體價格偏高","I like the decoration and atmosphere in the store very much
The wine food part is not amazing in imagination
The shell chicken soup personally feels like drinking a refrigerator flavor
But friends like it
The beef tongue is soft and rotten.
The overall price is high"
"推薦嘗試起司豆腐，十分美味與特別！
至於酒飲曼哈頓，覺得有點辣口，湯品雖濃郁但略鹹。
整體體驗，個人覺得餐點與價格比稍嫌有所落差。","It is recommended to try cheese tofu, which is very delicious and special!
As for the drinking Manhattan, I feel a bit spicy. Although the soup is strong but slightly salty.
Overall experience, I personally feel that the meal is slightly different from the price."
"氣氛很好+店員有很認真介紹每道！
每杯調酒跟小點都感覺有用滿滿的心去製作！！！
最喜歡蓮藕餅完全吃不出蓮藕的感覺！！其實可以一次吃兩份都沒問題🥹
平常不喝盤尼西林但覺得他們的東方盤尼西林很順也不會甜膩！ …","The atmosphere is very good+the clerk has carefully introduced every!
Every cup of bartending and small dots feel full of heart!IntersectionIntersection
I like the lotus root cake the most likely to eat the lotus root!IntersectionIn fact, you can eat two copies at a time.
Usually do not drink Nicalelin, but feel that their Oriental Pancaler is very smooth and not sweet!Mowing"
餐點搭配酒品，但不強求一定要點用，非常有日式風格的店家。每道餐點的食材及烹飪方式都很特別，唯一缺點是稍貴有點沒吃飽。沒記錯的話不能刷卡但是可以Line pay,"The meal is matched with wine, but it is necessary to use it without force. It is very Japanese -style shop.The ingredients and cooking methods of each meal are very special. The only disadvantage is that it is slightly more expensive and not full.If you remember correctly, you can't swipe the card, but you can like to pay"

There will be a dish on the menu and the recommendation with the recommended wine below
The meal is delicious, and the level of wine is also very high

自家調的cocktails都超級棒！很推薦coffee&champagne還有zero negroni。maple syrup nuts和cheese tofu都超厲害超喜歡的。環境很好重要是老闆娘人也很好👍會回訪的。,"Cocktails that are adjusted are superb!It is recommended to be Coffee & Champagne and Zero Negroni.Maple Syrup Nuts and Cheese Tofu are very good and very good.The environment is very important, and the boss is also very good."
"整體是蠻有趣的體驗，
但大概平常喝酒都走粗暴路線，個人覺得酒精類飲品略顯輕鬆🤣🤣🤣","The overall is a pretty interesting experience,
But probably often take a rough route when drinking, I personally feel that alcoholic drinks are slightly relaxed."
完美無暇！～ 一入口，瞬間有種我以前喝的到底是什麼的os⋯ 不管是調酒、甜點、咖啡、氣氛、每一樣是高質感！ 老闆人又好，無私分享豐富知識，以後回台必踩點之一！,"Perfect!~ At the entrance, there is an OS that I used to drink in an instant. Whether it is bartending, desserts, coffee, atmosphere, every high quality!The boss is good, and selflessly share rich knowledge."

"在陰沉、別緻的氛圍中享用美味的雞尾酒，搭配美味的食物。

我們從巴斯克起司蛋糕與濃縮咖啡馬丁尼和煙燻巧克力開始。這些飲料非常美味，而且不太甜，與蛋糕的黃油光滑度完美搭配。

接下來我們又喝了 Mixed Sour 和 The Deck，這無疑是我在台灣有幸嘗試過的最獨特的飲料。酸味有濃鬱的木質香，微甜，帶有發酵茶的香氣。與此同時，Deck 有一種強烈的干燥餘味，讓我們感到驚訝，而且沒有一絲其他酒吧所依賴的不必要的甜味。

非常值得花這個錢，因為這個地方真正為飲料和服務品質設定了高標準。","Enjoy delicious cocktails in a gloomy and unique atmosphere, with delicious food.

We started from the Basque cheese cake and concentrated coffee Martini and smoky chocolate.These drinks are very delicious and not too sweet, and perfectly matched with the butter of the cake.

Next, we drank Mixed Sour and The Deck again, which is undoubtedly the most unique drink I have tried in Taiwan.The sour taste has a strong woody fragrance, slightly sweet, with the aroma of fermented tea.At the same time, DECK has a strong dryness, which surprises us, and there is no unnecessary sweetness that other bars depends on.

Very worth spending this money, because this place really sets high standards for drinks and service quality."
調酒師知識淵博，始終保持良好的秩序。氣氛很好而且不太吵。酒類、利口酒、苦味酒的選擇真的很豐富，還有非常好的咖啡（向咖啡師大喊！！）在那裡度過了美好的 4.5 小時！,"The knowledge of the bartender has always maintained a good order.The atmosphere is very good and not too noisy.The choice of alcohol, liquid wine, and bitter wine is really rich, and there are very good coffee (shouting to the barista !!!) There is a beautiful 4.5 hours there!"
"氣氛、食物和飲料都很棒。
豆腐起司菜是我們非常講究的一道菜，味道也很棒！","The atmosphere, food and drink are great.
