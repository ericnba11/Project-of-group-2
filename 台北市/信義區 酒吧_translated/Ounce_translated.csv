"台北經典 speakeasy 酒吧之一。

"Hands down the best bar in Taipei.

當我想到去酒吧，第一個從腦海跳出來的一定是Ounce，雖然因為是熟人開的所以有些偏愛，但他的優秀真的是毋庸置疑～

調酒方面，並無固定的酒單，走得是客製化路線，雖然這樣有些微風險，然而其表現通常都還滿不錯至優秀，經典酒款方面則當然表現良好，層次感也都分明，讓人能享受手中那杯調酒，感受冰塊融化時又帶來另一種口感～

食物方面選擇不多，走的是下酒小食路線，非常好的策略，畢竟其定位是酒吧而非餐酒館，不必多樣化而反而沒做好～先跟大家說炸薯條跟雞翅就是讚，點就對了不用懷疑，絕佳下酒！

最後是氛圍面， Ounce是Speak easy，因此首先是那神秘感，但當人多起來時，相較小的空間呈現的是熱絡，再加上服務員與bar tender 都非常熱情也會送shots，為體驗上再畫龍點睛！

Ounce 能在台北生存這麼久是有原因的，特別是在信義安和這一級戰區中，儘管不再是Asia Top 50, but it’s always Timmy’s Taipei Top 3 ;)","Hands down the best bar in Taipei.

When I thought of going to the bar, the first one who jumped out of my mind must be OUNCE. Although it is a bit preferred because it is an acquaintance, his excellence is really unquestionable ~

In terms of bartending, there is no fixed wine list. It takes a customized route. Although there are some micro -risks, their performance is usually good and excellent. Of course, the classic wine is good. Of course , Let people enjoy the cup of bartending in their hands, and feel another taste when I feel the melting of the ice cubes ~

There are not many food choices. It is a very good strategy. After all, it is positioned as a bar instead of a dining tavern. It's right, don't doubt it, it's great to get wine!

Finally, the atmosphere is at the atmosphere. Once is a Speak Easy, so the first is the mystery, but when there are more people, the small space is hot. In addition, the waiter and Bar Tender are very enthusiastic and they will send Shots. Draw the finishing touch for experience!

步入盎司並前往紐約！我花了一個晚上和店主（一位來自紐約的外籍人士）聊了聊這件事。這家酒吧充滿了正宗的輕鬆口語，由出色的健談調酒師提供創意雞尾酒。世界上其他地方還能找到黃綠色利口酒和其他很難找到的利口酒。讓琴酒和滋補品愛好者退到一邊，讓他們以口味領先的口味來滿足您的需求。威士忌和朗姆酒的選擇也很大，很難找到。,"Step into ounces and go to New York!I spent a night with the shopkeeper (a foreigner from New York) and talked about it.This bar is full of authentic eloquence, providing creative cocktails by excellent tactical bartender.Yellow -green liquor wines and other liquor wines that are difficult to find in other parts of the world can be found.Let the piano wine and nourishment enthusiasts retreat and let them meet your needs with the taste of the taste.The choice of whiskey and lum is also very large, and it is difficult to find.",False

該評論純粹基於服務品質。三年後我回到這裡，希望能參觀我曾經喜歡的酒吧。哇，太震驚了。帶我們進去的女士因為我問是否有台灣風味的雞尾酒而感到非常生氣。她說：“這是一家美國酒吧。”用她超濃重的東歐口音強調美國特色。環顧四周..這絕對不是一家“美國”酒吧，因為它不是一家體育酒吧。我告訴她我住在美國，然後她開始說別的話，因為坦白說，她看起來像是剛從俄羅斯飛來的。可悲的是，服務很糟糕。等了半小時才拿到支票。她甚至沒有過來。我們不得不步行到酒吧並付款。感謝上帝，他們沒有要求美國人給小費，哈哈。再也不會了。我走到轉角處的「Bar Without」。優質的服務和美味的雞尾酒讓一切好上一百萬倍！,"This comment is purely based on service quality.I returned here three years later, hoping to visit the bar I used to like.Wow, it's shocked.The lady who took us in was very angry because I asked if there was a Taiwan -flavored cocktail.She said, ""This is a American bar."" Using her super strong Eastern European sound emphasized American characteristics.Looking around .. This is definitely not a ""American"" bar because it is not a sports bar.I told her that I lived in the United States, and then she began to say anything else, because frankly, she seemed to just fly from Russia.Sadly, the service is bad.Wait half an hour before getting a check.She didn't even come over.We had to walk to the bar and pay.Thanks to God, they did not ask Americans to give tip, haha.No longer.I walked to the corner ""Bar Without"".High -quality services and delicious cocktails make everything better!",False
"大城市中的一顆寶石

從外面看，它就像一個小商店。但推開那扇門，你就進入了一家整潔舒適的酒吧。這家酒吧最令人印象深刻的部分是它的菜單免費。您描述您喜歡的東西、口味或風格，調酒師就會為您調製飲品！這就像是為客戶量身訂製的即興飲品。

我們說我們想要一些濃烈、清爽、辛辣的東西。很快一杯飲料就來了，就是這樣。這種飲料味道清爽，但實際上很烈。對於辛辣的部分，調酒師添加了西拉差。我以為它會很重，但實際上嘗起來非常清淡和光滑。

我們的第二杯飲料是貝里尼和莫吉託的組合。不過我覺得太甜了。我們令人愉快的調酒師堅持要他調製一杯新飲料，因為他們希望確保每杯飲料都能滿足客人的期望。

總之，我喜歡這個超級友善的酒吧。我立刻就與調酒師產生了聯繫，我知道我會回來接受更多的地下酒吧治療。","A gem in a big city

Ounce 是我在台北最喜歡的酒吧之一。每次回台灣都會來Ounce喝一杯。這裡的調酒師非常友善，並且了解如何為像我這樣的威士忌愛好者調製一杯美味的威士忌飲料。它就像一個秘密酒吧，你將從右手邊的「牆」門進入酒吧。空間不大，但是氣氛很適合一個人或三五好友一起去。強烈推薦而且一定要去。乾杯!,"Once is one of my favorite bars in Taipei.Every time I return to Taiwan, I will come to OUNCE for a drink.The bartender here is very friendly and knows how to prepare a delicious glass of whiskey drink for whiskey like me.It is like a secret bar, you will enter the bar from the ""wall"" door on the right side.The space is not large, but the atmosphere is very suitable for a person or three or five friends to go together.Strongly recommend and must go.cheers!",False

Finally sitting down, waiting is worth it.This is a warm and comfortable place with rustic walls, leather seats and New York -style cocktails.There is no menu here, and the bartender will customize drinks according to your preference.A great drink, a good place for dating.

我是在 Google 和 Yelp 上看到 Ounce 的推薦後來到這裡的。服務、氣氛和飲料都沒有讓人失望。我只希望我有更多的時間在這裡成為常客，因為我只在城裡待了一個星期。一定會回來。如果我在台北的時間只夠去一家酒吧，那就是這裡了,"I came here after I saw Once and Yelp's recommendation on Google and Yelp.None of the service, atmosphere and drinks are disappointing.I just hope that I have more time to be a frequent visitor here because I only stay in the city for a week.Will definitely come back.If my time in Taipei is only enough to go to a bar, that's it here",False

對於講英語的外籍人士來說，這是最好的地下酒吧之一，可以感受昏暗房間的平靜、舒緩的舒適感、友善的調酒師服務、輕柔的爵士樂和專為您的口味調製的高品質雞尾酒。

中國當地人也絕對應該來，無論是與朋友/約會對像一起享受舒適無噪音的飲品空間，還是在與世界各地美妙的地下酒吧相似的氛圍中探索優質雞尾酒（會說英語很有幫助，但也有中文）工作人員也會說話，所以不用擔心）。

如果您想要絕對的安靜和保證的座位，最好在晚上 9 點之前到達。九點多，人潮開始湧入。

調酒師會為您調製您想要的東西（沒有菜單），並確保您得到的是您想要的東西。如果不是，他們會堅持免費為您重新調製飲料。

酒吧經理之一阿什（Ash）是一位來自法國的好心人，他遊歷過世界各地，英語說得很好。我有幸在工作日的一個清晨與他就生活中的一些事情進行了愉快的交談。

他友善的服務讓我感覺就像回到了家，一邊喝著我點的熱蘋果酒一邊慶祝冬天。他對這種飲料的了解值得他們要價。感謝他，我學會了一些新的雞尾酒，再次添加到我個人的必喝清單中。

在我去過的台灣所有酒吧中，如果假期裡再有一次喝酒的機會，我會再次光顧這家酒吧。

如果健康和時間允許的話，我還會再來的。

謝謝阿什和工作人員！","In short: Good snack choices (there are few choices, but quality is still good).Come here, in the atmosphere of a calm and comfortable underground bar, taste the delicious drinks prepared by the knowledgeable bartender.

Long:

For foreigners who speak English, this is one of the best underground bars. You can feel the calmness, soothing comfort in the dim room, the friendly bartender service, the gentle jazz music, and the high preparation for your taste. Quality cocktail.

Locals in China should definitely come. Whether it is a drinking room for comfortable and noise, or to explore high -quality cocktails in the atmosphere similar to the beautiful underground bars around the world (it is helpful to speak English, but it is helpful, but There are also Chinese) staff can also speak, so don't worry).

If you want absolute quiet and guaranteed seats, it is best to arrive before 9 pm.At more than nine o'clock, the crowd began to flow in.

The bartender will prepare you what you want (no menu) and make sure you get what you want.If not, they will insist on recharging drinks for free.

One of the bar manager Ash is a kind person from France. He has traveled all over the world and speaks well in English.I was fortunate to have a pleasant conversation with some things in his life in the early morning on working days.

His friendly service made me feel like returning home, celebrating the winter while drinking the hot apple wine I ordered.His understanding of this drink is worth their asking price.Thanks to him, I learned some new cocktails and added it to my personal must -drink list again.

Among all bars I have been to, if there is another chance to drink during the holidays, I will visit this bar again.

If health and time permit, I will come again.

Thank you Ash and the staff!",False
可愛的地下酒吧，調酒師非常熱情。店面很容易讓人誤解，因為你根本聽不到街上的音樂。可能不太容易找到，但只要問問坐在門口的傢伙就可以了。喜歡“無選單”設定:),"The cute underground bar, the bartender is very enthusiastic.The store is easy to misunderstand, because you can't hear the music on the street at all.It may not be easy to find, but just ask the guy sitting at the door.Like the ""menu -free"" settings :)",False
隱藏在咖啡/飲料櫃檯後面的涼爽地下酒吧。工作人員非常友好，飲料很美味而且很濃！好的氛圍。也提供少量食品，包括烤起司。非常適合 2 或 3 人的小團體，較大的團體可能會很困難。我們大約 8:30 提前到達並立即就座。當我們 9:30 左右離開時，這個地方已經滿了。,"The cool underground bar hidden behind the coffee/drink counter.The staff is very friendly, the drink is delicious and strong!A good atmosphere.A small amount of food, including baking cheese.It is very suitable for small groups with 2 or 3 people, and large groups may be difficult.We arrived in advance at about 8:30 and take a seat immediately.When we left around 9:30, this place was full.",False
入口很酷，裡面有時髦的氛圍，但飲料不是很好！儘管他們的心在正確的地方，但他們需要繼續嘗試所有的口味。飲料還可以，沒有耀斑或裝飾以使它們更漂亮。不過服務還是不錯的。,"The entrance is cool, there is a fashionable atmosphere inside, but the drink is not very good!Although their hearts are in the right place, they need to continue trying all the taste.Drinks are okay, without spots or decoration to make them more beautiful.But the service is good.",False
"我一個人去的，不過是個老人嗎？這位女士非常友好，飲料很美味，我們度過了一段輕鬆的時光。
店內光線昏暗，氣氛沉穩。

這是一個隱蔽的酒吧。

我認為這是一個可以用於多種目的的酒吧，無論是獨自一人，與朋友一起，還是約會。

I think this is a bar that can be used for multiple purposes. Whether it is alone, with friends, or dating.

前面偽裝成咖啡吧。詢問咖啡師，他會帶路。沒有菜單，所以告訴調酒師你想喝什麼。雞尾酒肯定是一流的。您將獲得非常有趣的體驗。咖啡吧實際上正在煮咖啡，所以你出去的時候可以醒酒。,"Pretend to be coffee in front.Ask the barista, he will lead the way.There is no menu, so tell the bartender what you want to drink.Cocktails are definitely first -class.You will get a very interesting experience.Coffee bar is actually coffee, so you can wake up when you go out.",False

"我十月訪問了盎司，當時正值一場颱風。當我們到達時，由於即將到來的暴風雨，酒吧裡空無一人——事實上，Ounce 是少數幾個在暴風雨期間開放的酒吧之一。

入口隱藏在顯眼的地方：走近那家看起來像店面的小咖啡店，要求喝一杯雞尾酒。您將被引導穿過一扇凹進的門進入酒吧。黑暗的酒吧舒適而私密，酒吧裡的座位不超過六個，整個酒吧有五到六張桌子。

沒有菜單：您將依靠工作人員來幫助您挑選飲料。與我們互動的每個人都很樂意提出建議並提出問題，以確定什麼是適合我口味的令人愉悅的飲料。我的第一杯雞尾酒是一杯很棒的卡爾瓦多斯拉莫斯（Calvados Ramos），第二杯則是一杯美味的澄清牛奶潘趣酒。

特別感謝烤起司——我在台北最喜歡的酒吧食物！這裡是小團體、情侶甚至是單獨出去玩的好地方。工作人員英語說得很好，提供多種烈酒。","I visited the ounce in October, when a typhoon was at that time.When we arrived, due to the upcoming storm, there was no one in the bar -in fact, OUNCE was one of the few bars that were opened during the storm.

我們是一大群人，每人被要求喝兩杯，我們並不介意。不過，飲料上來的速度非常慢，所以我們最終停留的時間比我們想要的要長，大部分只是等待。飲料還可以，但很基本。大多只是經典加上「扭曲」成分。沒有菜單是相當困難的。,"We are a large group of people, and each person is asked to drink two glasses, and we don't mind.However, the speed of drinking is very slow, so we finally stay longer than what we want, most of which are just waiting.The drink is okay, but it is very basic.Most of them are only classic plus ""twist"" ingredients.It is quite difficult to have no menu.",False
在這裡喝酒度過了一段美好的時光。酒吧工作人員既友好又知識淵博，無論是雞尾酒還是世界各地的酒吧。他們製作的雞尾酒的曲折和經典的品質給我留下了深刻的印象。希望我有更多的時間再次造訪這座城市！,"Drinking here has a good time.Bar staff are both friendly and well -known, whether cocktails or bars around the world.The twists and turns they made and the classic quality of them left a deep impression on me.I hope I have more time to visit the city again!",False

在推薦下我和三個朋友去了很棒的地下酒吧。  我很不幸地打翻了我的飲料，儘管這是我的錯，但沒有收費。我們這一頓雞尾酒NT400元一杯，啤酒NT250元一杯。我的《黑暗與暴風雨》加上一些額外的香料非常棒。  目前，最後入場時間為晚上 10 點，酒吧於晚上 11 點關閉。,"Under the recommendation of three friends, I went to a great underground bar.I unfortunately overturned my drink.

一家很棒的地下酒吧，沒有飲料菜單，也不接受預訂。我們當晚的調酒師莫里斯是我們遇到過的最好的雞尾酒調製者和調酒師。在聽了我們的喜好和不同的要求後，他調製的每一種雞尾酒都是 10/10——連續 6 種，每一種都非常美味，而且每次都不同。他也是最高效的調酒師，主動為我們服務，並立即為我們和酒吧的其他人調製出夢想的雞尾酒。非常有效率。所有的工作人員都很友好和細心，也提供一些小吃。等不及要回去了。,"A great underground bar, no drink menu, no reservation.Our bartender that night was the best cocktail modem and bartender we have encountered.After listening to our preferences and different requirements, each cocktail he prepared is 10/10 — a continuous 6 consecutive, each of which is very delicious, and each time is different.He is also the most efficient bartender who takes the initiative to serve us and immediately prepare the cocktail for us and the others.Very efficient.All staff are friendly and careful, and also provide some snacks.Can't wait to go back.",False

Speakeasy 雞尾酒吧的概念很棒——沒有菜單，沒有服務。您的訂單由服務員負責解釋您的飲品「風格」。我的飲料很不錯，但我的同伴則不太好——這可能是由於語言障礙。氣氛恰到好處，不太吵或擁擠。絕對會推薦不同的雞尾酒體驗,"The concept of Speakeasy Chicken Tail Bar is great -no menu, no service.Your order is responsible for explaining your ""style"" of your drink.My drink is very good, but my companion is not very good -this may be due to language barriers.The atmosphere is just right, not too noisy or crowded.I definitely recommend different cocktail experiences",False
很棒的飲料，可愛的員工和美妙的音樂。還能問什麼呢？我刪除了之前的 3 星評論，因為酒吧現在有了新的酒吧經理，在重新訪問後，我認為服務和飲料值得 5 星。  酒吧仍然溫馨舒適——幹得好，盎司！,"Great drinks, cute employees and wonderful music.What else can I ask?I deleted the previous 3 -star comment, because the bar now has a new bar manager.

第二次回到這裡，仍然是我在台北最喜歡的雞尾酒吧。酒吧服務生會說英語，而且很友善。沒有菜單，所以你需要告訴調酒師你喜歡什麼。第一杯飲料他給了我一些更傳統的飲料，在和我們交談了一段時間後，他做了第二杯更具冒險精神的飲料，我很喜歡！此外，飲料很濃，但味道並不難聞。好地方,"The second time I returned here, it was still my favorite cocktail bar in Taipei.Bar waiters will speak English and are very friendly.There is no menu, so you need to tell the bartender what you like.He gave me some more traditional drinks in the first drink.

幾年前去慶祝我的生日，晚上 11 點左右到達。我們一邊考慮要點什麼雞尾酒，一邊點了第一輪酒。 10 分鐘後我們點了雞尾酒。又過了15分鐘，我們還沒有收到飲料，所以我們讓服務員查看進度。傲慢的法國調酒師來到我們的餐桌旁，告訴我們最後的訂單已經被叫了，他不會為我們製作那些訂購的雞尾酒，儘管服務員很高興地接受了我們的訂單，而且我們沒有人知道最後的訂單。總的來說，生日非常令人失望，不會再回來了。懷念亞當羅賓遜的日子。,"A few years ago to celebrate my birthday and arrived around 11 pm.As we consider what cocktails, we ordered the first round of wine.After 10 minutes, we ordered the cocktail.After 15 minutes, we haven't received the drink yet, so we let the waiter check the progress.The arrogant French bartender came to our table and told us that the final order had been called. He would not make the cocktails ordered for us. Although the waiter was glad to accept our orders, and no one we knew The final order.Overall, birthday is very disappointing and will not return anymore.Miss the days of Adam Robinson.",False
在假牆後面，您會發現盎司的黑暗而涼爽的世界。雞尾酒品質一流，氣氛也一流。如果您提出要求，友善的調酒師將為您調製一杯客製化飲品。這是一個向朋友展示或約會台北休閒/高檔一面的好地方。,"Behind the fake wall, you will find the dark and cool world of ounces.Cocktails are first -rate and the atmosphere is first -class.If you make a request, a friendly bartender will prepare a customized drink for you.This is a good place to show or dating Taipei Leisure/High -end.",False
不錯的隱藏酒吧，門面是便利商店。當然有舒適的感覺和不受干擾的飲酒。不提供菜單，但工作人員非常樂於助人，英語和普通話都很流利。強烈推薦給那些想在台北嘗試不同的東西的人。,"A good hidden bar, the facade is a convenience store.Of course, there is a comfortable feeling and drinking uninteresting drinking.The menu is not provided, but the staff is very helpful, and English and Mandarin are fluent.Strongly recommend those who want to try different things in Taipei.",False
我和我的朋友在街上的露臺桌子上喝了一杯啤酒（200 元台幣）。  我們對從側門出來的人感到困惑，直到我們需要回收啤酒並使用廁所。很酷的地下酒吧，聚集著“大都市”的混合人群。  廁所很有趣：三角形的拉門，鏡子讓蠟燭看起來像一個圓形。  約會的好地方！,"My friend and I drank a glass of beer on the terrace on the street (200 yuan).We are confused about the people who come out of the side door until we need to recycle beer and use toilets.The cool underground bar gathers a mixed crowd of ""metropolis"".The toilet is very interesting: the triangular sliding door, the mirror makes the candle look like a round.A good place to date!",False
我最喜歡喝一杯冷飲的地方。沒有菜單，而且我還沒有對訂單感到失望。舒適私密的環境，「隱藏」的入口增添了神秘感和趣味感。如果您是雞尾酒愛好者，一定要來看看。,"I like to drink a glass of cold drinks the most.There is no menu, and I have not disappointed the order.A comfortable and private environment, the entrance of ""hidden"" adds mystery and interest.If you are a cocktail enthusiast, you must take a look.",False

4.5顆星！非常舒適和親密，有一扇隱藏的門。調酒師非常友好並且願意進行良好的交談。她推薦了很棒的飲料！試試內格羅尼！這讓我很驚訝。我老婆也玩得很開心。,"4.5 stars!Very comfortable and intimate, there is a hidden door.The bartender is very friendly and willing to talk well.She recommended a great drink!Try Negrani!This surprised me.My wife also played happily.",False
"很棒的地方，有西方調酒師和工作人員，因為有紐約的附屬機構。他們會根據你的喜好為你訂製飲料。黑暗溫馨的氛圍。

台北排名第一的雞尾酒。每杯飲料約 13 美元。入口是一扇隱藏的門，旁邊是淺牆/商店類型的地方。如果找不到，請四處詢問。他們說英語。精心調製的雞尾酒，採用高品質原料、新鮮水果、可客製化且令人難以置信的美味。無愧於亞洲 TOP50 BAR 稱號。,"The number one cocktail in Taipei.About $ 13 per cup.The entrance is a hidden door, next to the shallow wall/store type.If you can't find it, please inquire.They speak English.The carefully prepared cocktails use high -quality raw materials, fresh fruits, customized and incredible deliciousness.Worthy of the title of TOP50 BAR in Asia.",False
"地點與原來的咖啡店有所不同。門現在位於小路邊欄的右側

"首先，飲料很一般。

作為一個隱藏的酒吧很放鬆。超越了它執行良好的噱頭，擁有優秀、熟練且隨和的員工。我的三人點了四種不同的雞尾酒，菜單上和菜單外都有，每種都很完美。也是涼爽空間的道具。,"It is very relaxed as a hidden bar.It surpasses its good gimmick and has excellent, skilled and easy -going employees.My three ordered four different cocktails, on the menu and the menu, each of which was perfect.It is also a cool space prop.",False

街上沒有這家酒吧的標誌，也沒有任何痕跡。這是隱藏在休閒咖啡館內的時尚樂趣。所有的工作人員都是白人，還有一名 ABC 門衛，他們會回應你的敲門，並檢查你是否足夠時髦，可以加入人群。飲料最多是平庸的曼哈頓時尚酒吧的價格標籤。調酒師有一臉壯觀的鬍鬚，讓你想起自己彷彿置身於銀湖的時髦潛水中。總而言之，我花了大約 30 美元買了兩杯水飲料，但我很喜歡這裡涼爽的氣氛。,"There is no sign of this bar on the street, and there are no traces.This is the fashion fun hidden in the casual cafe.All staff are white, and there is an ABC gatekeeper who responds to your knocking and check whether you are fashionable enough to join the crowd.Drinks at most are the price label of the mediocre Manhattian fashion bar.The bartender has a spectacular beard, which reminds you of the fashionable diving of yourself in Silver Lake.All in all, I spent about $ 30 to buy two glasses of water drinks, but I like the cool atmosphere here.",False

這個酒吧太酷了。有點難找，前面偽裝成一個小型的、露天的街邊咖啡館。飲料價格約為 400 新台幣（約 13 美元），無需提供實際菜單，您只需告訴他們您喜歡什麼，他們就會為您調製特色飲料。它可能看起來很貴，但絕對值得。,"This bar is so cool.It's a bit difficult to find, pretending to be a small, open -air street cafe.The price of drinks is about NT $ 400 (about 13 US dollars). There is no need to provide actual menu. You only need to tell them what you like, and they will prepare special drinks for you.It may look expensive, but it is definitely worth it.",False

秘密勢利酒吧，適合尋找台灣女孩的外國人或想與外國人交往並表現得很酷的當地人。對於地下酒吧來說，飲料高於平均水平，但這種體驗在台北幾乎是獨一無二的，所以我給它很高的評價,"The secret and powerful bar, suitable for foreigners who are looking for girls in Taiwanese or people who want to associate with foreigners and show cool locals.For the underground bar, the drink is higher than the average level, but this experience is almost unique in Taipei, so I give it a high evaluation",False
一種隱藏的說話容易。我們讓調酒師來提供雞尾酒，我們並沒有失望。那種薄荷冰鎮酒類型的混合物讓人“哇！”。一拳打在你臉上。很酷的氛圍。,"A hidden speech is easy.We asked the bartender to provide cocktails, and we were not disappointed.The mint of mint ice -type mixture makes people ""wow!"".Punch on your face.A cool atmosphere.",False
