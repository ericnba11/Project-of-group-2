"🌟CP值超高！物美價廉！絕對願意再訪！🌟

我是6/22晚上，在南港附近吃了另一家居酒屋，太貴又沒吃飽，才又找來這間店的。

整間店沒有另作清楚隔間， 有作木板稍微隔開區別包廂位置，麻雀雖小，但基本都有做到位，冷氣機是落地式 靠近最內部角落，廁所我沒去，所以廁所整潔我不評論。
不過是南港超老宅老區改裝，能做到這樣已經不容易。

門口設有吸煙區（擺放煙灰缸）
請不要亂丟煙蒂！

初進店的時候，店員三位各忙各的，招呼店員感覺有點漫不經心，我還幫自己喊了聲「呀洗媽些～」搞怪一下，入座後有跟店員表明「是第一次來，剛剛有在別間先吃過一輪了，沒吃飽，但也沒那麼餓」，瞭解到這邊店的風格比較沒那麼制式化，跟客人的相處方式就好比朋友一般，不會客套，相對下來也讓整間店給人更容易放鬆自在！

第一輪點餐，因單價都非常親民，所以放肆的點，也怕點太多，店員也有告知先這樣就好，不然吃不完。酒類在冰箱自取，杯子跟店員問。

第二輪點餐是另一位店員，也是有告知我們別點太多😂超可愛的

然後我在門口抽煙，聽到其他客人有點「明太子厚蛋燒」，問後得知類似「玉子燒」一份好像120$，馬上又加點😂

一瓶大瓶18天 ，印象中130/瓶

最後結帳 四人 共 1890，我就跟店員說算1900吧！

硬要說美中不足的點⋯
就是冷氣太冷了，我可能坐在出風口，但也可以忍受，就沒跟店員反應，或者可以適時調一下冷氣出風位置？
點餐完後，可以先出一張總單，讓客人知道自己點了什麼，什麼餐漏單，上完餐可請上餐店員劃掉，最後結帳比較不會有爭議。
（我是覺得這麼好吃，四人也才1900，有什麼好計較，但避免遇到神經病客人，店家也可保護自己）

謝謝店家店員的優質餐飲、服務風格，食物都很好吃！希望串居留可以嚐嚐久久！給五顆星，餐點、服務、風格也滿分，真的是實至名歸！","！CP value is super high!Masterpiece is cheap!Absolutely willing to visit again!Bleak

In the evening of the 6/22, I ate another izakaya near Nangang. I was too expensive and not full. Then I found this shop again.

The entire store does not make another clear compartments. There are wooden boards that are slightly separated from the box position. Although the sparrows are small, they basically do it. The air -conditioner is close to the inner corner. No comment.
However, it is not easy to achieve this.

There is a smoking area at the door (placed ashtray)
Please don't litter the cigarette butt!

When I first entered the store, the three clerks were busy, and greeted the clerk a little careless. I also helped myself shouting, ""Yeah, Mom ~"" I was funny. I just ate a round of the first round. I didn't eat it, but I was not so hungry. ""I learned that the style of the store here is less formalized. Relative to make the whole store easier to relax!

In the first round of ordering, because the unit price is very close to the people, the order is too much, and there are too many ordering. The clerk also told that it would be good first, otherwise you can't finish eating.The wine is taken in the refrigerator, and the cup is asked to ask the clerk.

The second round of ordering is another clerk, and I also told us not to order too much.

Then I smoked at the door, and heard that other guests were a bit ""Burning Prince Her Egg Burning"". After asking, I learned that it seemed like ""Yizi Burning"".

A large bottle for 18 days, 130/bottle in the impression

Finally, there were 1890 four people at the end of the checkout, so I told the clerk to count 1900!

Instead of saying the shortcomings of beauty ...
That is, the air conditioner is too cold. I may sit at the air outlet, but I can tolerate it. I did n’t respond to the clerk, or I can adjust the air -conditioned air in a timely manner?
After ordering the meal, you can give a total list first to let the guests know what they ordered, what meals, and the meal can be asked to check out. The final checkout will not be controversial.
(I think it is so delicious, and the four are only 1900. What are the good calculations?

"最近南港很厲害，美食沙漠再這樣下去都快變綠洲了!今天來到「串居留居酒屋」是個鮮為人知的深夜食堂，所以推廣一下這家讓人放鬆又滿足的居酒屋。

不知道從甚麼時候開始?南港的居酒屋開了好多間，幾年前，跟家姐在南港找個地方吃消夜是件困難的事情，往往是豆漿店與鹹酥雞，而現在，我們居然還有了一點點的選擇，來滿足我們在夜深人靜的舌尖饗宴。

因為吃的很滿足，歪嘴雞想來談談，在雞哥的心中如何才是完美的深夜食堂。

1. 從來不用排隊叫號碼，更不用人齊才可入座，臨時朋友來也沒問題。
2. 除了吃，還要談，聊天甚至比吃東西更重要，如果有喝酒更好。
3. 食客沒有固定要吃什麼，老闆也沒有固定要煮什麼，客人完全相信老闆。這種店，多半會成為獨特的個性小店。
4. 客人不一定真的肚子餓才到來，更多時候，是心靈飢餓，要找人陪，所以氛圍也是很重要的環節，價格可以高一些，但氛圍一定得舒服放鬆。

總體來說，「串居留居酒屋」都能符合以上，今天吃的很開心!

臨走之際，不忘跟老闆稱讚了餐點美味，那天心情很好，一次很放鬆的夜消體驗。","Recently, Nangang is very powerful, and the food desert will change the oasis like this! Today, coming to ""String Hostel House"" is a little -known late -night cafeteria.

I do n’t know when it started? Nangang ’s izakaya has opened a lot. A few years ago, it was difficult to find a place with her sister to find a place in Nangang. It is often a soymilk shop and a salty crispy chicken. Now, we are actually still still. With a little choice to satisfy our quiet tongue feast at night.

Because I was very satisfied, the crooked chicken wanted to talk about how to talk about the perfect late -night cafeteria in the heart of the chicken brother.

1. There is no need to queue in line to call numbers, let alone people can take seats, and temporary friends are okay.
2. In addition to eating, you have to talk about it. Chatting is even more important than eating. It is better if you have drinking.
3. The diners are not fixed to eat, and the boss has nothing to cook. The guests completely believe in the boss.Most of these stores will become unique personalized shops.
4. Guests may not be really hungry before they come. More often, they are hungry in their souls. They are to find someone to accompany them. Therefore, the atmosphere is also very important. The price can be higher, but the atmosphere must be comfortable and relaxed.

Overall, ""Striped Residence and House"" can be in line with the above, and I am very happy today!

"小編我雖然不敢說我是專業的居酒屋食客

但是整個雙北縣市也吃過不少家

大街小巷寧可錯殺也不放過

中南街之前我有介紹過一間居酒屋🏮

沒想到對面也開了一間

一直沒機會嘗試看看

剛好我愛的那家打烊了

當然就退而求其次來拓荒看看

如鷹眼般的我當下就看出這間店的端倪

不只裝潢！擺設！冰箱配置！座位區的設計

都跟台北市著名的一間居酒屋🏮很像

這間雖然我還沒寫過！

它被偶像劇～發揚光大！

沒錯就是（竹村）

（竹村）給我的印象就是重口味的串燒

每串的大小都比一般串燒店大支

好！重點當然不是竹村

是串居留！！🏮

剛開始上了兩碗味增湯！

當下喝了一口！

我以為我來到了大海～鹹阿！

當下反應過後！服務生馬上就換了兩碗

而且變招待（湯有點雷，海帶芽好硬）當下也不想再反應！

畢竟還是有點其他的菜！

來拓荒就是要有冒險的精神

接下來上了日式沙拉！

果然跟竹村一樣！但是當下沒有問！

但是生菜部份可能冰太久！口感不太好！

份量部分也比較少！（小雷）

點了四支牛五花肉串也上了

還好醬汁還行！不然牙口不好的人！可能無法吞嚥

也點了照燒雞腿x2

沒想到！雞腿烤的偏乾！雞腿肉能表現如此

可見師傅的烤工有待加強

當然當下忍不住問了店員！是否跟竹村有關聯

當下也回答我說是竹村老闆開的

也解答了我心中疑惑！

以下是我心中的OOXX

1：如果要創立新品牌！為何沒有新奇感

2：如果是copy其它兩間分店的菜色！
為何一樣東西！落差感如此巨大！

3：一間沒有生啤酒機的居酒屋也不多了

4：服務上只是送餐到桌上！也無時刻注意客人狀況！還收了10%服務費？

5：如果這間店只是來練烤工！是否可以出師後再出菜⋯

當然我的標準停留在竹村

畢竟它是間需要排隊的店！

給兩顆星實在殘忍！三顆星的評價希望可以進步

可能我不是酒客！品嚐食材的味覺可能比較高

以上純屬個人口味

當然也有可能是一間品質不一的店家！

試試吧！希望可以進步！","Editor I do not dare to say my professional izakaya diners

Not only installing!Furnishings!Refrigerator configuration!The seating area design

It is like a famous izakaya🏮 in Taipei City

New Kyo One although I wrote it!

It was idol drama ~ promoted big!

Just a skewer!!🏮

Drinking a mouthful!

I thought I came to the sea ~ salty!

And become entertaining (soup is a bit thunder, kelp sprouts very hard) At the moment also not want to react again!

After all, a little other dish!

Coming to the desolation is to have a spirit of adventure

Next up to Japanese Salad!

As it turns out, the same as Bamboo Village!But there is a question at the moment!

But the lettuce part may be too long!It's not too good!

The portion part is also relatively small!(Small Thunder)

The skewers are also up to the four beef skewers

Fortunately, the sauce is still!Uncontinence tooth mouth is not good!It may be unable to swallow

Also ordering the grilled chicken legs x 2

Want to want to want!Chicken legs are dry!Chicken legs can perform this way

It can be seen that the roasting work of the master needs to be strengthened

Of course, ask the clerk in the moment!No whether or not to relate to Chuk Village

At the moment, I also answered me that the owner of Zhuzhu Village opened

Also answering questions in my heart!

The following is OOXX in my heart

1: To create a new brand!Why is there a novelty

2: If the other two other branches of tweaks are dishes!
Why is it something!It's so huge!

3: A stalk of raw beer machines is not much

4: On service only delivered to the table!There is no moment to pay attention to the customer's condition!Also charged 10% service?

5: If the shop only comes to practice roasting!You can not leave the dish after the master...

Of course I dwell in Bamboo Village

After all, it needs to queue at the store!

結果居然開出館長玉米筍XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

整體來說我算是賺了一盤玉米筍（？）不過也表示真的是產地直送，很新鮮很好吃，但就是有點太幽默哈哈哈！

As a result, the corn bamboo shoots of the museum XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

On the whole, I made a plate of corn bamboo shoots (?) But I also said that it was really direct delivery. It was fresh and delicious, but it was a bit humorous hahaha!

我來這裡只是為了看照片，因為它讓我想起了，即使我來了韓國，我也想再去一次！
因為我來自韓國，所以很感謝他們播放韓語歌曲並幫我搭計程車😍😍
下次去台灣一定要再去一次😀😀","I used to eat it when I went to Taiwan before, and it was delicious.
I came here just to see the photos, because it reminds me of it. Even if I came to South Korea, I would like to go again!

有些餐點是日式的，有些則是台灣日式的，但整體來說是個很好的體驗。我們特別喜歡茄子和蘑菇，也喜歡蔥牛肉捲。工作人員非常樂於助人，提供了菜單上的推薦和無可挑剔的時機,"Some meals are Japanese -style, and some are Taiwanese Japanese -style, but it is a good experience overall.We especially like eggplant and mushrooms, and onion and beef rolls.The staff is very willing to help others, and provides the recommendation and impeccable timing on the menu",False,0.215,0.0,0.785,0.9097
"開幕當週來吃就一試成主顧，本來不愛燒烤的我硬是被這邊的新鮮食材和舒服的氛圍吸引！跟老闆閒聊後才知道老闆以前是「竹村」的當家大廚，論CP值、服務、食材都是一流！
PS. 週末若人多記得先訂位～","I tried to take a trial of the Lord in the beginning of the week. I did n’t like the barbecue. I was attracted by the fresh ingredients and a comfortable atmosphere here!After chatting with the boss, I learned that the boss was the chef of ""Zhucun"".
