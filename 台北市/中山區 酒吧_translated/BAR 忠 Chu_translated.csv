"那個布丁超神，上面的焦糖吃了直接升天，愛死🫶🏻
bar忠最厲害的是他的調酒都很柔和，但層次依舊，重點是會口齒留香，他可以殘留在口中的味道很久，我真的完全被圈粉了❤️
這裡就是台北最強的特調店，而且是現場shake不是預調的","That pudding super god, the caramel on the top eaten directly to the sky, love to die 🫶🏻
The most powerful thing in Bar is that his bartender is soft, but the level is still, the focus is on the fragrance of teeth. He can stay in the mouth for a long time.
This is the strongest special store in Taipei, and it is not a pre -adjustment on the site."
此家調酒以水果見長，小餐點也相當別緻，很少有酒吧會使用大量的食用花裝飾於餐點上，可見老闆的浪漫個性～調酒非常好喝，氣氛非常安靜，可以悠閒的慢慢品飲。,"This house is seen with fruit, and the small meal is quite chic. There are few bars decorated with a large amount of edible flowers on the meal. It can be seen that the boss’s romantic personality ~ The bartender is very delicious, the atmosphere is very quiet, you can leisurely, you can leisurely, you can leisurely. Slowly drink."
"水果系列調酒好喝，但個人認為餐點過於普通，等同於餐點價位過高

老闆身兼調酒師出酒與出餐點，忙進忙出，感覺很難顧到全面，但願封他為酒吧界的洪金寶，很靈活

希望老闆未來能訓練起夥伴製作餐點，能更專注於調酒。","The fruit series is delicious, but I personally think that the meal is too ordinary, which is equivalent to the high price of meals

The boss is also a bartender to produce wine and meals, and he is busy with it. It feels difficult to take care of the comprehensive. I hope he is very flexible as Hong Jinbao in the bar industry.

I hope that the boss will train partners to make meals in the future and be more focused on bartending."

"Bar 忠 Chu 是間提供美味餐食與高水準調酒的日式酒吧。位於新生高架旁，從捷運中山國小站4號出口出來，步行約3分鐘左右可以抵達。日式酒吧通常為了營造出安靜舒適的品酒環境，一般都會有些入店的規範。而Bar 忠 Chu 特別強調不接受只用餐不喝酒的客人，個人猜測大概是過去有太多慕名美食前來的客人（笑）

店內環境氛圍相當輕鬆，長長的L型木製吧台，暖色系的燈光，穿著白色西裝的老闆與笑容可掬的服務生小姐姐時不時來回穿梭於吧台與廚房之間。老闆一人身兼廚師與調酒師，服務生小姐姐則負責招呼客人與出餐。

當天調酒依序點了：蜜柑Dry Gin、Gin Martini、養命酒Negroni、大稻埕Negroni、Sidecar、Espresso Martini、Smoky Manhattan；餐點的部份則是：無花果鴨胸、生火腿馬鈴薯沙拉、炸牡蠣。每一樣的外觀與滋味都相當豐富精彩。服務生小姐姐問我最喜歡哪一杯調酒，我頓時語塞。實在是因為每杯的水準都很高，一時很難可以分出高下，只能往細節裡鑽。

蜜柑Dry Gin：這杯是當天顏值最高的。淡淡的花香氣味，口感上是琴酒的草本與檸檬味覺調性，值得一提的是香茅與蜜柑出奇地搭，我是第一次嘗試這樣的組合。搭配著相同是酸甜滋味的無花果鴨胸，相當舒適。

Gin Martini：老闆選用的基酒是No 3 London Dry Gin。口感圓潤，杜松子氣味明顯，伴隨著有層次的辛香料與溫潤的柑橘氣息。搭配鹹香的橄欖，口感更溫柔，也更乾爽。

養命酒Negroni：有別於一般版本的Negroni，多了股木質基調飽滿特性的沉穩內斂。讓我想起個人也很喜歡，同樣也是以木質基調為主軸的Bar 小谷 White Negroni。這邊我點來搭配的是生火腿馬鈴薯沙拉，木質基調的苦甜調酒，配上鹹香爽口的馬鈴薯沙拉，別有一番風味。

大稻埕Negroni：在點第一杯的時候，隨口問了老闆這杯大稻埕的味道。老闆說有加薄荷，喝起來是外國人第一次去大稻埕的感覺，有點難解釋。純粹是想知道到底是什麼樣的感覺，就點來喝喝看。搭配著灑了梅粉的焦糖櫻桃番茄，果然有種在迪化街逛南北貨的感覺（笑）

Sidecar：酸甜相當平衡，白蘭地的韻味伴隨柔和的柑橘果香，入喉後帶點微微木質與辛香料的味覺刺激。這時實驗性地點了炸牡蠣來搭配，牡蠣本人鮮美飽滿，酸香的醬汁與牡蠣的鮮味完美融合。個人覺得這酸味會使得Sidecar明顯過酸，不過搭配著炸牡蠣的配菜漬蘋果，反而使得這杯Sidecar更加果香奔放。

Espresso Martini：個人本來一向偏好以白蘭地作為基酒的版本，但當天卻也被老闆這杯伏特加版本的給收服了。喝起來清爽卻也不失濃郁的咖啡底蘊，加了Cointreau也多了柑橘的果香氣味。風味層次也因此延展活絡了起來。

Smoky Manhattan：本該在上一杯Espresso Martini就該是個句點了。再加點這杯純粹是酒鬼性格作祟。喝到好喝的調酒，在能力（酒量）許可下就會想一直點（大誤）這杯帶著煙燻風味的Manhattan相當溫柔，威士忌的酒香，滑順的口感，搭配著櫻桃與招待的松露腰果，完美地劃下當晚的休止符。","Bar Zhong Chu is a Japanese -style bar providing delicious meals and high -level bartending.Located next to the elevated elevated, exported from the MRT Zhongshan Elementary School Station, and you can arrive in about 3 minutes.In order to create a quiet and comfortable wine tasting environment in Japanese -style bars, there are generally some regulations for entering the store.And Bar Zhong Chu particularly emphasized that guests who do not accept meals and do not drink. Personally, I guess it is probably the guests who came in the past (laugh)

The environment atmosphere in the store is quite relaxed. The long L -shaped wooden bar, warm -colored lights, boss wearing white suits and a smiley waiter, from time to time, shuttle between the bar and the kitchen from time to time.The boss is also a chef and a bartender, and the waiter is responsible for greeting guests and meals.

The bartender was orderly on the day: Mitan Gin, Gin Martini, NEGRONI NEGRONI, Dadaocheng Negroni, Sidecar, ESPRESSO MARTINI, Smoky Manhattan; Fried oysters.Each appearance and taste are quite exciting.The waiter asked me which cup of bartender I like most, and I suddenly said.It is because the standard of each cup is very high, it is difficult to divide it at a time, and can only drill into the details.

Mitan Dry Gin: This cup is the highest on the day.The faint smell of floral aroma, the taste of the piano wine and lemon taste, it is worth mentioning that lemongrass and mandarin are surprisingly set up. I tried such a combination for the first time.It is quite comfortable with the same sweet and sour fig duck breast.

Gin Martini: The base wine selected by the boss is NO 3 London Dry Gin.The taste is round, and the smell of Du Songzi is obvious, accompanied by layered spices and warm citrus atmosphere.With salty olives, the taste is more gentle and dry.

NEGRONI: Unlike the general version of Negroni, the full and restraint of the full characteristics of the wood quality is calm and restrained.It reminds me of personal favorite, and Bar Komagaya, who is based on wooden tone as the main axis.I like to match the raw ham potato salad, the bitter sweet tone of the wooden tone, and the salty and refreshing potato salad, don't have a flavor.

Dadaocheng Negroni: At the first cup, I asked the boss the taste of the Dadaocheng.The boss said that there was mint, and it was the first time that foreigners felt like to go to Dadaocheng, which was a bit difficult to explain.I just want to know what it feels like, just click to drink.With caramel cherry tomatoes sprinkled with plum powder, it really feels like shopping on Dihua Street (laughs)

Sidecar: Sweet and sour is quite balanced. The charm of Bailan is accompanied by a soft citrus fruity aroma. After entering the throat, it has a little wood and spices.At this time, fried oysters are matched with experimental places. The oysters themselves are delicious and full. The sour sauce is perfectly fused with the umami taste of the oyster.Personally, I think this sour taste will make Sidecar obviously too sour, but with the side dishes with fried oysters, it makes this cup of Sidecar more fruitful.

Espresso Martini: Individuals have always preferred the version of Bailan Di as a base wine, but it was also conquered by the boss's cup of Vodka that day.It tastes refreshing but without losing the rich coffee heritage, adding Cointreau also has more citrus fruity smell.The level of flavor has also been extended.

Smoky Manhattan: It should have been a period in the last glass of Espresso Martini.Add this cup to this cup purely.After drinking delicious bartending, you will want to order (big mistakes) under the ability (wine volume) permit. This cup with smoky Manhattan is quite gentle. The hospitable truffle cashews are perfectly scratched by the rest of the night."

"這是一間打從我第一次耳聞就相當有興趣的店
不為什麼，就憑「只接受當天訂位」這件事
在現今，各式各樣預約困難，甚至需要耗費人脈的店如雨後春筍般冒出
如此的一間店，從還未踏入店家就能讓人感到放鬆❤️

店內有老闆的明文規定，價錢亦是。
踏進一間店前，若對於以上不認同，您大可不必進入。
如若依然決定前往，請尊重。

老闆的用心都在他的菜單上
請看完菜單，再來發問，過程中有沒理解過來的語意，服務員也都會耐心解釋

當天我是一人前去
因時間還很早，整間店僅有我一個人
奈何中午吃得太飽，沒辦法吃鹹食，只能直接點酒
總共點了四杯：
🍇麝香葡萄
🍸石榴果金白蘭地
🍊金柑柚子薑
🍸無花果葡萄柚

每一杯都好喝的不得了😍
最讓我驚艷的莫過於「金柑柚子薑」
口味層次調和的非常完美！
入口的香氣，直至最後的尾韻，讓人念念不忘❤️

店內氛圍清幽、放鬆
老闆和服務員都非常可愛
會注意客人的一舉一動
但不是讓人不舒服直勾勾盯著你的那種
印象很深刻當時因為有蚊子咬我
老闆知道後，馬上放下手邊的事
拿出可以驅趕蚊子的噴霧（沒有任何味道）
非常有效，蚊子馬上暈頭轉向掉下來

還有一些不經意間的小互動、笑聲
並不會刻意聊天，也不會指高氣昂
那天本想坐到很晚喝完12個口味🤣
結果有事只能先回家
離開前老闆告訴我下個月草莓大約會來的時間
歡迎我再度前去
聽到後我馬上問資訊都發在哪裡 FB嗎
老闆表示在IG
當下我毫不猶豫馬上追蹤他們的IG
（而我從來不追蹤任何一間店的IG）

這間店，就是讓我這麼喜歡。
老闆很帥，服務員很可愛❤️
下次再去必須空腹去吃熟食！","This is a shop that I was very interested in the first time I heard from me
Why not, just rely on the ""only reservation on the day""
Nowadays, all kinds of appointments are difficult and even needed.
Such a store can make people feel relaxed from entering the store. ❤️

There is a clearly stipulated by the boss in the store, as well as the price.
Before entering a store, if you don't agree with the above, you don't have to enter.
If you still decide to go, please respect.

The boss's intentions are on his menu
Please read the menu and ask questions again. In the process, there is no understanding of the semantics, and the waiter will explain patiently

I went alone that day
Because the time is still very early, the whole store is only me alone
However, I can eat too much at noon, I can’t eat salty food, I can only order it directly
A total of four cups:
🍇 musk grape
地 🍸 🍸 🍸 🍸 🍸
🍊 🍊 🍊 🍊 Grapefruit ginger
柚 Fruit Fruit Grapefruit

Every cup is so delicious 😍
The most amazing is ""Golden Mandarin Grapefruit Ginger""
The taste hierarchy is perfect!
The aroma of the entrance, until the final rhyme, makes people miss ❤️

The atmosphere in the store is quiet and relaxed
Both bosses and waiters are very cute
Will pay attention to the guest's every move
But it's not uncomfortable to stare at you
I was very impressive at the time because there were mosquitoes bite me
After the boss knows, put down the matter at hand immediately
Take out the spray that can drive the mosquito (no taste)
Very effective, mosquito immediately fainted and turned down

There are also some inadvertent small interactions and laughter
I don’t have a deliberate chat, nor does it refer to high gas
I wanted to sit up late that day and drank 12 flavors 🤣
As a result, you can only go home first
Before leaving, the boss told me the time for the strawberry next month
Welcome me to go again
After I heard it, I immediately asked where the information was sent?
The boss said in IG
I don't hesitate to track their IG immediately
(And I never track the IG of any store)

This shop just makes me like it so much.
The boss is very handsome, the waiter is cute ❤️
Next time you have to eat cooked food on an empty stomach!"
"酒的價格比較高（600以上為主）但是選擇蠻特別的，很多結合水果的酒可以選擇！我蠻喜歡百香果接骨木花這杯，百香果上面有火燒的糖，脆脆的，像布雷一樣的糖片，很好喝！但是價格真的偏高，所以當天過去客人偏少。
餐食配酒的表現還算不錯，但是比想像的驚豔稍弱，招待的小食很好吃！喜歡😘","The price of wine is relatively high (mainly 600 or more) but the choice is quite special. Many wines that combine fruits can be selected!I like the cup of bone flowers of Passion Fruit. There is a burning sugar on the passion fruit, crispy, sugar tablets like Brey, which is delicious!But the price is really high, so there were fewer guests in the past.
The performance of meals and wine is pretty good, but it is slightly weaker than imagined, and the hospitable snacks are delicious!Like"
氣氛很好，安靜適合好好說話，老闆調的酒好好喝，店內以新鮮水果酒為特色，同時老闆自己的特色調酒也很棒，品嚐時讓人有和老闆「同步創作意境」的fu，咖啡凍也非常好吃真材料，吃的到老闆的用❤️製作每一樣餐點和酒品，會讓人一直想去，有種老地方相聚的fu👍,"The atmosphere is very good, quiet and suitable for talking well, the boss's wine is good, the shop is characterized by fresh fruit wine, and the boss's own specialty bartender is also great. When tasting, people have a FU that ""synchronizes the artistic conception"" with the boss. Coffee frozen is also very delicious. Eat the boss's use ❤️ Make every meal and wine products, which will always make people want to go."
"這間日式酒吧餐酒館，我好喜歡，居然就在我常去的8%ice cafe旁邊，經過100次也沒發。
調酒比較偏妹，但很好喝，年輕女生的客人也不少，料理像是升級版的日式家常，沒有花俏，卻簡單暖胃。","I like this Japanese -style bar and tavern tavern. I really like it. I actually went next to the 8%ICE CAFE I often went. After 100 times, I did not send it.
The bartending is more sisters, but it is delicious. There are many young girls. The cooking is like an upgraded version of the Japanese -style family. It is not fancy, but it is simple to warm the stomach."
酒還行，但價格高到不值得，不是不好喝，只是不值一杯 $700 的價值，有些當季水果製成的調酒價位 $900。店內不大，很多日本客人，氛圍還可以。,"The wine is okay, but the price is not worth it. It is not bad, but it is not worth a cup of $ 700. Some seasonal fruits are $ 900.The store is not large, and many Japanese guests have an atmosphere."
在台灣沒喝過比bar忠chu好喝的水果調酒！從五年多前開始陸續也喝了十次有，見證了通貨膨脹⋯價格上漲了不少，也從最初的日籍老闆親自調酒到現在主要由老闆的徒弟（？）調酒，而老闆負責餐點部分。但即使如此，每隔幾個月還是會想再訪！而每次再訪都能喝到當季水果的新鮮特調！希望能再喝個十年二十年☺️,"I haven't drank in Taiwan that is more delicious than Bar Zhong Chu.I have been drinking ten times a few times before more than five years ago. I have witnessed inflation. The price has risen a lot. From the original Japanese boss personally, I am alcohol in person to the current apprentice of the boss (?) Responsible for the meal part.But even so, you still want to visit again every few months!And every time you visit, you can drink the fresh special adjustment of the season!Hope to drink another ten years and twenty years ☺️"
"【食在台北：BAR 忠 Chu 】

終於有空拜訪工作室對面聽說很厲害的 BAR 忠。

雖然近在咫尺，但只有晚餐時間營業，我總是在講課或諮詢。昨天晚上終於抽出兩小時，拜訪朋友口中的「超強日式下酒菜」bar。

大概是太多人想來吃飯了，BAR 忠的低消是一杯調酒。

水果調酒是他們家的特色，很水果，把整顆日本進口的哈密瓜、草莓、蜜柑…等不同水果打成泥加進調酒。

我們點了草莓VODKA和蜜柑伯爵茶調酒。

看著那些又大又甜的日本進口草莓被做成調酒，超級奢華！喝起來也很棒哦～

餐點嘗試了起司拼盤、芥末章魚冷盤、香菜檸檬炸雞、肉醬千層麵、起司蛋糕。

確實是蠻好吃的！

後來為了配炸雞，又加點一杯柚子梅酒，心滿意足的晚餐❤️","[Eat in Taipei: Bar Zhong Chu]

Finally, I visited the opposite side of the studio and heard that BAR loyal was very powerful.

Although it is close at hand, I am always talking or consulting with only dinner time.I finally took two hours last night and visited the ""super Japanese wine dish"" BAR in the mouth of my friends.

Probably too many people want to come to eat, Bar Zhong's low consumption is a glass of bartending.

Fruit alcohol is a characteristic of their family. It is very fruit. Different fruits such as cantaloupe, strawberry, mandarin, etc. imported from Japan are made into mud into mud and bartender.

We ordered the strawberry Vodka and Earl Mandarin Tea.

Looking at the big and sweet Japanese imported strawberries were made into bartender, super luxurious!It's great to drink ~

I tried the cheese platter, the bearded octopus cold dish, the coriander lemon fried chicken, the thousands of meat sauce, and the cheese cake.

It's really delicious!

Later, in order to match the fried chicken, add a glass of grapefruit plum wine, satisfied dinner ❤️"

酒的種類不少，也可以跟老闆討論喜好，請老闆介紹，甚至有無酒精飲品，還有餐食，選擇很多。點了調酒，驚為天人，超好喝的！聽說調酒都是使用100%的果汁調製，價格高也是理所當然。一杯還沒喝完就想著下次要再訪了。

接受刷卡，僅接受當天訂位。","I was introduced by a friend to know this Japanese -style bar.The boss is Japanese. The bar is not large, but the style is very good, and the music is also very tasteful.Each person eliminates 800 yuan+15%service fee. Be sure to order drinks. No guests driving or cycling are not welcome to emphasize not to drive after drinking.
There are many types of wine, you can also discuss your preferences with your boss.

新鮮日本水果調酒，搭配酒餐風味獨特，日本老闆風趣有禮，很喜歡每個週末到此小酌一番！非常有質感的酒吧！謝謝老闆招待喜歡的威士忌🥃 …,"Fresh Japanese fruit alcohol, with a unique flavor of the meal, the Japanese boss is funny and polite. I like to drink it here every weekend!Very textured bar!Thank you boss for entertaining your favorite whiskey ..."

"經營者扇野 忠和先生（又稱Chu桑、Kazy桑）具有深厚的餐飲資歷，既具料理天賦亦擅長調酒。味覺敏銳，擅長將水果融入調酒中，創造獨樹一格的水果特調。

早期總是一人獨挑大樑、忙進忙出，熟客們90%為日籍，每每去喝酒，耳邊此起彼落皆日語交談，大家彼此也都很有默契，愉悅地聊著天耐心等候老闆調酒或是烹調。現在比較多是台灣顧客，規矩也訂較多（不接受2人以上團體、不接受電話訂位、不接待僅用餐以及開車前來的客人）雖多了其他店員幫忙，但忙的時候還是需要等待一下。

Chu桑每天一早必定前往濱江市場採買當季時令的新鮮水果及海鮮。餐點部分以和風洋食為主，菜單不定期更換，如：蟹肉可樂餅、奶油鯷魚馬鈴薯塊、海膽料理、紅酒燉豚肉、漢堡排、章魚沙拉、蛋包飯、明太子義大利麵、莫札瑞拉起司酪梨龍蝦、生蠔⋯等等，道道份量與美味兼具！

但別忘了本質終究是以酒吧為主，並不提供食物外帶，且只想單純用餐的話建議前往別處，這裡是服務酒客的地方😊","Mr. Fano Toyo (also known as Chu Sang and Kazy Sang) has deep dining qualifications, which has both the talent and bartender.The taste is keen, and is good at incorporating the fruits into the bartender to create a unique fruit.

In the early days, I always picked up the beams alone, and I was busy. 90%of the mature guests were Japanese. Every time I went to drink, they talked in Japanese in their ears. Everyone also had a tacit understanding. Blooming or cooking.Now there are many customers in Taiwan, and there are more rules (do not accept groups of more than 2 people, do not accept telephone reservations, do not receive guests, but only dine, and drive from driving.

終於造訪了 #bar忠chu，放在口袋名單好久好久了。餐點完全超乎期待，#海膽明太子義大利麵 滿滿的海味奔放（麵條硬度簡直完美）、#香菜檸檬山椒炸雞 的風味層次優雅清爽（炸粉到底是哪家的，超優），開胃先來一杯 #柚子Mojido，真的是畢生喝過最誠意十足的一杯，薄荷葉香氣濃郁又不發苦、搭配檸檬清爽酸味恰到好處。餐後當然要來杯必喝的招牌水果調酒，我選了 #日本晴王麝香葡萄 調酒，優雅淡爽的甜味搭配濃郁的果膠口感，很神奇的一杯調酒，我真的非常享受每一口淡淡拓漫在舌尖味蕾的葡萄甜味。,"Finally visited the #bar Zhong Chu, and put it on the pocket list for a long time.The meal is completely beyond expectations. First, a cup of#先 Mojido is really the most sincere cup of life. The mint leaves have a strong aroma without bitterness, and the lemon refreshing sour taste is just right.Of course, after the meal, I have to drink the sake of alcohol that must be drinking. I chose#, elegant and light sweetness with a strong pectin taste, a magical glass of bartending, I really enjoyed very much enjoyment Each bite of grapes with a faint flavor buds of the tongue."
"好可愛又真日式的酒吧
有很多的材料是真真實實的來自日本

像是我們點的第一杯
哈密瓜白蘭地
用了來自日本的哈密瓜
和軒尼斯的白蘭地
真的是香甜中的香甜
果香外還加上白蘭地的葡萄香
真的很棒

另一杯是新鮮草莓的調酒
當然也是來自日本的草莓
甜甜中帶一點酸
是草莓自有的酸氣
加上裝飾的三色堇整體很搭
而且酒好平衡順口

當然因為用了日本的水果和好的材料
酒的單價都偏高一點
但一分錢 一分貨很正常的

這兒低消一人八百
所有消費還另加15%哦
有附熱毛巾和小點心

這邊的食物好像也很強下次再來試試","So cute and real -Japanese bar
There are many materials that are true from Japan

Like the first cup we ordered
Cantaloupe Bailan
Use cantaloupe from Japan
And Bailan in Hennis
It's really sweet in sweetness
Fruit aroma also adds the grape fragrance of Bailan Di
It's great

The other cup is a fresh strawberry bartender
Of course, strawberries from Japan
Sweet and sour
It's strawberry's own sourness
Coupled with the decorative three -color 体 加 加 加 加 加
And the wine is good and balanced

Of course
The unit price of wine is higher
But it is normal for a penny and one penny to goods

Here is a low and one person, one person 800
All consumption also adds 15%more
There are hot towels and snacks

The food here seems to be very strong next time I will try again next time"
水果調酒很厲害 👍🏻 食物也是其他地方沒吃過的料理手法方式 有推,Fruit alcohol is very powerful 物 Food is also a cooking method that has never been eaten elsewhere.
"水果調酒好好喝，夏天的玉荷包調酒超讚，濃郁的荔枝香氣，太好喝一下就shot掉
柚子金桔是我近期新歡，酸酸甜甜尾韻帶點溫和辛辣感，大稻埕也很特別且好喝，最後一定點一杯最愛的紫蘇調酒做結尾","Fruit alcohol is good, the summer jade purse is superb, the strong lychee aroma, too delicious, should be dropped when it is too delicious.
Grapefruit kumquats are my new love recently. Sour sour and sweet tail rhyme with a mild and spicy feeling, Dadaocheng is also very special and delicious. Finally, you must order a cup of favorite perilla bartending"
整體氛圍輕鬆舒服，香菜檸檬炸雞菜品有水準，招待草莓與起司簡單卻不失格調。點了招牌水果調酒（晴王葡萄）有點失望，水果香氣十足可惜沒有酒感，但這其實是偏好，也是店家的取向。感受上價位偏高。,"The overall atmosphere is easy and comfortable. Coriander lemon fried chicken dishes are standard. The entertaining strawberry and cheese are simple but style.It was a bit disappointed after ordering the signature fruit alcohol (Qingwang Grape). Unfortunately, the fruits have no wine, but this is actually a preference and the orientation of the store.Feel the high price."
"我最愛的酒吧❤️
當季水果特調必點～
哈密瓜、蓮霧、釋迦、草莓、百香果、火龍果中，
我最愛的是蓮霧調酒😍😍😍

忠桑很有自己的堅持✊
日式酒吧多半是希望客人低調交談不互相打擾，
所以忠bar只開放給兩人以下入店，
且不接受預約（通常七點開店都會有位置）
（大約八九點之後才會有較多客人）
店內裝潢簡單乾淨，位置大約只能容納16位
洗手間有很貼心的配備（香味噴霧與女性生理用品）
音樂多為翻唱的英文老歌🎵
適合喜歡安靜的人來用餐與享受調酒的地方！","My favorite bar ❤️
The seasonal fruits are specially ordered ~
Cantaloupe, lotus fog, Shakya, strawberry, passion fruit, dragon fruit,
My favorite is the lotus fog alcohol 是

Zhong Sang has his own persistence 有
Most Japanese -style bars want guests to talk low -key and not disturb each other.
So Zhong Bar is only open to the store below two people,
And do not accept the appointment (usually there will be a location at 7 o'clock)
(There will be more guests after about eight or nine o'clock)
The interior decoration of the store is simple and clean, and the location can only accommodate 16 bits
There are very intimate equipment (fragrance spray and female physiological supplies)
Music is mostly covered English old songs 🎵
Suitable for people who like quietness to eat and enjoy bartending!"
"調酒跟食物都非常美味
味覺搭配的衝突 層次 都滿點
同伴直說逼米其林星級

很喜歡老闆的cool 跟用心","Blooming and food are very delicious
The level of conflict matching of taste is full
The companion said that Michelin star

I really like the boss's COOL and attentive"
"一家氣氛很好的日式Bar，室內偏安靜。
一人低消800+15%服務費，每人要點一杯飲品。
服務人員也會很有耐心地介紹菜單～

水果調酒非常厲害！
點了一杯🍈哈密瓜x grasshopper
超級好喝！算是喝過數一數二好喝的調酒
口味偏甜，有一點creamy的感覺 超級順口 🙌

點心、漬物、料理也都不錯吃，但感覺最厲害的是水果調酒！","A Japanese -style BAR with a good atmosphere, the room is quiet.
One person eliminates 800+15%service fee, and each person has a drink.
The service staff will also patiently introduce the menu ~

Fruit alcohol is very powerful!
Ordered a cup of cantaloupe X Grasshopper
Super delicious!I have been drinking a few delicious bartender
The taste is sweet, and a little creamy feels super smooth 🙌

Dim ""Dim Sum, stains, and dishes are also good, but the most powerful thing is fruit alcohol!"
"氣氛超好，低消好像700，很容易點到
裡面蠻暗的，全日式風格
店內空間不是很大，大概只有10來個位子
位子要先打電話預訂比較保險

酒保真的是日本人
我覺得酒的口味蠻特別
像我點的有點像打碎的蘋果泥配氣泡酒
不喜歡泥狀的要三思

真的是讓人很推薦的一家 Bar！","The atmosphere is super good, it seems to be 700 low, it is easy to click
It's darker inside, full -Japanese style
The space in the store is not very large, there are only about 10 digits
The seat must first call and book more insurance

Jiu Bao is really Japanese
I think the taste of wine is quite special
Like me like a bit like a broken apple mud with bubble wine
Think twice if you don't like mud

It is really a recommended BAR!"
"點了我自己的定番酒，作為評比的標準來說，是我在台灣喝過最好喝的！
但非常可惜，台灣的客人習慣要點餐，每一桌都在吃飯，像是把這裡當餐廳，整間都是飯菜的味道，並且主人不得不一直在廚房裡忙著，不太能站在吧台後面，殊為可惜！","Once my own Dingfan wine, as the criterion for evaluation, it is the best I have drank in Taiwan!
But it is a pity that the guests in Taiwan are used to ordering meals. Each table is eating. It seems to be the taste of meals as a restaurant. The owner has to be busy in the kitchen. It is a pity later!"
"環境昏暗舒適，服務人員親切會幫忙介紹
店家有一些小細節相當貼心，例如寒冷冬夜一坐下就送上熱的擦手巾；衛生紙是過敏人專用日本才買得到的柔軟衛生紙；廁所內有洗手乳和護手霜

菜單不能拍照，但餐點可以，低消是一人800元加10%服務費
酒類售價大多為500起跳，種類繁多，可以請店員幫忙介紹
店家最有名的各式水果酒則是600起跳，用高級的新鮮水果製作，很值得一試！
餐點部分則是300起跳，但很多都是500.600以上的價位(破千的也不少喔

哈蜜瓜酒是用半顆哈蜜瓜加三種基酒，如果覺得酒味太濃可以把果肉挖下來，用果汁稀釋酒味，因為哈蜜瓜非常非常甜，這道就像甜點一般，很讓人喜愛啊

蜜桃酒是用新鮮蜜桃做的，每一口都是濃厚蜜桃香，也很推薦","The environment is dim and comfortable, and the service staff will help you introduce
There are some small details in the store that are quite intimate. For example, when the cold winter night is sitting down, it will send the hot hand scarf; toilet paper is a soft toilet paper that is only available in Japan for allergic people; hand -washing milk and hand cream in the toilet

The menu cannot be taken, but the meal is okay. The low consumption is 800 yuan per person plus 10%service fee
Most of the alcohol prices are 500 jumps, and there are many types. You can ask the clerk to help introduce
The most famous fruit wine in the store is 600 jumps. It is worth trying with high -level fresh fruits!
The meal part is 300, but many of them are prices above 500.600 (there are a lot of breaking a thousand

Honeydel wine is used with half a Honey melon and three types of basic wine. If the taste of the wine is too strong, you can dug the flesh and dilute the wine with the juice, because the Honeydel is very very sweet, which is like a dessert. Very love

Peach wine is made of fresh peaches. Each bite is strong peach fragrance."
氣氛很棒的日式酒吧，只接兩個人以下的客人，琴酒系列很多也很好喝，水果酒也很正，但就是有點高單價，要考慮一下,"The Japanese -style bar with a great atmosphere, only the guests of less than two people, many of the piano wine series are also very delicious, fruit wine is also very positive, but it is a bit high unit price. Consider it."
除了新鮮水果調酒之外，經典調酒也很值得嘗試，水準穩定、功力扎實。哈密瓜白蘭地可以先放一下，等哈密瓜充分吸收白蘭地再吃，味道融合得更好。餐點口味也都在水準之上，不過配菜都是一樣口味的沙拉，醬料有芥末會微辣。廁所備品非常齊全，很貼心。,"In addition to fresh fruit alcohol, classic bartending is also worth trying, with stable standards and solid skills.Can put it first in the Hammer Bailan, and wait for the cantaloupe to fully absorb Bailan to eat, and the taste is better.The taste of the meal is also above the standard, but the side dishes are the same flavored salad, and the sauce will be slightly spicy.The toilet reserve is very complete and intimate."
"這是一間你來了絕對會後悔的店
花錢還要受氣的地方
四人用餐1500 寫超小的字
而且我們沒有用餐只有喝酒
也要按照用餐的抵消
有種被詐騙的感覺
店員堅持說老闆有請我們看不懂中文的朋友去看規則 但店員也沒有對客人詳細說明
我們沒看清楚或看不懂 都是客人的問題
老闆還說 因為你們四個人坐了位置 他沒辦法接其他組客人有七個人 位置不夠沒辦法接客人都是我們造成的感覺 真的對不起老闆也因為我們沒辦法讓店裏接大客戶們
沒有提供實質的服務例如 介紹菜單等等 還要收15% 一切都是來消費的客人的錯

帶外國朋友來這間店真的是最失敗的決定

If you don’t read Chinese words, be careful coming to this bar. The minimum purchasing requirement weren’t written in English. And it goes up if you have more ppl coming and only written in small words that’s unable to be aware.

The drink was alright, not as impressive. The service needed to be improved.  You are paying extra 15% service fee for basically no service.

I’m sorry with this experience I will never come back again nor introducing to friends.","This is a shop that you will definitely regret when you are here
Where to spend money and get angry
Four people eat 1500 to write super small words
And we have no meals but only drink
Also offset according to the meal
There is a feeling of being fraudulent
The clerk insisted that the boss had friends who asked us not to understand Chinese to see the rules, but the clerk did not explain in detail to the guests
We didn’t see it clearly or could not understand it.
The boss also said that because the four of you were sitting, he couldn't pick up other groups of guests. There were seven people in the position of seven people who did not have enough positions and could not pick up the guests. We felt sorry for the boss.
No substantial service, such as the introduction menu, etc. 15%, and everything is the fault of the guests who come to consume

It is really the most failed decision to bring foreign friends to this shop

If you do n’t read Chinese words, be careful coming to this bar. Ing and only written in small word that ’s unable to be aware.

The drink was alright, not as impressionive. The Service Needed to be Improved. You are paying extra 15% service fee for basical no service.

I ’m sorry with this excelience I will never come back apor introducing to friends."
"最喜歡的bar。
很適合一個人安靜、輕鬆的喝杯酒，短暫放空休息一下。
謝謝老闆的堅持以及每次的招待！","Favorite Bar.
It is very suitable for a person to drink a glass of wine quietly and relaxed, and take a short break.
Thank you boss for your persistence and every hospitality!"
"非常高級的餐酒館
店主對於食物非常講究
東西都是好吃的
不過就是太貴了一點
個人觀感酒並沒有到這麼高的價錢","Very advanced dining tavern
The owner is very particular about food
Things are delicious
But it's just a bit more expensive
Personal view wine is not at such a high price"
"扇野忠和Chu桑來台9年後自立門戶

坐位不多，放著Jazz的音樂，氣氛悠閒，適合上班族或怕吵的大叔

廚房的油煙味過重以外，因為可以在室內抽煙、雪茄，怕煙味的人千萬別去

日本原汁原味的專業酒吧，很利害的調酒，尤其是用高級的新鮮水果去調，台灣比較少見，食物也有一定的水準 $$$😍","Fan Yezhong and Chu Sang Laitai set up their own portal 9 years later

There are not many sitting positions, with Jazz’s music, leisurely atmosphere, suitable for office workers or uncle who are afraid of noisy

In addition to the heavy smell of oil smoke in the kitchen, because people who can smoke indoors, cigars, people who are afraid of smoke, don’t go

Japan's original professional bar, very interesting bartending, especially using high -level fresh fruits to adjust, Taiwan is relatively rare, and food has a certain level."
很多調酒是用高級的日本水果製作，點了枇杷梅酒及草莓調酒，味道很好，適合我這種喜歡水果且酒味不要太重的人。因爲水果的比例很高，價格較高也是可以接受的。店內也有酒體較重的酒，如果在意的話最好點之前先問過。,"Many bartending is made of high -grade Japanese fruits. I ordered plum wine and strawberry bartending. It tastes good. It is suitable for people like me who like fruits and do not have too heavy wine.Because the proportion of fruits is high, the price is highly acceptable.There are also heavy wines in the store."
"整體環境相當日式且優雅
是一個可以非常寧靜品酒及享用美食的酒吧
水果系列調酒都是真材實料相當用心精緻","The overall environment is quite Japanese and elegant
It is a bar that can be very peaceful and enjoy food

"很棒的酒吧！最喜歡這種可以安靜喝酒的地方了~門口有寫一些關於這家店的規矩需要大家配合~東西好吃酒也好喝
所以的一切都是美味與賣相兼具，愛了愛了","A great bar!I like this place where you can drink quietly ~ There are some rules about this store at the door that requires everyone to cooperate with everyone ~ It ’s delicious and delicious.
So everything is delicious and selling."
經典調酒為主，普通正常的味道，也有一些特調，不過個人不喜歡，食物的部分也是由調酒師製作，所以如果點調酒又點食物的話會等比較久，低消800元是信義區的價格,"Classic bartending is the main special taste. There are also some special tunes, but I do n’t like it. Price of Xinyi District"
餐點和酒都有一定水準，做得很細緻，但還是覺得價位有點太高了～,"The meals and wine have a certain level, and they are very detailed, but I still feel that the price is a bit too high ~"
"店裡整體營造的氣氛很好
味道有股淡淡的香味
音樂有種昭和感
有種回到日本的感覺
調酒、食物跟服務都很棒
值得推薦","The atmosphere created as a whole in the store is very good
The taste has a faint fragrance
Music has a sense of Showa
There is a feeling of returning to Japan
Blooming, food and service are great
Worth recommending"
布丁超級好吃~~~我吃過最好吃的  ❤️,Pudding is super delicious ~~~ I have eaten the best ❤️
"一人抵銷800元，特色是新鮮水果的調酒，單價略高，一杯調酒均價在500元上下，是好喝的。
環境安靜輕鬆舒服不吵雜。","One person is sold for 800 yuan, which is characterized by the bartending of fresh fruits. The unit price is slightly higher. The average price of a cup of bartender is around 500 yuan, which is delicious.
The environment is quiet, relaxed, comfortable."
只有吧台位，調酒經典中規中矩，但特調類的有點可怕，小扣分一下，但是食物非常好！因為食物跟酒跟一位製作，所以等待時間都蠻久的，不適合沒耐性的朋友！,只有吧台位，調酒經典中規中矩，但特調類的有點可怕，小扣分一下，但是食物非常好！因為食物跟酒跟一位製作，所以等待時間都蠻久的，不適合沒耐性的朋友！
定價比較高但真的是此生喝過最好喝的水果調酒，服務也很好，店內客人也不會太多太吵，很放鬆,"The pricing is relatively high, but it is really the best fruit and alcohol that I have drank in this life. The service is also very good. The guests in the store will not be too noisy."
"友友生日小聚

布丁美味🍮","Friends birthday gathering

水果調酒是招牌，食物超讚，愛店之一,"Fruit alcohol is a signboard, the food is superb, and one of the love shops"
蓮霧tequila 、哈密瓜martini、香蕉sour的都好好喝👍🏻,"Lotus Mist Tequila, Hantarin Martini, Banana Sour"
日本籍調酒師活用新鮮水果做成水果特色調酒,Japanese bartender uses fresh fruits to make fruit special bartender
是朋友帶我來的日式酒吧，有人數上限限制。低消800，一杯酒均價600。所以大致上客單價過千。點了最有名的水果酒，覺得CP值普通。不過朋友覺得他的蓮霧酒很特別。,"It is a Japanese -style bar that a friend brought me. There is a limit on the number of people.The average price of a cup of wine is 600.Therefore, the unit price is generally over a thousand.I ordered the most famous fruit wine and think the CP value is ordinary.But my friend thinks his lotus fogy wine is very special."
炸雞非常好吃！也很推薦水果調酒，是個氣氛舒適、值得收藏為口袋清單的好酒吧,Fried chicken is very delicious!It is also recommended for fruit alcohol. It is a good bar that is comfortable and worth collecting as a pocket list.
抹茶調酒很推 餐點也很有水準 會二訪的店～,Matcha bartendants are very pushing meals and very standardized shops ~
"很棒的日式酒吧
已經第二次拜訪
日本籍的調酒師很精準跟精緻
現場附有新鮮的當季水果可以挑選
也能直接說想要什麼樣的基酒來調製
食物也非常好吃
不適合過度喧嘩的地方
我覺得整體非常輕鬆舒服","Great Japanese -style bar
Has been visited for the second time
Japanese bartender is very accurate and exquisite
Fresh season fruit can be selected at the scene
You can also say what kind of base wine you want to modulate
Food is also very delicious
Not suitable for excessive noise
I think the whole is very easy and comfortable"
"我來說一下我喝的感想
本來就知道這家店消費比在一級信義區酒吧來的高（低消800元）
滿心期待的走進去可能真的太期待有所感受不同
我點的是無花果為主的水果調酒（基本500up)
喝起來很特別 但是也沒有特別驚喜及強烈
畢竟它的價錢偏高 酒的比例也不高
另外點了一杯whiskey純飲 bartender推薦
喝起來太普通 不小心上網google了一下
意外發現這支酒折合台幣不到1300元
但我用了450 元品嚐 1oz
店內沒有什麼裝潢 是典型日本酒吧
可能因為語言不通 bartender 比較照顧日本來的朋友 也顯得我們格格不入
另外加點等很久的薯條 很好吃就是了
雖然離我家不到五分鐘的距離 但再訪機率不高","Let me talk about my feelings
I originally knew that this store consumption was higher than the Bar in the first -level Xinyi District (800 yuan low)
I look forward to walking in, maybe I really look forward to it. I feel differently
I ordered the fruits -based fruit alcohol (basically 500up)
Drinking is very special, but there is no particular surprise and strong
After all, the proportion of its high price is not high
In addition, I ordered a glass of Whiskey pure drink Bartender recommendation
Drink too ordinary, accidentally go online Google
I accidentally discovered that this wine was equivalent to less than 1300 yuan
But I used 450 yuan to taste 1OZ
There is no decoration in the store is a typical Japanese bar
Maybe because the language is not connected to Bartender to take care of Japanese friends, we also seem to be incompatible
In addition, add a little waiting for a long time to taste delicious
Although less than five minutes away from my house, the probability of re -visits is not high"
"招牌哈密瓜及草莓季特調
喜歡水果調酒的人不可錯過之處","Signature cantaloupe and strawberry season special adjustment

完美，台北最愛的酒吧，食物美味，酒特別，水果調酒都是用日本空運來台的新鮮水果。老闆親切，雖然中文不好，還是盡力講解，服務人員也會在一進門告知該店規定及消費，不能遵守的客人何必消費？,"Perfect, Taipei's favorite bar, delicious food, special wine, fruit alcohol is fresh fruits that use Japanese air to Taiwan.The boss is kind.

這裡是我最喜愛的bar，來這邊很多年了，第一次也被日本師傅的規矩多給嚇到，並被一句”不要問為什麼”而不知所以然。然而，多來了幾次，我越來越欣賞師傅的原則與堅持。我認為人與人最重要的互相尊重，你尊重店家的規矩，自然沒有人會來為難你。在這邊，我可以喝到新鮮頂級的水果酒，聽著放鬆舒服的音樂，而且師傅很常更換menu，跟一堆萬年不變的店家完全不同！這就是這裡迷人的地方啊！大家都懂得店家的規矩，就能在一個熟悉的環境度過愉快的時光。我很喜歡這裡，不要問為什麼：p,"This is my favorite BAR. I have been here for many years. For the first time, I was scared by the rules of the Japanese master, and I was ""don't ask why"" and I don't know why.However, after a few more times, I more and more appreciate the principles and persistence of the master.I think the most important respect for people and people. If you respect the rules of the store, no one will embarrass you.Here, I can drink fresh top fruit wine, listen to relaxed and comfortable music, and the master often changes Menu, which is completely different from a bunch of unchanged shops!This is the charming place here!Everyone knows the rules of the store and can spend a pleasant time in a familiar environment.I like it very much, don't ask why: P: P"
"好喝 也有創意

美中不足的是價位非常高 即便是用比較好的酒 一杯水果調酒台幣750-850的價位是偏高的 比很多紐約、新加坡和香港的日式酒吧還貴

規矩非常多 但店家有入座時說明 不過我的確是看隔壁桌很倒霉一直惹到店家","It's also creative

The disadvantage is that the price is very high, even if the price of 750-850 with a better glass of wine is more expensive than many Japanese bars in New York, Singapore and Hong Kong.

There are a lot of rules, but when the store has a seat, it shows that I did see that the next table is very unlucky."
"釋迦那杯 真的沒啥平衡可言
Gin fizz  清香還行
食物好吃有餘 驚艷不足","Sakama Cup is really no balance to say at all
GIN FIZZ fragrance is okay
The food is delicious and stunning, insufficient"
店家規定要點調酒，由於開車不能喝有酒精，也沒有提供軟性飲品還不能用餐點抵，大家請慎選餐廳，服務不好、餐點份量少、衛生也很不佳，整體體驗感覺很差！ 連一顆心都不如,"The store stipulates that you must order bartending. Because you ca n’t drink alcohol when you drive, you do n’t provide a soft drink and you ca n’t get a meal. Please choose the restaurant carefully. Difference!Even a heart is not as good as"
"新鮮水果為主的調酒是主要特色。單杯主要700起跳…

服務態度很不好，女服務生講話很不客氣。或許人與人溝通不用這麼使用命令的語氣，讓消費者很不舒服。但或許因為餐廳定價高，對服務有要求，有種花錢受氣的感覺。,"The service attitude is not good, and the female waiter is very polite.Perhaps people do not need to use the command to communicate with people, making consumers uncomfortable.However, maybe because the restaurant has high pricing, it has requirements for services and feels angry."
"我純喝調酒
價格比台灣酒吧略高
味道不是很喜歡，但這很主觀
講些客觀的部分
我在吧台上看到bar tender調好倒進A杯後
可能是吧備拿錯杯子還怎樣
Bar tender直接從A杯倒進B杯
整個味道冰度都會改變吧
以這個價位有這樣的服務我覺得有待改進","I drink bartender purely
The price is slightly higher than the Taiwanese bar
The taste does not like it, but this is very subjective
Speak some objective parts
I saw Bar Tender on the bar and poured into the A cup
Maybe it ’s what if you have the wrong cup
Bar Tender poured directly from the A cup into the B cup
The whole taste will change, right?
At this price, there is such a service. I think it has to be improved"
"酒好喝，食物好吃。
是個安靜悠閒的地方，很喜歡。","The wine is delicious and the food is delicious.
It's a quiet and leisure place, I like it very much."
第一次造訪，感覺像在日本，會找時間再訪。,"For the first visit, it feels like in Japan, and I will find time to visit again."
酒與下酒菜都是台北top 10,Both wine and wine are Taipei TOP 10
新鮮水果調酒好喝👍,Fresh fruit alcohol is delicious 调
"低消偏高，一人要800塊錢，等於要2杯起跳。
裝潢不算華麗，但還算舒適。
經典調酒還算不錯，而且真的頗大杯，這樣單價算算其實沒有比較貴。
水果調酒相當優秀，可說不輸銀座的一級店。
一杯雖然要600，但考慮到進口新鮮水果的成本，其實也還好。","The low disappearance is high. One person costs 800 yuan, which is equivalent to 2 cups.
The decoration is not gorgeous, but it is comfortable.
The classic bartending is not bad, and it is really a big cup. This is not more expensive in this unit price.
Fruit alcohol is quite excellent, but it can be said that it is not lost in the first -level store.
Although a cup is 600, considering the cost of importing fresh fruits, it is actually okay."
"時間：2021/01/29（3.9）
北海道扇貝咖喱好吃，濃郁微辣，漢堡排普通，偏甜，炸雞也普通。無花果起士花很好吃。酒類的話，草莓不錯，有一款茶酒超級驚艷，兩者酒感不高。整體來說好吃，但價格實在太高，在台北可能有更好的選擇，推薦但應該近期不會二訪","Time: 2021/01/29 (3.9)
Hokkaido scallop curry is delicious, rich and slightly spicy, the burger is ordinary, sweet, and fried chicken is also ordinary.Figs and fruits cheese flowers are delicious.For wine, strawberries are good. There is a tea and wine super stunning, and the wine feels not high.Overall it is delicious, but the price is too high. There may be better choices in Taipei. It is recommended but should not visit in the near future."
一開始要點柚子文旦水果酒，吧台說沒有，過了十來分鐘另一組客人進來點一樣的就有了，雖然吧台有來說明是他們的失誤並道歉，但也僅只於此，對於一間高級酒吧來說這樣的處理方式其實頗感意外，生蠔有點腥味，明太子義大利麵還不錯，但是蒜頭炸過頭苦味太重，兩杯調酒還可以，味道稍嫌單調。,"At the beginning, I would like to order grapefruit Wendan fruit wine. For high -end bars, such treatment is actually quite surprising. The oysters are a bit fishy."
"超高檔水果使用，調酒一杯不算便宜但跟老闆的身材一樣大器，容量是一般的二杯🤣所以CP值還是超高
照片是老闆多調招待的特大顆白葡萄調酒，基酒是好喝的蘋果蒸餾琴酒Le gin, balance極佳，重點招待一小杯的量，已經別人家的一杯了阿😂 …","Used ultra -high -grade fruits, a cup of bartending is not cheap, but the same as the boss's body, the capacity is the general two cups, so the CP value is still super high
The photo is a large white grape bartender that the boss entertains more. The base wine is a delicious apple distilled piano lew gin. Balance is excellent, focusing on the amount of a small cup of entertainment."
"1.Google上的菜單圖片都跟當場吃到的不一樣
炸牡蠣只有三顆？？？？Google上面的是五顆
份量有夠少，是在塞牙縫嗎？
2.而且為什麼製作調酒要用手抓冰塊
非常的不衛生⋯","1. The menu pictures ongoogle are different from eating on the spot
There are only three fried oysters?IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionGoogle is five on top
Is there enough amount of portion, is it stuffing the teeth seam?
2. And why do you need to grab ice cubes by making bartender
Very unhygienic ..."
老闆的調酒是真功夫，本次點了麝香葡萄調酒（Gin基底）與焙茶Gin Tonic都非常滿意。服務生也絲毫不馬虎，細心介紹每樣酒品，店裡過11點後少了來用餐的人們，反而安靜舒服。很棒的地方！非常推薦！,"The bartender's bartending is a real kung fu. This time, I ordered the musk grape bartender (Gin base) and roast tea GIN TONIC.The waiter was not sloppy, and carefully introduced each wine. After 11 o'clock in the store, the people who came to dine were less and comfortable.A great place!Very recommended!"
特色水果酒很好喝，但價格也頗為高昂,"Featured fruit wine is delicious, but the price is quite high"
"食物好吃😋調酒好喝☺️非常喜歡這間酒吧的地方在於所有東西都很有品質，可以吃得出來用得原料很好，會再來訪
幾乎每個禮拜都來，菜單也是常常更換不重複，類似的品項也常常會進行微調，所以常常來也每每都被驚喜到💕 …","The food is delicious.
Almost every week, the menu is often replaced and not repeated. Similar items are often fine -tuned, so they often come and be surprised to 💕 ..."
"好喝的調酒，超好吃的料理，
超推水果系列調酒，
會想再來，一直去！！
限定，三人以下喔，
不過氛圍就是適合放空喝酒，聊點小天，
享受那安靜舒適的氛圍。","Easily bartending, super delicious dishes,
Super push fruit series bartender,
I would like to come again, go all the way!Intersection
Limited, less than three,
But the atmosphere is suitable for drinking and drinking, chatting with little sky,
Enjoy the quiet and comfortable atmosphere."
"調酒好喝、季節水果調酒特色十足，料理也相當出色。
老派日式酒吧風格，氣氛輕鬆悠閒，適合單人或雙人前來，不適合團體客人。","The bartending is delicious, the seasonal fruit is full of alcohol, and the cooking is also quite good.
The old -fashioned Japanese bar style, the atmosphere is relaxed and leisurely, suitable for single or double people, not suitable for group guests."
日式風格的酒吧，水果酒為主軸，我們選了草莓及釋迦，調出草莓酒及釋迦酒，釋迦酒非常特別，還保有釋迦的果肉，適合喜愛偏甜口味者。環境安靜，另外餐點也十分推薦，非常推薦喜愛水果酒的人試試。,"The Japanese -style bar, fruit wine as the main axis. We chose strawberries and Shakya, transferred strawberry wine and Shakya wine. Shakya wine was very special. It also kept Shakya's flesh, suitable for those who love sweet flavors.The environment is quiet, and the meal is also very recommended. It is recommended that people who love fruit wine are very recommended to try."
七點進場點了一堆吃的跟四杯還五杯酒，九點半被老闆請出場，因為後面有其他客人，結帳六千多元，應該比其他桌客單價高吧？感覺很奇妙，還想繼續點，但第一次被趕客,"At seven o'clock, I ordered a bunch of five glasses of wine with four cups of wine. I was invited by the boss at 9:30 because there were other guests in the back. It should be more than 6,000 yuan. Should it be higher than the unit price of other table guests?It feels wonderful, I want to continue, but I was rushed for the first time"
老闆很沒有禮貌，口氣很差，也不想去了解客人需求。低消$800，但入門消費前，完全不肯提供菜單參考，很奇怪，又不是無菜單料理⋯⋯各種對待客人的方式和態度都令人傻眼。,"The boss is very polite, his tone is poor, and he does not want to understand the needs of guests.It is a low -time $ 800, but before the entry consumption, it is unwilling to provide the menu reference. It is strange, but it is not a menu dish. The ways and attitudes of various treatments and attitudes are dumbfounded."
價位中上，品質優等，值得再訪的店家,"The price is high, the quality is excellent, and the store is worth visiting"
好吃好喝但但總價有點高，雖然品質對得起價錢但感覺也許有人沒辦法接受所有可能還是要注意一下～,"It's delicious, but the total price is a bit high. Although the quality is worth the price, it may be possible to accept everything."
台北有很多更好的bar可以選擇,There are many better bar in Taipei to choose from
是全台北最喜歡的調酒 ❤️❤️❤️,It is the favorite bartender in Taipei ❤️❤️❤️
很喜歡這裡安靜的氛圍，控制人數，可以讓我想休息的人，可以在這好好喝酒，真的很自在，很喜歡這邊，師傅也一直在進步，一直更新調酒、料理，謝謝🙏讓我可以好好休息、放鬆的好地方。 …,I really like the quiet atmosphere here and the number of controlling people. People who make me want to rest can drink well here. I really like this. The master has been improving. I can rest and relax a good place.Mowing
價格雖然偏高但是畢竟酒跟水果都是上上之選，加上老闆的調酒技術，也算是很物有所值的， 還有精彩的洋食可吃,"Although the price is high, after all, wine and fruits are the best choices. In addition, the bartending technology of the boss can be considered worthy of money, and there are wonderful foreign foods to eat."
水果調酒讓人驚艷❤,Fruit alcohol is amazing ❤
"食物非常好吃
酒非常好喝
不來真的是你的不幸
下次絕對會再來","Food is very delicious
Wine is very delicious
It's really your misfortune
I will definitely come again next time"
水果調酒十分美味！老闆很嚴謹的古典日式酒吧。,Fruit alcohol is very delicious!The boss's rigorous classical Japanese bar.
"酒真的不知道怎麼調配的
餐點一般般以外 服務態度真是驚為天人的不舒服
這是貴店經營之道嗎 不敢恭維
附近便利商店的礦泉水 都能讓我比較醉","I really don’t know how to prepare the wine
The service attitude of the meal is generally shocked by the uncomfortableness of heaven and man
Is this the way you operate in your store, dare not compliment
The mineral water of a nearby convenience store can make me more drunk"
沒想到平常的食物可以做的這麼美味！,I did not expect that ordinary food can be so delicious!
"調酒很好喝，均價一杯600。低消800。人數限3名以下。
環境有點普通。但酒真的很好喝。","The bartender is delicious, the average price is 600.Low 800.The number is limited to less than 3.
The environment is a bit ordinary.But wine is really delicious."
"這友人大推的店 日式的餐酒館
一入店很舒適有種回到家的溫度
餐點很精細去分類 沙拉 炸物 等等
都是簡單的擺設 沒有太多華麗的裝飾

值得一提 那新鮮水果的特調
層次分明 依喜愛的口味調配
這一入口 就知道店家高要求

來北部 非常推薦大家來試試
不過店裡有一些用餐的規範
去前記得要先詳閱","This Japanese -style dining tavern pushed by this friend
It's comfortable to enter the store and have a temperature that returns home
The meal is very fine to classify the salad fried material and so on
It's all simple furnishings without much gorgeous decoration

It is worth mentioning the special adjustment of the fresh fruit
The hierarchy is clearly deployed according to the favorite taste
I know the high requirements of the store at this entrance

I recommend everyone to try it very much when I come to the north
However, there are some meals in the store
Remember to read it before you go"
日本職人開的酒吧，用水果入調酒是一絕，但價格偏高且客人團體限制三人以內,"The bars opened by Japanese employees are a must for fruit to drink with fruits, but the price is high and the guest group is restricted to three people."
幫補血，看到垃圾人（不算客人，因為沒消費就被趕出去了，哈哈），進門不點餐/酒，只顧紀錄菜單，奇葩，是智商多低才會覺得記不住自己點的東西名稱？,"Help blood, see the garbage person (not a guest, because he was kicked out because he didn't consume, haha), did not order food/wine when you entered the door, just care about the recording menu. West name?"
老闆很有自己的堅持，對食物、酒和客人都很嚴格，能在深夜獲得美味料理的好地方，食物份量很多料很實在，山竹調酒很好喝。,"The boss has his own persistence. He is very strict with food, wine and guests. He can get delicious food in the late night. The food is very real. Mangosteen is very good."
好地方，很安靜，酒好喝,"Good place, very quiet, good wine"
台北我最喜歡的酒吧😇 …,My favorite bar in Taipei ...
精緻講究的日式風情，不管料理和調酒都很擅長，Bar 忠的東西好吃又好喝。,The exquisite Japanese -style style is good at cooking and bartending. Bar's loyal things are delicious and delicious.
想要喝好喝的調酒一定會來找bar忠 餐也超好吃,"If you want to drink delicious bartending, you will come to BAR loyal meals."
老闆的高級水果搭配上用心調酒真的是給五顆星都嫌少👍🏻 …,The boss’s high -grade fruits are really linked to the five stars.
酒好有創意，調酒很厲害，喝過最好喝的white Russian!,"The wine is very creative, the bartender is very powerful, and the best taste of White Russian has been drank!"
非常喜歡的一間店，連餐點都非常用心,"A store I like very much, even the meals are very attentive"
"水果系列調酒推薦
但價格偏高","Fruit series bartending recommendation
But the price is high"
有點過於昂貴但是餐點和氣氛都不錯的店家,"A bit too expensive, but a shop with good meals and atmosphere"
此地點已換人了，非酒館經營方式了呀，所以無從評論,"The location has been replaced here, the non -tavern is operating, so there is no way to comment"
調酒好喝，晚餐好吃！,"Blooming is delicious, dinner is delicious!"
規矩太多 老闆脾氣很大,Too many bosses have a big temper

很舒服的地方😆 …,Very comfortable place 的 ...
老闆很酷,The boss is cool
日式酒吧，空間舒適，吧台大約有12個座位，吧台前面有兩張桌子，所以去之前最好先預訂！預訂僅在當天下午 5 點開始。那天晚上我們點了7種口味的雞尾酒，山竹琴酒和桃子琴酒吸引了我。食物還可以！我很想下次嘗試不同的時令水果雞尾酒,"Japanese -style bar, comfortable space, there are about 12 seats in the bar, there are two tables in front of the bar, so it is best to book before you go!The booking only started at 5 pm that day.That night we ordered 7 flavored cocktails, mangosteen wine and peach piano wine attracted me.The food is okay!I really want to try different seasonal fruit cocktails next time"
舒適但確實是與朋友喝一杯的好地方。我買了老式茶，非常好。一定會回來！,"Comfortable but indeed a good place to drink with friends.I bought old -fashioned tea, very good.Will definitely come back!"
總的來說這裡一切都很好。我特別喜歡烤肉漢堡，醬汁味道好極了，我想沾麵包吃。炸雞也很好吃，外面酥脆，裡面多汁。絕對值回票價！希望他們接受線上預訂。,"In general, everything here is good.I especially like barbecue burgers. The sauce tastes great. I want to eat bread.The fried chicken is also delicious, crispy outside, juicy inside.Absolute return fare!I hope they accept online booking."
"我喝過的最好的水果雞尾酒！
服務也很好，工作人員很熱情。
台北的日式酒吧。
很安靜，可以在這裡進行高品質的談話。
但座位有限，週末最好19:30前來。

*注意：週末他們不接受超過兩人的客人。

*最低訂購量：每位客人 800 美元

- 荔枝雞尾酒：與伏特加完美搭配，就連像我這樣不太喜歡伏特加的人也受不了喝多了。甜甜的，能嚐到荔枝果肉的味道。

-山竹雞尾酒：特殊水果！比荔枝雞尾酒濃一點。味道清爽。

-海膽煎蛋捲：海膽的鮮甜十足。搭配銀魚蛋捲，就像嘴裡含著一片海洋。 CP值對得起。","The best fruit cocktail I have ever drank!
The service is also very good, and the staff is very enthusiastic.
Japanese -style bar in Taipei.
Very quiet, you can make high -quality conversations here.
But the seat is limited, it is best to come at 19:30 on the weekend.

*Note: They do not accept more than two guests on weekends.

*Minimum order volume: $ 800 per guest

-Lychee cocktail: perfectly matched with vodka, even people like me who don't like vodka can't stand it too much.Sweet, you can taste the taste of litchi pulp.

-Dhill mangosteen cocktail: special fruit!A little thicker than lychee cocktails.The taste is refreshing.

-A sea urchin fried egg roll: sea urchin is sweet and sweet.With silver fish egg rolls, it is like a ocean in his mouth.CP value is worthy."
"這是一個非常好的地方！這是台北最值得推薦的酒吧，有美味的雞尾酒和食物。

好建議，好喝，美食好喝，水果口味酒部分城市用的是新鮮水果飲用，超級好喝","This is a very good place!This is the most recommended bar in Taipei, with delicious cocktails and food.

Good suggestions, delicious food, delicious food, fruit flavored wine in some cities of wine, drinking fresh fruits, super delicious food"
喜歡那裡的炸雞。調酒師（也是老闆）擁有最好的舌頭和攪拌和搖晃的技巧。他家的瓜配VSOP非常👍🏻好！下次一定要去那裡 …,Like the fried chicken there.The bartender (also the boss) has the best tongue and the skills of stirring and shaking.His home with VSOP is very good!Be sure to go there next time ...
"🍍🍇看起來像在吃水果🥭🍈好酒🍸
令我驚訝的是，一杯飲料要650元，但荔枝雞尾酒太美味了，感覺就像吃了10顆荔枝一樣！氣氛很好，所以我還想再去一次（雖然有點貴，所以我想帶一個人一起去）！","水 Looks like eating fruit 🥭🍈 Good wine 🍸
What surprised me was that a drink was 650 yuan, but the litchi cocktail was too delicious, and it felt like eating 10 lychee!The atmosphere is good, so I want to go again (although it is a bit expensive, so I want to take someone to go)!"
台北最好的日本酒吧。完美的食物以及優質的雞尾酒和威士忌選擇。值得一遊。需提前預約。,The best Japanese bar in Taipei.Perfect food and high -quality cocktails and whiskey choices.It is worth visiting.You need to make an appointment in advance.
"日本設置酒吧。
最低費用為每人 800 台幣。
1 升普羅塞克 400ntd x2 =800","Set up a bar in Japan.
The minimum cost is 800 Taiwan dollars per person.
1 liter of Plasque 400NTD X2 = 800"
飲料和食物新鮮且有特色。店主是日本人，他對待食物就像是傑作。地點和室內設計都還可以，但有點貴，平均一杯台幣450-650元。,"Drinks and food are fresh and distinctive.The owner is Japanese, and he treats food like a masterpiece.The location and interior design are okay, but it is a bit expensive, with an average of 450-650 yuan."
美味的食物和令人愉快的雞尾酒。威士忌基薑蘇打水很棒。愛爾蘭咖啡比台北很多咖啡館都好喝。台北不容錯過的工匠雞尾酒吧。,Delicious food and pleasant cocktail.The whiskey base ginger soda is great.Irish coffee is better than many cafes in Taipei.The craftsman's cocktail bar that Taipei must not miss.
"我和我的朋友來這裡喝酒。這是一個非常好的場所，不允許超過兩個人進入（這是可以理解的，因為它是一個安靜的小酒吧）。咖啡莫吉托很棒。每人最低收費為 800 美元，因此如果您還想至少喝點飲料或吃點東西，最好來這裡。

一個缺點是，當我們進入時，工作人員問我們「你來自哪個國家？你來台灣多久了？請不要有‘麻煩’。但台灣客戶進來時並沒有被詢問或告知這一點。我只是想指出，並非所有外國人去酒吧都是為了喝醉並製造麻煩，假設我們會這樣做有點不公平。我和我的朋友只是想享受一些優質的雞尾酒。我希望工作人員能夠考慮到這些評論可能看起來具有歧視性，並使我們感覺自己不受歡迎。

總而言之，除了這一點，我絕對會推薦這個酒吧，因為雞尾酒很棒，而且氣氛非常好。酒精品質極佳，雞尾酒的調製也極為注重細節。我一定會回來的。","My friend and I come here to drink.This is a very good place that does not allow more than two people to enter (this is understandable because it is a quiet bar).Coffee Mogo is great.The minimum fee for each person is $ 800, so if you still want to drink at least drinks or eat something, it is best to come here.

A disadvantage is that when we entered, the staff asked us, ""Which country do you from? How long have you been in Taiwan? Please don't have"" trouble "". But when Taiwanese customers come in, they are not asked or informed of this. I just want to point out , Not all foreigners go to the bar to get drunk and make trouble. Suppose we will do this a little unfair. Discrimination and make us feel unpopular.

All in all, in addition to this, I will definitely recommend this bar because cocktails are great and the atmosphere is very good.The quality of alcohol is excellent, and the modulation of cocktails also pays great attention to details.I will definitely come back."
非常優雅的地方。它不適合那些想去參加聚會的人。你一定要去欣賞雞尾酒。工作人員非常專業；調酒師很棒。您不能在這裡舉辦大型聚會，最多只能有兩個人。目標是欣賞雞尾酒。另外，每人最低收費為新台幣800元。我在這裡過得很愉快。氣氛讓人想起紐約風格的爵士酒吧。雞尾酒也很美味。如果你喜歡這種風格，我強烈建議你試試看。,"Very elegant place.It is not suitable for those who want to attend the party.You must appreciate cocktails.The staff is very professional; the bartender is great.You can't hold a large -scale party here, there are only two people.The goal is to appreciate cocktails.In addition, the minimum fee for each person is NT $ 800.I live here well.The atmosphere is reminiscent of the New York -style jazz bar.Cocktails are also delicious.If you like this style, I strongly recommend that you try it."
"剛好是他們的三週年紀念日。
調酒師提供了一杯美味的柚子和柚子雞尾酒。可口。然而，接下來的事情卻相當令人震驚。我們點了一杯葡萄十號琴酒雞尾酒，用來自日本的新鮮葡萄製成，沒有爭論它的產地。

飲料來了而且擺盤很好。但飲料本身很淡，缺乏甜葡萄的新鮮香味，既不甜也不苦（來自杜松子酒）。但它有葡萄皮中單寧的苦味。總的來說，這只是平淡無奇。

威士忌酸是茶和葡萄的混合物，總體來說很美味，因此，我決定簡單地點另一杯來代替我原來的飲料，請注意，我沒有要求更換，只是要求一秒鐘。

我沒有喝完無聊的琴酒和葡萄，就向女服務生要了第二杯，一開始也沒有提出投訴。當她接著問我是否有異議時，我表達了我的意見。

我想，只是讓店主過來把我的飲料拿走，並告訴我飲料是有補償的，儘管我們幾乎沒有碰過它，並要求我們離開。

我對飲料沒有意見，可能只是不合我的口味。我不同意的是他如何回應這些批評，就好像這是對他的技能的侮辱。事實上，品味和階級是有的，而他在這種情況下卻沒有表現出來。

我建議任何未來的顧客閉嘴，喝完這 600 台幣的飲料，即使你覺得它很糟糕，而不是像我們向狄俄尼索斯乞討葡萄酒一樣被推出門外。","It happened to be their third anniversary.
The bartender provides a cup of delicious grapefruit and grapefruit cocktail.tasty.However, the next thing is quite shocking.We ordered a cup of grape 10 piano wine cocktails and made of fresh grapes from Japan without arguing about its place of origin.

The drink comes and the plate is very good.But the beverage itself is very light, lacking the fresh aroma of sweet grapes, neither sweet nor bitter (from Du Songzi wine).But it has the bitterness of tannins in grape skin.In general, this is just bland.

Whiskey acid is a mixture of tea and grapes, which is very delicious in general. Therefore, I decided to simply make another cup for my original drink. Please note that I did not ask for replacement, but just asked for a second.

I didn't drink the boring piano wine and grapes, so I asked the waiter for the second cup, and I did not make a complaint at first.When she then asked me if I had any objections, I expressed my opinion.

I think, let the owner come over to take my drink away and tell me that the drink is compensated, although we have hardly touched it and asked us to leave.

I have no opinion on drinks, maybe just do not fit my taste.What I don't agree with is how he responds to these criticisms, as if this is an insult to his skills.In fact, there are taste and class, but he did not show in this case.

I suggest that any future customers shut up and drink these 600 Taiwan dollars, even if you think it is bad, instead of being pushed out of the door like we begging wine from Dernezos."
"One of the best Japanese bars in Taipei! If you are both cocktail and food lover, this is the right place for you!

落ち著いた雰囲気のバーです。カクテルも料理も美味しいです。

個人認為是台北最好的日式酒吧之一，調酒跟料理都很精彩～店內氣氛安靜，適合喜歡靜靜品嘗美食美酒、不想被打擾的客人～","ONE of the Best Japanese Bars in TAIPEI! If you are both Cocktail and Food Lover, this is the right place for you!

Personally, I think it is one of the best Japanese bars in Taipei. The bartending and cooking are very exciting ~ The atmosphere in the shop is quiet, suitable for customers who like to taste food and wine quietly and do not want to be disturbed ~"
這是另一家很棒的日式酒吧，老闆是日本人。  裝潢優雅安靜；不允許超過 3 人聚會。  受日本影響的經典雞尾酒和時令水果雞尾酒都非常出色且調製得很好（百香果配伍德福德珍藏威士忌……味道好極了）。  除了飲料之外，Bar Chu 的食物也很棒，菜單會不時更換。  一些注意事項：1）每人有最低餐桌費（通常 2 杯雞尾酒就夠了）； 2）店主大多是一個人，既製作雞尾酒又製作食物，所以如果你趕時間，這裡不是一個好地方。  3) 該場所是酒吧而非餐廳，不接待只吃食物的客人； 4）與台北其他酒吧相比，價格可以高於平均水平，顯然品質不便宜，對食材和工藝有適當的尊重。  最終，這是一個提供高品質雞尾酒和美味佳餚的優雅場所，也是放鬆身心的好地方。,"This is another great Japanese bar, the boss is Japanese.The decoration is elegant and quiet; no more than 3 people are allowed.The classic cocktails and seasonal fruit cocktails affected by Japan are very good and well prepared (Paixiang fruit with Trendor treasures ... it tastes great).In addition to drinks, Bar Chu's food is also great, and the menu will be replaced from time to time.Some precautions: 1) Each person has the lowest dining table fee (usually 2 cups of cocktails); 2) The owner is mostly one person, which is made of cocktails and food, so if you are in a hurry, this is not a good place.3) The place is a bar instead of a restaurant. It does not receive guests who eat food; 4) Compared with other bars in Taipei, the price can be higher than the average level. Obviously, the quality is not cheap, and there is proper respect for ingredients and craftsmanship.In the end, this is an elegant place to provide high -quality cocktails and delicious dishes, and it is also a good place to relax."
超棒的店～焙茶gin tonic好喝！,The great shop ~ roasted tea GIN TONIC is delicious!
別來這裡。老闆很粗魯，不關心顧客。飲料很普通、很淡而且價格昂貴。這個地方給了我想成為地下酒吧的感覺。請注意，每人有最低消費規定，如果您是 4 人團體，則最低消費是雙倍。,"Don't come here.The boss is rude and does not care about customers.Drinks are very ordinary, light and expensive.This place gives me the feeling of being an underground bar.Please note that each person has minimum consumption regulations. If you are a group of 4, the minimum consumption is double."
非常美味的食物還有精緻的飲料。一定要嚐嚐蛋包飯！,Very delicious food and exquisite drinks.Be sure to taste the egg bag rice!
非常喜歡新鮮水果雞尾酒❤️❤️❤️,I really like fresh fruit cocktails ❤️️❤️ ❤️
"店內氣氛安靜，雞尾酒也很漂亮🍸
食物看起來很美味，但這是第三頓，所以我再次感到失望，但下次... …","The atmosphere in the store is quiet, and the cocktails are also very beautiful 🍸
The food looks delicious, but this is the third meal, so I feel disappointed again, but next time ..."
"很棒的地方，有令人驚嘆的新鮮水果雞尾酒。
好溫馨又寧靜~","A great place, with amazing fresh fruit cocktails.
So warm and quiet ~"
"這是一個簡單而優雅的絕對輝煌的地方。在這裡你看不到任何矯飾的表演，而是純粹的技巧。

我和男友吃完晚餐後很巧合地經過了這家酒吧。一開始我們只是想在回家的路上喝點小酒，但美味的飲料說服了我們待上兩個小時——我們不斷地點了一個又一個。

當我們坐下時，熱毛巾和 Tête de Moine 給我們留下了深刻的印象，但讓我們大吃一驚的是 Kaz。

卡茲是一位才華橫溢的紳士，他的雞尾酒和他的舉止一樣獨特而優雅。我們點了五杯飲料，每杯都比我們在世界各地喝過的任何飲料都要好。奶油蘭姆酒和時令水果飲料非常特別。品嚐用適當的 VSOP 調製的白蘭地雞尾酒也很棒。

完美主義。我肯定會回去更多。","This is a simple and elegant and absolute place.Here you can't see any decoration performance, but pure skills.

My boyfriend and I coincided with this bar after dinner.At the beginning, we just wanted to drink a little wine on the way home, but the delicious drinks convinced us to stay for two hours -we kept standing one after another.

When we sat down, the hot towel and Tête de Moine impressed us, but what surprised us was Kaz.

Kaz is a talented gentleman. His cocktails are as unique and elegant as his behavior.We ordered five drinks, and each cup was better than any drink we drank around the world.Cream Lan and seasonal fruit drinks are very special.It is also great to taste the appropriate VSOP Bailan, cocktail.

Perfectism.I will definitely go back more."

一位出色的大師會調製出您最喜歡的雞尾酒。,An excellent master will prepare your favorite cocktail.
老闆準備的酒很好喝，但老闆只聽員工的，不理顧客的意見，讓老顧客失望了。,老闆準備的酒很好喝，但老闆只聽員工的，不理顧客的意見，讓老顧客失望了。
酒食和水果酒都很棒。,Both wine and fruit wine are great.
不錯的雞尾酒，但價格過高。裡面允許吸煙（對我來說這不是一個優點😖）。週六下午開門。 …,"Good cocktails, but the price is too high.Smoking is allowed (for me, this is not an advantage).Open the door on Saturday afternoon.Mowing"
走了很長時間才走到這裡，儘管谷歌上顯示它是開放的，但結果卻是關門了。電話也不接。,"After walking for a long time, I came here. Although it shows that it is open on Google, the result is closed.The phone is not answered."
