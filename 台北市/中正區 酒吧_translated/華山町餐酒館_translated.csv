#在失去記憶前_其實還不錯喔
#很適合多人聚餐

店名：華山町餐酒館
地址：100台北市中正區八德路一段34號
捷運站：忠孝新生站過去約5分鐘
停車場：華山周邊
菜單：https://gmj.tw/zFG6j

價位（含服務費）：700-900
上菜速度：OK
服務：很貼心，因為我有請他推薦，不管菜的份量還是餐點選擇都有給我意見，在我猶豫的時候，也有主動提醒，可以上菜之後不夠再點，以及打卡的酒水優惠活動。
座位：寬敞，一般座椅還有靠窗的沙發座，感覺都很舒適

是否適合聚餐：適合，4-6人差不多

心得：
首先因為團購卷的關係，挺推薦大家去，雖然已經是十天前的聚餐，但我還是稍有印象。

不知道為什麼，在點餐的當下，我覺得所有東西都好貴喔…但事後想想好像也還好，反正通貨膨脹的關係，義大利麵在稍微有點氣氛的餐廳裡，均價400塊，已經是常態了。

除了炸蝦火山捲 (2隻炸蝦+4個加州風壽司)，雞肉丸肉醬寬麵，2項份量稍嫌不足（僅適合四個人吃）之外，其他餐點的份量都很大，凱薩沙拉上桌的時候，視覺上其實還挺驚人的，那是我見過最大的凱薩沙拉碗 (應該算是個盆？)，上面炸雞放很多。

松露野菇麵疙瘩：麵疙瘩的口感是蠻微妙的，不是硬的，但也不是到很軟的Q彈，稍稍有點粉粉的，松露的味道很重，因為起司放很多，如果僅有兩個人食用，應該會膩，味道非常不錯。

不知道別人在餐酒館是怎麼點餐的，我們整個碳水爆表，印象中飲料也都還不錯，我選擇 #柑橘啤酒 柑橘味不明顯，不是果酒，但也足以讓啤酒去了苦味。

滿分10分你打幾分：8分
會推薦朋友嗎：會","#, 4/8 dinner

Seats: spacious, general seats and window sofa seats, it feels very comfortable

Is it suitable for dinner: suitable, 4-6 people are almost the same

Experience:
First of all, because of the group purchase papers, I recommend everyone to go. Although it was a dinner ten days ago, I was still a little impressed.

I do n’t know why, at the moment of ordering, I think everything is expensive ... but afterwards, it seems that it is okay. Anyway, the relationship between inflation is in the restaurant in a slightly atmosphere, with an average price of 400 yuan. It's normal.

Except for fried shrimp volcanic rolls (2 fried shrimp+4 California wind sushi), chicken balls and meat sauce wide noodles, 2 parts are slightly not enough (only suitable for four people), the portion of other meals is very large, When the Caesar salad was on the table, it was actually very amazing visually. It was the largest Caesar salad bowl (should it be a pot?) I have seen a lot of fried chicken on it.

Tulu wild mushroom noodles: The taste of the noodles is pretty subtle, not hard, but it is not a very soft Q bomb. It is a little pink and the truffle has a heavy taste because there are a lot of cheese. Two people should be tired and taste very good.

I do n’t know how others order meals in the dining tavern. Our entire carbohydrate burst, and the drinks are also good in the impression. I chose #citrus beer citrus flavor is not obvious, not fruit wine, but it is enough to make beer bitter.

"第二次來用餐，真的每道菜都好好吃。最喜歡雞軟骨炸的剛剛好，pizza還可以點雙拼很棒！！凱撒沙拉+炸雞也剛好滿足肉食的我。蛤蜊真的新鮮又大顆，義大利麵也推薦！！小菜只有皮蛋太辣，炸小章魚好好吃。軟殼蟹火山捲還可以，壽司有點吃不出口感，就是不知道吃了甚麼，軟殼蟹也很後吃。

茶類都可以加熱水回沖，不是喝酒也吃的很愉快，喜歡店內氛圍。另外還有提供包場跟假日音樂表演的樣，適合4人以上用餐可以點比較多一起分享。

"這間餐廳是「天成文旅-華山町」的附設餐廳，就在華山文創園區旁，隔條馬路而已。離捷運藍線忠孝新生站1號出口僅200公尺。

午茶時段主推799元的雙人下午茶（含2個鹹派、2種蛋糕、荷蘭小鬆餅、馬卡龍等如所附照片），含250元飲料任選2，小鳥胃可以吃飽。

坦都香料蛤蜊義大利麵380元，好似微帶南洋咖哩風味，灰熊好吃啊！推！

焦糖轟雞翅300元6塊，外皮是脆的，有3個口味可選擇（川味、水牛城、椒鹽）這次點的是水牛城口味---有嗆酸的氣味，故覺得另2個口味應該會比較好吃，不過外酥內軟的雞翅，肉質是非常濕嫩，水份有鎖住。

但馬卡龍實在很不OK，我們各吃1口，直接放棄不吃了，也不外帶。鹹派的部分也很平凡。蕈菇鹹派有大量洋蔥，怕洋蔥的朋友，建議避開或選素的田園鹹派。

服務品質及用餐環境都還不錯，但整體餐價偏高，非CP優選餐廳，但來體驗一下也是不錯的。","This restaurant is an attached restaurant of ""Tiancheng Cultural Tourism-Huashancho"", just next to Huashan Cultural and Creative Park, just across the road.It is only 200 meters from the MRT Blue Line Zhongxiao Xinsheng Station.

But Macaron is really not OK. We eat one mouthful and give up without eating, nor do we take it.The salty part is also very ordinary.There are a lot of onions in the mushroom salty faction. Friends who are afraid of onions are recommended to avoid or choose the idyllic salty faction.

"今天用餐有購買夠麻吉餐卷，368元非假日可抵500消費，接近75折，蠻划算的喔！
華山町原為日治時代（樺山町），為紀念首任臺灣總督樺山資紀得名，現今華山文創等也都是由此得名。（華山）在我小時候搭宜蘭線火車時是一個貨運的重要車站，客車不停，但印象深刻。
華山町餐酒館／華山町文旅是臺北火車站旁老牌飯店天成飯店集團的關係企業，餐酒館的洗手間也與飯店相通，根據餐酒館的文字介紹，餐酒館原為臺灣銀行金庫，因此餐酒館與文旅也有一些金庫的元素，餐廳的大廳特別挑高，整體佈置帶有懷舊風，加上附近就有華山文創與三創園區，用餐的環境相當歡樂懷舊，現場還有鋼琴演奏，不過，鋼琴演奏時而太過大聲，影響到顧客的交談，這一點請業主要多多注意！
餐點的部分都有一定的水準，但又不到特別出彩驚艷的程度。

環境：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
- 用餐環境氣氛很好，很適合一群朋友一起大聲聊天，點一些酒類，一起share一些餐點和少少的主食，因為現場鋼琴音樂或背景音樂音量蠻大聲的，所以在這大聲講話似乎也不會讓別人太過刺耳。
- 廁所是到天成文旅大廳上，還算乾淨。

餐點：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

- 沙拉：韓式烤豚五花：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
豬五花是薄肉片，生菜附了三大片，生菜量其實有點少但算大片，把泡菜、蒜片、小黃瓜和肉再加上韓式辣醬一起泡進生菜裡大口咬下，真的很美味！

- 主食：金沙炸蝦意大利麵：⭐️⭐️⭐️
炸蝦外皮想脆，蝦肉口感柔嫩，還不錯吃，但是義大利麵的醬汁就不是很令人驚艷，醬汁體較濃厚但味道不重，和炸蝦也不是那麼般配。

- 主食：松露牛肝菌燉飯：⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
裡面認為最好吃的一道料理，牛肝菌味道醇厚，配上松露燉飯滿嘴都有菇類獨特香味，上面搭配的兩條杏鮑菇也很Q脆好吃，沒有菇類冰太久的味道。

-飲料：洋甘菊茶（熱）：⭐️⭐️⭐️

起司雞肉丸皮蛋肉醬寬麵，每到一家有義大利麵的店家,就很喜歡點上一份寬麵來體驗，麵條是喜歡的Q彈有勁道的口感，雞肉丸有些像日本串燒中的雞肉丸子的紮實，看起來小巧，但吃起來很有份量，而且，原來，起司和皮蛋原來也可以是好朋友，提出了一些金沙的味道。

華山町餐酒館位於天成文旅華山町內，餐廳風格延續飯店的銀行及製酒元素，晚上三五好友一起聚餐小酌頗有氣氛！
這裡的每道菜都是大份量，因此比較適合多人來用餐一起分享享用，每個人再點自己喜歡的調酒或其他軟飲就足夠飽足一餐。

推薦餐點：
1. 松阪豬白酒義大利麵
非常喜歡這道菜！那松阪豬的厚度跟數量實在是非常大方，尤其那晶瑩剔透的溫泉蛋在義大利麵上古溜古溜的滑動著，實在是讓人光是看了就覺得胃口大開！義大利麵的烹調技巧很到位，白酒、豬肉及蛋液的香氣都有跟麵條充分混合在一起，再配上厚實的松阪豬肉，真的是很棒！

2. 海陸雙拼烤飯
這是第二名喜歡的菜，除了份量大，海鮮與肉類也是給得毫不手軟。
烤飯看起來很像西班牙海鮮飯，因為加了點番紅花還有大量的海鮮，不過與西班牙海鮮飯不同的是，這邊的烤飯還融合了點韓國石鍋拌飯的元素，在鍋碗的底部有著微焦的鍋巴，且雞腿的部分也是採用韓式炸雞的方式，可以說一道菜一次滿足韓國及西班牙料理的味蕾！

3. 泡菜豚五花披薩
披薩的內餡是用泡菜跟五花肉做成，搭配滿滿的起司和黃芥末醬，味覺上的感受有非常多層次，除了有泡菜的微辣還有肉的香氣，更有黃芥末醬的酸及蔥花的香氣。是一道讓我驚艷也是第一次體驗到很有創意的披薩！

4. 鮮蝦飛魚卵火山卷
火山卷捏的很厚實，上面佐料是兩條大蝦子配上一點飛魚卵作點綴，由於在上桌前有用噴槍稍微炙燒烤過，起司有點融化牽絲，使得整體入口的口感很綿密扎實，整體來說還蠻喜歡這道菜。另外中間有附上炸牛蒡絲，可以當作下酒菜享用。","■ Consumption price: $ 500/person (holiday dinner)

Recommended meals:
1. Matsusaka pig white wine pasta
I like this dish very much!The thickness and quantity of Natsusaka pigs are very generous, especially the crystal -clear hot spring eggs sliding ancient and sliding on the Italian side. It really makes people feel that the appetite is open!The cooking skills of the Italian noodles are in place. The aroma of liquor, pork, and egg liquid is fully mixed with the noodles. It is really great with thick Matsusaka pork!

2. Haiku Shuangpin grilled rice
This is the second favorite dish. In addition to the large portion, seafood and meat are not soft.
The grilled rice looks like Spanish seafood rice, because there is a little saffron and a lot of seafood, but unlike Spanish seafood rice, the grilled rice here also blends the element of the Korean stone pot bibimbap. The bottom of the pot and bowl has a slightly burnt pot, and the chicken legs are also used in Korean fried chicken. It can be said that a dish can meet the taste buds of Korean and Spanish cuisine at a time!

3. Kimchi Dolkin pizza pizza
The filling of the pizza is made of kimchi and pork belly. It is full of cheese and yellow mustard sauce. The taste of the taste is very many levels. In addition to the spicy and meat aroma of kimchi, there are yellow mustard sauce. The aroma of acid and green onion.It is a pizza that makes me amazing and the first time I experienced very creative pizza!

4. Fresh shrimp flying fish egg volcanic roll
The volcanic roll is very thick. The above condiments are two large shrimp with a little flying fish eggs as embellishment. Because the spray gun has been grilled slightly before serving, the cheese is a bit melted.

"During my first visit to ""華山町,"" I ordered a few of their signature dishes, and I must say, both the presentation and flavors left quite an impression. The dishes incorporated a creative twist that combined elements of Taiwanese cuisine, which was rather delightful. Their innovative presentation genuinely wowed me, and the food itself was incredibly satisfying.

The overall atmosphere carries a charming English vintage pub concept. Being situated within the Tiancheng Art Hotel, they not only offer breakfast to their guests but also have plans to provide bar snacks, self-brewed coffee for afternoon tea, special cocktails, and craft beers during various meal times. The restaurant's distinct charm also makes it an excellent spot to admire the open-beam architecture.

The menu is quite diverse, featuring essential pub classics like fried foods and steak, along with individual items such as pizzas, risotto, and pasta. Notably, they serve Korean-style fried chicken, seafood pancakes, Japanese grilled mackerel, and their signature ""Volcano Roll."" These dishes aren't just aesthetically pleasing and Instagram-worthy; they're also absolutely delicious.

初訪<華山町>，點了幾道招牌餐點，料理表現亮眼，口味也不錯(有點結合台味的創意料理)，創意表現方式蠻令人驚艷，也有飽足感。

整體風格融入英式復古酒吧概念，因位於天成文旅內，除了供應客房早餐外，不同的餐期也會規畫提供酒吧輕食、自烘咖啡下午茶、特色調酒與精釀啤酒，店內特色同時也是欣賞無梁板建築的好地方。

餐廳提供多元豐富的餐食選擇，像是餐酒館必備的炸物與排餐，還有單品披薩、燉飯、義大利麵等主食，韓式炸雞、海鮮煎餅、日式烤鯖魚、招牌火山卷等，餐點不只好看、好拍也好吃","During my first visit to ""華山町,"" I ordered a few of their signature dishes, and I must say, both the presentation and flavors left quite an impression.

松露野菇燉飯超好吃😋
燻鮭魚海鮮也新鮮好吃，披薩餅皮稍微無聊一點。
火山卷系列雖是他們的招牌，但我反而覺得火山卷味道還好，炸蝦好吃，但軟殼蟹可能冷掉，軟軟的較無味道。

餐點很可口，生菜沙拉很清爽新鮮，牛排也不錯，朋友對豬肉的料理覺得非常滿意，但我不吃豬牛羊所以無法評論口味
韓式泡菜這盤料理好像是火山卷（我看門口也有火山卷的招牌，應該是他們店內的招牌料理）味道很棒，微酸微甜的韓式炸雞非常好吃

烤蔬菜的味道很清淡，作為配菜很剛好，又能吃出每種蔬菜的原食香味
