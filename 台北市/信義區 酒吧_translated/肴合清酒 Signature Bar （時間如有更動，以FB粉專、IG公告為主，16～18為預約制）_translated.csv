"薰爽醇熟的一晚
第一次接觸到純正清酒吧！
酒米/食用米/用水/口感香氣不同的組合很有意思，跟著唎酒師學習拆解跟認識清酒

店面走清爽又慵懶的現代風格，吧台內打光漂亮的酒櫃上是滿滿的酒旗還有各家社長的簽名或紀念包裝，與吧台外的簡潔形成一種獨特的雜糅感，像是現代包裝下有個懷舊的老派靈魂。
對愛酒人士來說，是家非常舒服的清酒吧。

店內滿牆的酒廠旗子，天花板有挑高，店內有一塊還做了下沉式地板（算是包廂），不大的空間因此充滿高度錯落的層次，非常舒適。

營業時間從下午四點就開始，一直到凌晨，這樣的營業時間，絕對是很多酒友的心靈綠洲🤣

【十四代 角新 中取 無濾過生酒】
「角新」系列均是作成無濾過生原酒。所以更讓你貼近原始的「生」與「鮮」！
酒米不公開，只說是用酒造好適米，但有人喝出是松山八反錦。
聞起來是香甜飽滿多汁的綠色蜜瓜果香。使用無重力自然垂滴，取得是最完整的中段--「中取」，喝起來超級順口，不是只有服貼滑順，而還加上「綿密細緻」，彷彿是在嗑多汁蜜瓜滴下來的果汁一樣。
【朝日鷹 特撰 本釀造】
聞起來香氣是小清新的西洋梨，沒像上一支那麼甜，喝起來也非常不錯。其實以我們平常在喝的較為日常平價的酒來說，「朝日鷹」算是非常厲害的喔！
這隻跟十四代可是直系血親，都來自於高木酒造，因此在平價酒系列中，「朝日鷹」還有一種花 1/3 價格，就更接近「十四代」的小確幸感覺。
這隻沒有像是「十四代」那麼華麗，但也有一種脫俗清麗的優雅。只是在「十四代」如此滑順綿密的極致頂規之後，「朝日鷹」就顯得沒那麼「服貼」了。但這也都是比較來的。因為查完價錢之後，你就會覺得「朝日鷹」物超所值啦！","Being able to meet a professional sake bar in Houshan, you can walk home without calling a car after drinking. It is really moved, grateful and grateful.

What is more valuable is that the manager's sake of sake is professional and he will introduce it, so every time you come, you have a lesson and increase your skills.

[Fourteen generations of horn, new middle middle school, no filter -free raw wine]
The ""Hedu New"" series is made into a raw wine without filtering.So let you get closer to the original ""Sheng"" and ""Fresh""!
Jiumi is not public, but only to make good rice with wine, but some people drink it is Songshan Eight Anti -brocade.
It smells the sweet and juicy green honeymaker fruity aroma.Using the natural drooping naturally, acquisition is the most complete mid-section- ""China Get"", which is super smooth. It is not just a smooth and smooth service, but also ""dense and meticulous"" The fruit juice is the same.
[The Asahi Eagle Special Brewery]
The aroma is a small fresh western pear. It is not as sweet as the previous one, and it is very good to drink.In fact, for the more daily cheap wines we usually drink, the ""Asahi Eagle"" is very powerful!
This is a straightforward blood relative with the fourteenth generation, all of which come from highwood wine. Therefore, in the cheap wine series, the ""Asahi Eagle"" also has a price of 1/3, which is closer to the ""Fourteen Generation"".
This is not as gorgeous as the ""Fourteen Generation"", but there is also a kind of refreshing elegance.Just after the ""Fourteenth Generation"" is so smooth and dense, the ""Asahi Eagle"" seems not so ""served"".But this is all comparison.Because after checking the price, you will feel that the ""Asahi Eagle"" is worth it!",False
