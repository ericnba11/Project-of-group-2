"門口長得很酷居然是衣櫃門
氣氛不錯 如果大家都點歌的話會很好玩～還會送shot（雖然那天有兩桌點歌但只喝到一輪）
樓下一人低消要800$ 適合多人聚餐+喝酒
那天跟朋友一人各點兩杯 酒單上的差不多都點完了 都很好喝！沒有特別怪味的
水餃好吃 超級愛剝皮辣椒皮蛋麵跟焦糖甜不辣 甚是想念 其他地方好像吃不到這味道
雞軟骨跟松板豬也好好吃
下次還會想回訪🫶🏻","The door is cool and it is a wardrobe door
The atmosphere is good. If everyone is singing, it will be fun ~ I will also send Shot (although there are two tables of singing that day, but only one round of drinking)
One person downstairs is 800 $ 800 suitable for multi -person dinner+drinking
That day, I ordered two cups of wine with friends that day, and it was delicious!No particularly weird
The dumplings are delicious, super love peeling pepper egg noodles and caramel sweet and not spicy, but I miss it elsewhere, other places, I can’t eat this taste.
Chicken cartilage and pine pigs are also delicious
I would like to return to visit next time 想",False
"看大家最近在這裡玩就訂位ㄌ！

食物蠻好吃的 但份量好少
一下子就吃完了 也偏貴
調酒的部分 有些味道不太喜歡
最喜歡的大概是啤酒吧

其中最棒的是B1有唱歌的地方
大家玩在一起的話真的非常快樂
但如果只是想專心喝酒吃飯的話
覺得試過一次就好(以上純屬個人立場(ง'̀-'́)ง","See everyone's time when you are playing here recently!

The food is delicious but the portion is small
It's also expensive after eating it all of a sudden
The bartender part doesn't like it, I don't like it
The favorite is probably the beer bar

The best one is the place where B1 has singing
It's really happy if you play together
But if you just want to concentrate on drinking and eating
I feel that I have tried it once (the above is purely personal position (ง '̀-'́) ง",False
"座位分樓上樓下，樓上無唱歌區低消500元，樓下唱歌區低消800元，用餐兩個小時，很準時會提醒時間到了。
🍽️餐點：基本都不雷，尤其家傳水餃大推必點！❤️酒類基本一杯都是350元左右，也都蠻不錯的，如果唱歌還會請shot，適合一群會玩瘋的朋友來！
⚡️唯一缺點：看評價麥克風音響好像一直是存在的問題（接觸不良斷斷續續），真的蠻可惜的希望店家能夠改善，唱歌的體驗會有點扣分🥲 （會不太敢推薦唱歌厲害的人來嗨）
會選這間餐廳的唱歌區一定是想要和不認識的一起唱歌同樂（就不用說要去錢櫃什麼的了），低消都收比較高一點了，希望能更新一下設備💖
很喜歡店家這個歡唱概念，歌曲也更新的蠻快的！如果是超級E人非常適合來這家店，店員也都很年輕很nice~","The seats are divided into upstairs. There is no singing area upstairs by 500 yuan, and the singing area downstairs will consume 800 yuan low. After two hours of meal, the time will be reminded on time.
本 ️ Meal: Basically, there are no thunder, especially the dumplings in the family must be pushed!❤️ Basically a drink of the wine is about 350 yuan, and it is pretty good. If you sing, you will also invite SHOT, suitable for a group of friends who will play crazy!
点️ The only disadvantage: See the evaluation microphone audio that seems to have always been a problem (intermittent contact with poor contact). It is really a pity that the shop can improve, and the singing experience will be a bit deducted (I will not recommend those who sing well. .
The singing area of ​​this restaurant must sing and sing with those who do not know (need not say that you want to go to the cash cabinet).
I like the concept of singing in the store very much, and the song is also updated very fast!If it is a super E, the clerk is very young and nice ~",False

店內很復古風，很用心營造環境，可以一邊吃一邊唱歌很有趣，食物都好吃，滷味烤的炸的炒的都好吃沒有雷，調酒也好喝，有人唱歌就送shot無限喝到飽(我喝了四杯)
缺點是唱歌音響很爛，麥克風接觸不良有時候沒聲音，影響唱歌體驗，但整體而言還是滿推薦的!","(800 yuan per person low)
The store is very retro style, and the environment is very careful. It is fun to sing while singing. The food is delicious. Full (I drank four cups)
The disadvantage is that the singing audio is very bad. Sometimes the microphone is poor and sometimes there is no sound, which affects the singing experience, but it is recommended as a whole!",False
餐點很好吃 服務很棒 而且氛圍非常棒 大家一起唱歌歡呼 很適合E人帶唱 I人聽歌吃美食 有人唱歌全場還有免費shot（一個人至少4-5杯） 推薦！,The meal is very delicious. The service is great and the atmosphere is very good. Everyone sings and cheers.
