餐點整體好吃，但部分的份量較少，食量大的可能得多點幾道菜才會吃的飽，需要事前預定的烤牛肉非常的推薦，份量足(一份14盎司NT$680)，但建議兩人以上再點，招牌的關東煮也不錯。

店內空間不大，目測大約坐20人左右應該就會覺得有點擠，店內整體保持的蠻乾淨的。

店裡推薦的酒都蠻好喝的，昨天聽到推薦隔壁桌點YEBISU啤酒，忍不住也點來嘗試，是跟平常市面上常看到的不一樣的黑藍底標籤，入口溫順泡泡很細緻，之後喝的清酒也好喜歡，清酒可以點單杯或開瓶，跟店家説想喝的類型，他們就會幫你推薦，昨天說想喝清爽、帶果香、偏甜，推薦的幾杯喝著都很好。

雞蛋飯：醃漬雞蛋不錯，貢丸湯沒有加分

香菜椒麻雞、炸水餃如其名，吃不出獨創口味的優勢。

店員頻繁詢問餐點如何，又再強調餐點的優秀特色，沒給客人說實話的空間，重複詢問不像是想聽真實的反饋，只讓人覺得頻繁被打擾。且一再重複推薦某項餐點，忽略留意客人喜好。

例如：喜歡偏酸的果實酒，但店員狂推偏甜的選項😆 （這樣是要怎麼點

因為主要是去用餐，覺得搭配清爽、口味單純的清酒會更適合；店員推薦然後點了口味複雜的清酒，沒有相得益彰，味道互相打架，美酒都浪費了。

很多日本的清酒種類可以選擇，老闆會很熱心的解說跟推薦酒款，最後點了一瓶純米酒等級的生酒。酒款非常符合我們的需求（我們跟老闆說越甜越好），完全沒有想到純米酒等級的清酒的香氣可以比很多大吟釀等級的還要濃厚。但味增蛋黃漬不是那麼出色（雖說用的是酒米但吃起來跟普通米沒什麼兩樣）。炸雞、生蠔拌麵都還不錯。整體而言下酒菜價格稍嫌高了些。,"Many Japanese sake types can be selected.

看了很久才坐上電梯上二樓餐食區、很像日本下班後會去小酌的小店，親切的服務介紹著餐食酒品、果然是台北ㄧ級消費區,"After watching it for a long time, I took the elevator to the second floor of the meal area on the second floor, and it was very similar to the small shop that I would drink after get off work in Japan.

食物太貴，而且吃起來真的很普通，實際體驗跟網路大量好評內容完全不同，烤物都250起跳而且量很少，不信邪多點了三四樣還是不怎麼好吃，很鹹很貴的兩片仙貝，肉很硬柴的關東煮，烤五花肉還行但很油，胡椒醃雞肉也超鹹吃不出其他滋味，只有覺得味噌蛋黃飯還不錯吃。酒還不錯，只是也超級小杯，點非清酒類超不划算，清酒小杯就還可以,"The food is too expensive, and it is really ordinary. The actual experience is completely different from the large number of praise content of the Internet. The roasted objects are jumped at 250 and the amount is very small.

I only feel that the miso egg yolk rice is not bad.The wine is not bad, but it is also a super small cup.",False
東西每一樣都很好吃，有啤酒也有清酒，一樓看來破舊，但來到二樓發現別有洞天，很乾淨有氣氛，店內不大只有幾桌，缺點就是酒別喝太多，清酒價格不便宜,"Everything is delicious. There are beer and sake.

這家小酒館曾經是 Koma Sake Bistro，但它改了名字，所以我在 FB 上詢問菜單是否相同，他們說「是」。菜單上的菜色是一樣的，但執行方式與以前有女廚師時不同。食物不一樣，新的變化很糟糕，我們沒有吃完我們點的任何菜餚。在菜單上，我們選擇的魚是味噌比目魚，而魚不是比目魚。他們為我們提供的魚是黑鱈魚，這是一種不同的魚。我當了 23 年的專業廚師，他們試圖以一種魚冒充另一種魚，好像人們不知道一樣。好吧，我知道。炸雞（Karrage）根本沒有打漿，只是調味。雖然很溫柔，但這並不是我們所期待的。關東煮和以前不一樣了，都是商店買的，放在火鍋裡的那種。唯一好的就是關東煮肉湯和啤酒。一切都不值得參觀。明亮的燈光太可怕了！我很喜歡科馬的昏暗燈光。不過，現在有窗景的大空間非常好。但食物很糟糕！我很高興在我們考慮點清酒之前決定嘗試這裡的食物。在真正的日本清酒小酒館時尚中，您的食物必須很好，否則提供清酒就沒有意義。此外，我們沒有註意到菜單背面的每位客人的價格，因為它應該與其他所有內容一起印在正面，而我們只是在用餐過程中才被告知。在品嚐了前幾道菜後，我不可能再點任何食物來增加我們的支票，我告訴工作人員這一切，所以他們讓我們按原樣支付賬單。我認為這個地方正在接受新的管理，不值得再去。很傷心，因為我真的很喜歡以前在那裡的許多用餐體驗。我不會再回去了。廚娘在哪裡？廚房裡的小伙子為什麼做菜不好？,"This tavern used to be Koma Sake Bistro, but it changed its name, so I asked the menu on the FB whether the menu was the same, they said ""yes"".The dishes on the menu are the same, but the execution method is different from when there were female chefs.The food is different, the new changes are bad, we have not finished any dishes we ordered.On the menu, the fish we choose is miso fishes, and the fish is not better than the fishes.The fish they provide for us are black cod, which is a different kind of fish.I have been a professional chef for 23 years. They tried to impersonate another fish with one fish, as if people didn't know.Well, I know.Karrage did not be pulled at all, just seasoning.Although very gentle, this is not what we expect.Kanto cooking is not the same as before. They are all bought by the store and put in the hot pot.The only good thing is the Kanto cooking broth and beer.Everything is not worth visiting.The bright light is terrible!I like Koma's dim light.However, there is a large space with window views very well.But the food is bad!I am glad to decide to try the food here before we consider ordering sake.In the real Japanese sake tavern fashion, your food must be very good, otherwise it is meaningless to provide sake.In addition, we did not notice the price of each guest on the back of the menu, because it should be printed on the front with everything, and we were only told during the meal process.After tasting the first few dishes, I couldn't order any food to increase our check. I told the staff all this, so they asked us to pay the bill according to the original.I think this place is undergoing new management and is not worth going again.Very sad, because I really like many dining experiences there before.I won't go back anymore.Where is the chef?Why is the guy in the kitchen not good?",False
