"價位偏高～～
但餐點都很好吃！酒類有很多選擇～晚上來小酌配餐是很舒服的✨✨🫶🏻 …","The price is high ~~
But the meals are delicious!There are many choices for alcohol ~ It is very comfortable to eat meals at night ..."
"在行天宮後面巷子內
安安靜靜的店
沒想到晚上也滿多客人的
主要是梅酒跟清酒
酒單在牆上很特別

但是缺點是沒有無酒精飲料
只有氣泡水
讓朋友來沒有東西點

然後點了烏龍嗨結果
烏龍茶還要先去買一下
有點尷尬哈哈哈

可以聊天喝酒的好地方","In the alley behind Xingtian Palace
An quiet shop
I didn’t expect to be full of guests at night
Mainly plum wine and sake
The wine list is very special on the wall

But the disadvantage is that there is no alcoholic drink
Only bubble water
Let your friends come without something

Then clicked the Uolong Hi result
Oolong tea, buy it first
A little embarrassing hahaha

A good place to chat and drink"
"外場一位內場一位稍嫌忙碌，沒有菜單因為都寫在牆上&黑板上～一進來被很壯觀的酒瓶嚇到想要喝什麼酒都有竟然也有調酒！
但不適合買醉是適合小酌的地方🤣當天只有點小食整體價位小高～～～去完直接殺去吉林路突然好想吃熱炒可能是開胃了🤤","An in the field is a little busy, and there is no menu because they are written on the wall & blackboard ~ When they come in, they are scared by the spectacular bottle.
But it ’s not suitable for buying drunk. It’ s suitable for drinking. 🤣 Only a little snacks were small on the same day."
雖然主餐價位稍高，但吃第一口就知道絕對值得這個價位！！詢問店員後店員也相當親切的推薦適合的清酒，實際喝到後也覺得非常符合本人的喜好，雖然有部分想喝的酒及餐點好像賣完了，不過之後一定會再次光臨所以無妨^^,"Although the price of the main meal is slightly higher, it is definitely worth this price when eating the first bite!IntersectionAfter asking the clerk, the clerk was also very kind to recommend suitable sake. After actually drinking it, I also felt very in line with my preferences. Although some of the alcohol and meals I wanted to drink seems to be sold out, it will definitely come again."
"因為剛好在家附近
所以過來看看，
不是很懂清酒但點了一杯清酒
覺得非常普通，
幸好有生啤可以點，
但是也沒有感覺特別，
最後點了一杯紅茶梅酒，
嗯…還可以
但一樣兩口就沒了..
有收一成服務費
總共點了一杯清酒
一杯生啤 一杯梅酒
總共600多～
單純覺得CP值不高，
不過座位還蠻舒服的。

回覆業主：
嫌貨才是買貨人～
能開在算是蠻偏僻的巷內，
如果有必殺技或是當天可以招待一把毛豆
可能生意會好一點。
（我們當天三人共點9杯酒）","Because it happened to be near home
So come and see,
I don’t know how to clear sake, but I ordered a glass of sake
I feel very ordinary,
Fortunately, there are raw beer to order,
But I didn't feel special,
Finally ordered a glass of black tea plum wine,
Hmm ...
But the same two are gone ..
There is a 10 % service fee
A total of a glass of sake
A glass of raw beer, a glass of plum wine
A total of more than 600 ~
I just think the CP value is not high,
But the seat is quite comfortable.

Reply to the owner:
The suspect is the buyer ~
Can be opened in a pretty remote alley,
If you have a nirvana or you can entertain a pair of edamame on the same day
Maybe business will be better.
(We order 9 glasses of wine on the day)"
"海膽鮭魚燉飯非常驚艷好吃，感覺得出店家很用心的在做料理。
但服務生個性比較酷，對客人的招呼有點冰冷，不懂酒的人可能會不知道要怎麼點","Sea urchin salmon stew is very amazing and delicious, and I feel that the store is very careful to cook.
But the waiter's personality is cool, and the greetings of the guests are a bit cold. People who do not understand wine may not know how to order."
"菜單寫在黑板上，單價偏高但品質絕對跟得上它的價格。

店員不會過於熱情，但很親切也很專業，個人覺得是很舒適的服務。
食物好吃、用料實在新鮮，每一杯酒都很滿意。
店內氣氛很好，安靜也蠻適合聊天。","The menu is written on the blackboard. The unit price is high but the quality is definitely up to its price.

The clerk will not be too enthusiastic, but very kind and professional. I personally think it is a very comfortable service.
The food is delicious and the ingredients are fresh, and each glass of wine is very satisfied.
The atmosphere in the store is very good, and quiet is also suitable for chatting."
"進店的時候完全沒有客人, 店員顧著聊天完全沒有招呼沒有帶位也沒有介紹, 餐點不錯但分量很少, 結帳才知道要收10%服務費","When I entered the store, there were no guests at all. The clerk didn't say hello to the chat without greeting, and did not introduce it. The meal was good but the amount was very small."
"剛結束今天的用餐，
訂六點的兩位，
非常愉快~
店裡主打的是酒，
像我這種第一次來不懂酒的也不用擔心，
老闆會很仔細的根據點的餐點、客人的偏好(酸、甜)推薦適合的酒，
餐點也很好吃
物有所值，
適合小酌聊天的餐廳~","Just finished today's dining,
Book the two of the six o'clock,
Very happy ~
The main shop in the store is wine,
I do n’t have to worry about those who do n’t understand wine for the first time.
The boss will be very careful based on the meal, the preferences of the guests (sour, sweet) recommended, the suitable wine,
The meal is also delicious
It is worthwhile,
Suitable for a restaurant for chatting ~"
"台北最不會聊天酒吧，只能5顆星了！
東西好吃，老闆選的酒又好喝！
也不會刻意找客人聊天，這種好店不推不行！
根本是天堂般的存在❤️","Taipei will not have a chat bar, only 5 stars!
The things are delicious, the wine chosen by the boss is delicious!
I won't deliberately find guests to chat. This good shop can't push it!
It's a heavenly existence at all ❤️"
"店小小的住宅區中一點微光！可以看球賽，清酒特色為基底，餐點是吃巧不能吃飽，如果要約會不推薦，和哥們適合來聊天聊球聊牌，沒有妹子喔！

2021/12
十點後沒有餐點喔！老闆持續更新酒單，烏龍嗨嗨真的很嗨～很像老人烏龍茶！不會太濃烈，很清爽～喝完苦苦生啤，喝這個很醒酒來的😂

2022/5/3
老闆延長供餐到11點喔！獺祭老闆也有來簽名畫押到此一遊唷～低調的奢華！老闆手藝了得～選酒品味也是很不一樣，定時更換酒單，口味都很厲害","A little light in the small residential area of ​​the store!You can watch the ball game. The specialty is based on the characteristics of the sake. The meal is that you ca n’t be full. If you want to date, you do n’t recommend it. It ’s suitable to chat with buddies.

2021/12
There is no meal after ten o'clock!The boss continues to update the wine list, oolong Hi Hi is really hi ~ It looks like an old man oolong tea!It's not too strong, it's refreshing ~ After drinking bitter beer, drink this very sober.

2022/5/3
The boss extends the meal until 11 o'clock!The otter sacrifice owner also has a signature painting here for a trip ~ Low -key luxury!The boss has a good craft ~ The taste of the wine is also very different. The taste of the wine regularly is very powerful."
"好喜歡這家溫馨cozy、挑酒出眾，食物美味的清酒吧，一定會再來！選了3杯單杯都很不錯，都是果味飽滿、旨味有厚度的。食物皆好吃又佛心，特別愛爐烤蔬菜、燻鮭沙拉和多汁雞胸。焗烤鮭魚盅份量不大，鮭魚有點烤太老。起司舒芙蕾鬆軟酥香，但等了足有30分鐘以上。如果不介意出餐有點久，每杯酒份量不多 (60ml)，非常適合來小酌。

酌收10%服務費，可刷卡。","I really like this warm cozy, outstanding wine, and delicious food, you will definitely come again!The 3 cups of single cups are very good. They are full of fruit flavor and thickness.The food is delicious and Buddha's heart, especially love stove roasted vegetables, smoked salmon salad and juicy chicken breast.Baked grilled salmon cups are not large, and salmon is a bit grilled.The cheese Shullele was soft and crispy, but waited for more than 30 minutes.If you don't mind the meal for a long time, the amount of wine per cup is not large (60ml), which is very suitable for drinking.

Get 10%service fee, you can swipe the card."
"我的超級愛店之一❤️
前後總共去過4-5次了～對於一個近年來不在台北生活的人來說應該是算次數很高了吧🤣
他們家的酒好喝 餐點會根據不同時節些微更換
但也從來沒有踩過雷
平日假日都去過，雖然店面不大但整個空間很舒服
如果椅子換成可以倚背的應該可以坐更久🤣","One of my super-love shops❤️
A total of 4-5 times before and after - for a person who has ubiquitous Taipei life in recent years should be very high in accounting 🤣
The Good Drink of Good Drinking of God of Good Resorts will be slightly replaced according to different times
But also never stamped through the thunder
I have been there on weekdays and holidays, although the shop is not large but the whole space is very comfortable
If the chair is replaced to lean back should be able to sit longer 🤣"
非常多日本酒可以挑，有想要的味道可以問老闆推薦的酒，環境很舒服東西也好吃,"Many Japanese wine can be picked, and if you want the taste you want, you can ask the boss recommended by the boss. The environment is very comfortable and delicious."
少見主打清酒的日式居酒屋，有各種台灣少見的清酒可以點，都是喝冰過的。店內的料理也很不錯，這次試了炸牡蠣，蟹肉奶油豬油麵包，日式漬物，燉飯等，食物口味偏重，很適合下酒。價位偏高，兩人吃完大約1500。,"Rarely -known Japanese -style izakaya, which is mainly based on alcohol, has a variety of rare sake in Taiwan that can be ordered.The food in the store is also very good. This time, I tried fried oysters, crab meat cream lard bread, Japanese -style stains, stewed rice, etc. The taste of the food was very important, which was very suitable for wine.The price is high, and the two have eaten about 1500."
"店面小小間的氣氛很好
菜單及酒單都是記錄在黑板上
價格稍貴但很美味","The atmosphere in the small room is very good
The menu and wine list are recorded on the blackboard
The price is slightly expensive but very delicious"
鮭魚排海膽燉飯實在太好吃了，一口接著一口啊！這邊氣氛很好，老闆推薦的清酒都很好喝，很清爽還有後韻，我們嘗了六款的酒，記不住酒名，但最後一款是梅酒，喝起來很爽口，帶點微微的香甜，很適合女生❤️ 就在行天宮附近，走路五分鐘就到公車站很方便！,"Salmon rowing sea urchin stewed rice is so delicious, one bite after a bite!The atmosphere here is very good. The sake recommended by the boss is very delicious. It is refreshing and the charm. We have tasted six wines and can't remember the name of the wine, but the last one is plum wine. Slightly sweet, very suitable for girls ❤️ Just near Xingtian Palace, it is convenient to walk in the bus station for five minutes!"
"價格稍高，小酌微醺很棒，要吃飽或是買醉可能不便宜
清酒酒類選擇多","The price is slightly better, the drink is great, it may not be cheap to eat or buy drunk
There are many choices"
"義大利麵的調味口感食材都非常不錯，份量適中，口感柔順醬汁溫和不膩口，鴨胸意外的令人驚艷，柔軟搭配的醬汁吃起來非常舒服一份560元。店內的生啤新鮮氣泡綿密不刺激，甜味口感十足。店內無紅白酒純提供清酒燒耐梅酒。

但音樂不太行。","The pastoral texture of the pasta is very good, the portion is moderate, the texture is soft and not greasy, the duck breast is unexpectedly amazing, and the soft sauce eats very comfortable 560 yuan.The fresh bubbles of the fresh beer in the store are dense and non -irritating, and the sweet taste is full.There are no red liquor in the store to provide sake and roast the plum wine.

But music is not very good."
"清酒專門酒吧，老闆會為你量身推薦適合的清酒選項，品嚐清酒的好去處。佐酒餐點有一定水準：
-炸牡蠣佐松露美乃滋：鮮嫩牡蠣炸得酥脆，配上松露美乃滋十分開胃。

-托斯卡尼鹽醃豬背脊：沒吃過這個部位，其實就有點像是油花多的火腿，灑上鹽和胡椒，配著麵包吃，也是一道蠻下酒的小點。

-奶油蟹肉佐豬油麵包：這道的奶油醬超香超適合沾麵包，豬油麵包也很特別，可惜覺得蟹肉有點少，但仍然獲選今日最愛菜色！

整體來說水準不錯，可惜出餐速度太慢了，平均出一道菜要25分鐘，這部分改善的話還是可以常常回訪。","For a special bar, the boss will tailor you to the suitable sake options for you to taste the good place for sake.There is a certain level of wine meal:
-On fried oyster Satoi Nagoi: The fresh and tender oysters are crispy, and it is very appetizing with truffle.

-Toscani salt marinated pork back: I haven't eaten this part, in fact, it is a bit like ham with oily flowers, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and eating bread. It is also a small little bit of wine.

-Am cream crab meat and lard bread: This creamy sauce is super fragrant suitable for dipping bread. Large bread is also very special. Unfortunately

Overall, the level is good, but unfortunately the meal is too slow, and the average dish is 25 minutes on average. If this improvement is improved, you can often return to visit."
適合單純前來或朋友小聚的空間，雖然不大但也不會過於壓迫。可以品嚐多樣清酒、也推薦同時品嘗店內的料理，可以感受到對料理的用心。,"It is suitable for simply coming to or friends, although not large, it will not be too oppressed.You can taste a variety of sake, and also recommend the food in the store at the same time, and you can feel the intention of cooking."
"行天宮巷弄間的小驚喜！食物好吃，酒種多元，環境很舒服放鬆～

這家店主打日本帶回來的各種酒類，牆壁上會不定期更新酒的口味與介紹，除了酒外，也有許多適合搭配日本酒的冷盤食物。

雖然正餐食物的選擇不算非常多，但口味都很棒，特別是墩飯的味道很豐富，十分推薦～","Little surprise between Xingtian Gongxiang!The food is delicious, the wine is diverse, the environment is very comfortable and relaxed ~

The owner of this shop is the various wines brought back by Japan. The taste and introduction of the wine will be updated from time to time. In addition to the wine, there are many cold dish foods suitable for Japanese wine.

Although there are not many choices of food foods, the taste is great, especially the taste of the pier rice is very rich, it is very recommended ~"
"位置不多，但環境很舒服，適合約會，也是好兩三個好友聚餐。
餐點很不錯，口味優雅，食材實在，但價位偏高。
清酒很多元也很有水準，老闆都很樂意介紹，清酒價位滿公道，推推～","There are not many positions, but the environment is very comfortable. It is suitable for dating. It is also a good two or three friends.
The meal is very good, the taste is elegant, the ingredients are real, but the price is high.
A lot of sake is also very standard. The boss is happy to introduce."
"位居巷內小店
清酒選擇多樣化 很適合熱愛清酒的人
單杯價錢ok可以嘗試很多種類的清酒
配菜份量算大","Located in the small shop in the alley
Selection of sake diversification is suitable for those who love sake
Single cup price is ok, you can try many types of sake
The amount of dishes is large"
"餐點：好吃 價格合理
酒：當天一共叫了五輪 七杯酒/人 可以請店家依據餐點，建議適合搭配的酒。但覺得酒很小杯啊⋯⋯","Meal: Delicate price reasonable price
Wine: On the same day, a total of seven glasses of wine/person can ask the store to use meals based on meals, and it is recommended to match wine.But I think the wine is small cup ..."
低消一杯酒/人，沒限時，可刷卡。餐點用心做且口味適合我。單杯酒款選品跟風潮，會再訪～,"Low a glass of wine/person, you can swipe your card without time.The meal is made with my heart and the taste is suitable for me.Single cup of wine selection and trend, visit again ~"
"白色的利口酒甜甜的適合女生喝！大推！
食物也很不錯！炸牡蠣好吃！醬汁調料都做得很用心！","White Likou wine is sweet for girls!Push!
The food is also very good!Fried oysters are delicious!The sauce seasonings are very careful!"
"首先必須說東西本身是不錯吃的所以有兩顆星
，唯一的問題是服務態度，
第一，進店之後完全沒有服務，只點頭說可以隨便坐，就回頭繼續跟吧台區的熟客聊天，如果要新客人自己到櫃台點餐，是否該在黑板上註明？或是客人入座時提醒客人呢？
像是：（決定好了可以來吧台點餐唷）
我們入座之後進來的兩組客人都是一樣不知所措的情況。

第二，點餐時很清楚表示是要干貝鮭魚麵，上菜時是番茄雞肉麵，先生吃一口覺得有點怪，但因為餓了也就繼續吃了，等結帳時稍微提了說，不好意思我點的是干貝鮭魚麵，為何裡面會有雞肉？
得到的答案是：（這不可能哦，我們上的是干貝鮭魚麵，裡面不可能有雞肉！）
我：（我們是吃到了雞肉）
吧台：（那是不可能的！一定是你搞錯了）

剛剛看了照片，我點的干貝鮭魚麵看來是白醬（第一張），當天上來的麵是紅醬（第二張），
所以您所謂的不可能，是什麼意思呢？

菜單出帳有疑問的時候，為何不是先問看看廚房，先看看走菜的情況，就直接質疑客人，這樣的態度實在可惜了好吃的菜，
您可以一直都是對的，不過客人會不會因為您是對的，就再回來呢？","First of all, you must say that things itself is good to eat so there are two stars
, The only problem is the service attitude,
First, there is no service at all after entering the store. I just nodded and said that I could sit casually, so I went back to chat with the cooked customers in the bar area. If the new guests have to go to the counter to order, should I indicate on the blackboard?Or remind the guests when the guests enter the seat?
Like: (Decided, you can come to the meal meal)
The two groups of guests who came in after they took the seat were the same situation.

Second, I know it is clearly stated when I order meal. It is a tomato chicken noodle when I go to the food. I feel a little strange when I take a bite, but I continue to eat because I am hungry. I am so embarrassed that I ordered the scallops salmon noodles. Why does it have chicken inside?
The answer to get is: (This is impossible, we are on the scallops salmon noodles, there is no chicken in it!)
Me: (We have eaten chicken)
Bar: (That's impossible! You must have made it wrong)

I just looked at the photo. The scallop salmon noodles I ordered it seemed to be white sauce (the first one).
So what do you mean, what do you mean?

When the menu is questioned, why not ask the kitchen first and look at the situation of the food first, and directly question the guests. This attitude is a pity.
You can always be right, but will the guests come back because you are right?"
"極度不推薦的店家
4/14前往店家消費
一進店給人高級感的視覺
餐點好吃新鮮酒好喝
但⋯⋯⋯
碰到一位進門沙發區戴眼鏡的客人
感覺像是店家認識的朋友或常客我不確定
喝酒聊天講話音量大都能理解
但是這位客人音量是特別大
還會很大聲的ㄍㄧㄠˇ髒話
我以為我在林森的酒店
讓人感到很不安全的感覺
完全影響到消費的體驗
店家貼禁菸
還在室內抽加熱菸
店員也沒有在禁止
對於這種自己朋友來
就不顧其他顧客消費感受的店家
實在是很不推薦
你永遠不知道會不會被這樣的客人找麻煩
不會再去消費了也會請朋友別去","Extremely not recommended store
4/14 Go to the store for consumption
As soon as you enter the store, a high -level vision

But ...
Meet a guest who entered the sofa area to wear glasses

Most of the volume of drinking and speaking speeches can be understood
But the volume of this guest is particularly large
It will also be very loud
I thought I was in Linsen's hotel
It makes people feel unsafe
Completely affecting the experience of consumption

Still heating cigarettes indoors
The clerk is not prohibited
For this kind of friend
The store that regards the consumption experience of other customers
It's really not recommended
You never know if you will be troubled by such guests
If you won't go to spend anymore, you will invite friends not to go"
"餐點很普通，清酒倒是一絕，這家重點的確是清酒，食物點個意思意思即可。

氣氛是年輕氛圍，音樂頗為大聲","The meal is very ordinary, and the sake of sake is a must. This focus is indeed sake, and the food can be meant.

The atmosphere is a young atmosphere, and the music is quite loud"
"行天宮拜拜完附近找了這家來小酌
餐點CP高而且都有一定水準，海膽燉飯很好吃大推薦！
清酒啤酒都有，價位也很合理，是家會想再來的店","Xingtian Palace, after worshiping the nearby, found this one to drink
The meal CP is high and there are a certain level. The sea urchin stewing rice is delicious and recommended!
There are alcohol beer, and the price is also very reasonable."
"臺北市最棒的清酒吧，沒有之一。
我不能評論更多了，這絕對是我的私房地點....","There is no one in Taipei's best sake bar.
I can't comment more, this is definitely my private real estate ..."
專賣清酒的店面，可以單杯品飲或是買整瓶，空間上明亮，餐點味道也還不錯，期待有更多清酒可以選擇，或是上酒時，來點介紹也行,"The store that specializes in sake, you can drink or buy a whole bottle in a single cup. The space is bright, the meal tastes good. I look forward to more sake to choose from, or when you are in alcohol, you can introduce it."
"日本酒おすすめです。

很久沒來，今天情人節，點了杯薰香紅茶酒跟綜合起士拼盤。明天不用補班，輕鬆自在。
還是喜歡這裡的氣氛，一個人喝或是聚在一起喝都沒有壓力。","Japanese wine.

I haven't come for a long time. Today, Valentine's Day, ordered a cup of incense black tea wine and a comprehensive cheese platter.No need to make up tomorrow, easy to be comfortable.
I still like the atmosphere here. There is no pressure to drink or gather together."
"食物很有水準，鴨胸超推
老闆專業能推薦好喝的清酒
大推「出羽之旅」和「山廢純水」
這兩隻香味足而且味道很醇厚","Food is very standard, duck breasts are super push
The boss can recommend delicious sake
Push ""Journey to the Feather"" and ""Shan Waste Pure Water""
These two scents and mellow flavor"
"我是原本在網路上查到的，想說今天剛好休假去吃吃看反正我也住附近而已，我進去點完餐差不多九點整，因為我看評論說這間的餐點要等很久我就有特地看了一下，我點了起司舒芙蕾跟煙燻鴨胸，就這兩道而已我等了快一個小時其實中途我有想要跟他說我等太久我想要離開，但我轉念一想說不定送上來很好吃呢？我就繼續等，送上桌後，菜色都還不錯，起司舒芙蕾很香但就是如果旁邊放個胡椒或鹽巴我覺得會滿分，鴨胸也好吃，我覺得都在價格的合理範圍內，個人認為是各有優缺點啦，因人而異吧！
優點就菜色好吃，餐廳氣氛不錯
缺點就是熱餐等比較久，加上剛剛沒有說到的，坐比較裡面的話網路收訊會超級差。
比較適合朋友和情侶，不太適合個人用餐","I was found on the Internet. I want to say that I just went to eat on vacation today. Anyway, I also live nearby. I went in and ordered at almost nine o'clock. I took a special look. I ordered the cheese Shushu and smoked duck breasts. Just two times, I waited for an hour. In fact, I wanted to tell him that I would wait for too long. I want to leave. Is it delicious to send it up?I continue to wait. After sending it on the table, the dishes are not bad. The cheese Shullele is very fragrant, but if I put a pepper or salt next to it, I think it will be full, and the duck breasts are delicious. I think they are all within the reasonable range of the price. Personally, I think it has its own advantages and disadvantages, it varies from person to person!
The advantages are delicious, the restaurant atmosphere is good
The disadvantage is that the hot meal is so long. In addition, if you have n’t mentioned it, the online receipt will be super worse if you sit in it.
More suitable for friends and couples, not very suitable for personal meals"
"CP值超高的餐酒館。
各種日本酒（清酒、燒酌、梅酒）搭配義式料理。
酒的種類很多可以選擇。
餐點美味好吃。","CP -high dining tavern.
Various Japanese wine (sake, roasted, plum wine) with righteous dishes.
There are many types of wine to choose from.
The meal is delicious."
"很有氣氛的一家小酒館，現場雖然菜品不多，但是搭配店裡的紅酒、白酒、啤酒應該都是恰到好處。
點了一個鯷魚的，有點驚艷，魚肉肉質很嫩，調味適當，配白酒讚讚，滿推薦成為約會地點！","A very atmospheric tavern. Although there are not many dishes on the scene, it should be just right with red wine, white wine, and beer in the store.
I ordered a catfish, which is a bit amazing. The fish meat is very tender, the seasoning is appropriate, and the flavor is praised. It is recommended to become a dating place!"
"店家離捷運行天宮站步行大約5-7分鐘，不算遠，但位在巷內，比較不好找。店內供應日本酒（清酒、燒酎、梅酒）及日本啤酒。餐食則是義式為主，中西混搭但是相當契合！價位中等，若有點餐及點酒，人均消費在700元以上。缺點是店內位置不多，除了有一張沙發外，其餘是吧台以及兩人坐的高腳椅，坐起來不算舒適，不太適合多人聚餐。

補敘：我太太懷孕過程中，一直很懷念心白的義式料理及氣氛，我想帶她來回味，但店家直接表達不歡迎孕婦（見對話截圖；沒座位就沒座位，不懂為何加了不適合小孩與孕婦的敘述，心白明明賣很多吃的料理呀）。對於女性而言不是很友善的一間店呢！","The store walks about 5-7 minutes away from the MRT Tiangong Station. It is not far away, but it is not easy to find in the alley.The store is supplied to Japanese wine (sake, roasted, plum wine) and Japanese beer.The meal is Italian -based, Mixed -match between China and the West, but it is quite fit!The price is medium. If you have some meals and wine, the per capita consumption is more than 700 yuan.The disadvantage is that there are not many locations in the store. Except for a sofa, the rest is the bar and the high chair where the two sitting. It is not comfortable to sit up and it is not suitable for multi -person dinner.

Make -up: In the process of pregnancy, my wife has always missed the white Italian cuisine and atmosphere. I want to take her back and forth, but the store directly expresses that I do n’t welcome pregnant women (see the screenshot of the dialogue; It is not suitable for children and pregnant women, and Xinbai Mingming sells a lot of food).It is not a very friendly shop for women!"
環境舒適，酒類、義大利麵都蠻好吃，但價格偏高、份量少。,"The environment is comfortable, the alcohol and pasta are all delicious, but the price is high and the portion is small."
入店時店員顧著跟朋友聊天，我們自己找位置，同時被告知有低消一杯酒，酒品在牆上，完全沒有要服務的感覺，沒有介紹沒有水，沒有服務只有擺臉色的樣子，服務費10%，純喝酒的客人,"When entering the store, the clerk took care of friends and we found the location by ourselves. At the same time, we were informed that there was a low cup of wine. The wine was on the wall. There was no feeling of service at all. The service fee is 10%, the guests who drink pure drink"

"氣氛好，清酒種類多，價格中高，
餐點普通，喝酒好地方","The atmosphere is good, there are many types of sake, and the price is high.
Ordinary meals, good places to drink"
南瓜燉飯味道濃郁香甜，但店家推薦的清酒香氣口味並沒有被吃掉，反而相輔相成。店內整體氛圍相當不錯，交通也方便，值得常來喝一杯。,"Pumpkin stewed rice is rich and sweet, but the aroma taste recommended by the store has not been eaten, but it complements each other.The overall atmosphere in the store is quite good, and the transportation is also convenient. It is worth drinking a drink often."
"大推！
清酒單杯價格很可以
選擇也很多
環境舒適","Push!
Sake single cup price is very good
There are also a lot of choices

"點了油封鴨腿但沒給刀子，要了刀子後發現切不動，詢問了店家是否可以幫忙切 或是示範一下怎麼切，得到的答案是：請用手拿起來啃。
結果留評論反應後 被店家反酸不會用刀子？！
（剛剛明明就詢問了怎麼切 是你們叫客人拿起來啃的耶）
回到店裡說明原委，還被老闆嗆說：說完了？可以離開了嗎？
沒遇過這麼不講道理的店家，相信這篇評論一定也會被老闆回覆，只是想讓大家知道店家態度很糟糕：）真的不需要花錢買氣受！

補充：店員告知我們說 所有的客人都是用啃的哦～ 原來所有的客人都不會用刀～ 還是老闆活在自己的世界裡：） 真心感謝google的公開評論制，可以讓沒來過的人防雷😉","I ordered the oil sealing duck leg but did not give the knife. After asking the knife, I found that I couldn't move. I asked if the store could help cut or demonstrate how to cut it. The answer was: please pick up with your hands.
As a result, after the reaction of the comments, will the store be sour and won't use a knife?Intersection
(I just asked how to cut it, how you told the guests to pick it up)
Back to the store to explain the original committee, and the boss said: After finishing speaking?Can I leave?
I have never encountered such an unreasonable shop, I believe that this comment will definitely be replied by the boss, but I just want everyone to know that the store's attitude is bad :) I really don't need to spend money to buy it!

Supplement: The clerk told us that all the guests were using it ~ All the guests would not use a knife ~ or the boss lived in his own world :) I really thank Google's public comment system, so that I can let the one who has never been here can not come before Renren"

店內除了氣泡水，都是有酒精飲料，一人基銷一杯酒，蠻多酒單選擇。

海膽燉飯配大生蠔好吃，海膽味濃郁。
奶油干貝鮭魚寬版義大利麵好吃，奶油夠濃稠巴著寬麵。感覺蠻常變動菜色，每次去可點到不同東西，大部分是要配酒的料理，口味會相較鹹的感覺。

店內適合2~4人座位，其中兩個4人座比鄰可成8人座。喜歡店裡聲浪不高，不需要大聲說話，反而比較擔心我們一群人吵到別人，都是好人客。

比較特別的是酒單在一面牆上，在看點什麼酒時，跟坐在牆邊的客人面面相覷，小尷尬。

適合慢食輕聲慢聊慢慢來~","2023/11/24
In addition to bubble water in the store, there are alcoholic beverages. One -person sells a glass of wine, and there are quite a lot of wine lists.

Sea urchin stewed rice with big oysters is delicious, and sea urchin has a strong flavor.
Cream scalloped salmon wide version of the pasta is delicious, and the cream is thick enough.It feels like changing dishes often. Each time you go to different things, most of them are dishes with wine, and the taste will feel more salty.

The store is suitable for 2 to 4 people, and two of them can be eight.I like the store in the store, and there is no need to speak loudly. Instead, we are more worried that a group of people are noisy to others. They are all good and guests.

The more special thing is that the wine list is on the wall. When you look at the wine, you look at the guests sitting by the wall, which is embarrassed.

Suitable for slow food and slowly, slow slowly ~"
"店家沒有錯，錯的是我不該在情人節選這家
鮭魚麵好吃，但偏貴
比較不好的地方是鴨腿粉紅醬麵600元一份
韌且不好啃，整隻上來沒刀具，要了餐刀發現切不動，請店家協助，店家表示用啃的…
女生啃的滿臉漲紅我很抱歉
本來打算喝到滿意再離開，但我實在沒臉繼續留著
給其他人建議或許店家專注在他想專注的地方，但對客人的心情是真的沒興趣

補充：我只請店家協助切肉沒有要剁骨，老闆把自己當菜市場肉販噢⋯⋯

對 這裡是酒吧，不該點吃的","The store is not wrong.
Salmon noodles are delicious, but it's expensive
The bad place is the duck leg pink sauce noodle 600 yuan a copy
Toughness and difficulty, there is no knife 具 in the whole. I asked the knife to find that I couldn't move. Please ask the store to help.
The girl's face flushed, I'm sorry
I planned to drink until I was satisfied and then left, but I really have no face to keep keeping
Suggestion for others Perhaps the store focuses on where he wants to focus, but the mood of the guests is really not interested

Added: I only invite the store to help cut the meat and do not want to chop bone.

Yes, it is a bar, you shouldn't order it"
點的清酒跟梅酒都不錯喝，但是價位算高,"Ordered sake and plum wine are good, but the price is high"
"老闆是個溫柔而且感受到對日本酒有滿滿愛〜
大力推薦給想喝好喝清酒的饕客😎🍻🙌
店內平日不算吵鬧也沒有酒醉客人
清酒單一週會換一次‼老闆都會仔細介紹‼
喝起來很順很順然後就各種忍不住😂
漬物跟火腿拼盤也都超級下酒","The boss is gentle and feels full of love for Japanese wine ~
Vigorously recommend it to the customer who wants to drink a good sake 😎🍻🙌 😎🍻🙌 😎🍻🙌 😎🍻🙌 😎🍻🙌 😎🍻🙌 😎🍻🙌
The store is not noisy or drunk guests on weekday
Will change the sake once a week 周 周 周 周The boss will introduce it carefully
After drinking it smoothly, I can't help but can't help it.
The stains and ham platter are also super wine"
週週換新酒單，餐點好吃，氣氛輕鬆，非常適合與好友相約一起，吃吃喝喝～,"Zhou Zhou changed the new wine list, the meal is delicious, the atmosphere is easy, it is very suitable for meeting with friends, eating and drinking ~"
食物很好吃，雖然是日式酒吧，食物融合義式日式和中式，不過上菜速度比較慢～,"The food is delicious, although it is a Japanese -style bar, the food fusion of Italian style Japanese and Chinese style, but the speed of serving is relatively slow ~"
"店家態度不敢恭維
進店後完全不會招呼客人，也不會介紹酒
也沒有提供任何服務卻收服務費10%

看到店家回覆後 更加覺得一次店
喝過這麼多間bar和餐酒館
唯獨這間不予置評
難怪生意也不怎麼樣 不敢恭維 呵～","The attitude of the store dare not compliment
After entering the store, I will not say hello to the guests, nor will I introduce the wine
It did not provide any service but received 10% of the service fee

After seeing the store reply, I feel more at a time
I have drank so many BAR and dining tavern
Only this is not commented
No wonder the business is not very good, dare not compliment ~"
烤魟魚意外的口感，日本酒也很推薦！會再來吃其他主餐！,"The unexpected taste of roasted catfish, Japanese wine is also recommended!Will come to eat other main meals!"
"對於收一成服務費沒問題
但一杯水也沒上
對酒的介紹也沒有
一句話說酒就在牆上
這樣的服務實在沒達到給一成服務費的價值","No problem with the service fee
But a glass of water is not on
There is no introduction to wine
In a word, wine is on the wall
Such a service really does not reach the value of the service fee for 10 %"
低cp值餐飲、低水準服務，想體驗吃飯暴怒？跟老闆對罵？歡迎體驗😁祝老闆生意興隆，永保安康！保重身體，龍年行大運。 …,"Low CP dining dining, low -level services, want to experience meal anger?Scolding the boss?Welcome to experience 😁 I wish the boss for a prosperous business and permanent security!Take care of the body, the Dragon of the Dragon.Mowing"
餐點每一樣都很好吃，還能夠喝到很多不同種類的日本酒，約會推薦💕 …,"Every time the meal is delicious, you can also drink a lot of different types of Japanese wine."
"完全不理客人
東西很不合口味","Ignore the guests at all
Things are very inconsistent"
"還不錯

不過不太熟悉日本酒的朋友可能有點...","not bad

But friends who are not familiar with Japanese wine may be a bit ..."
很優秀的店，餐點跟酒都很棒，清酒很多選擇,"Very good shop, meals and wine are great, sake of sake a lot of options"
很好吃 CP值高 不過最近一兩次去都沒開@@,"Very delicious CP value is high, but I haven’t opened it in the last or twice time @@"

"爛。店員態度非常隨便又差。
我路過從外面看感覺不錯進去喝一杯。當時店內只有一桌客人，並不忙。店員沒有招呼，就一直在跟自己的朋友聊天。我詢問酒的介紹時聽起來隨便又不耐煩，只是像應付我的講了幾個字介紹。買單時還收10%服務費，我到底哪裡被服務到了？不懂。

看了其他人的評論下面店家有回覆，好想覺得自己是賣酒的店所以不在乎服務。既然這樣，那酒應該能好好介紹吧？ 既然不在乎服務那收什麼服務費？","rotten.The clerk's attitude is very casual and bad.
I passed by and looked good from outside. I went in a drink.At that time, there was only one table guest in the store and was not busy.The clerk did not say hello, he had been chatting with his friends.When I asked the wine introduction, it sounded casually and impatient, but just like dealing with me a few words.When I bought the bill, I received a 10%service fee. Where did I get the service?don't know.

After reading the other people's comments, the store has a reply below. I really want to think that I am a shop that sells wine so I don't care about the service.In this case, should the wine be introduced well?Since you don't care about the service, what service fees do you charge?"
專業的清酒吧，食物也美味$$😍 …,"Professional sake bars, food is also delicious $ $ 😍 ..."
非常適合三兩好友小酌的地方,It is very suitable for three or two friends to drink
餐點跟酒的價格合理,The price of meals and wine is reasonable
"第一次去一間令人不知所措的店，在朋友推薦下想回味在日本小酌的滋味。
一開始詢問是否有訂位，回答沒有後，店家指著一張桌子叫我們可以坐那邊後就空氣一片凝結；初次來訪的客人不懂店裡點餐流程，還以為是否我們突如其來的打擾不對！？
廚房師傅做的餐點很美味，酒也是很好喝，更想探索店裡各種日本酒。
但真的，謝謝！不會二訪，如果只想做熟客，其實可以在門口標示。
網路上寫店家的態度也是蠻多人給予評論，就當我們猶豫是否要加點酒，後來決定結帳，老闆還未回到櫃檯，就看到明細已放置在收銀前桌上，其實觀感很差。","For the first time, I went to the overwhelmed shop, and I wanted to remember the taste of a drink in Japan under the recommendation of my friends.
At first I asked if there was a reservation. After answering, the store pointed at a table and told us that we could sit there and condense the air. IntersectionIntersection
The meals made by the kitchen master are delicious, and the wine is also very delicious. I want to explore various Japanese wine in the store.
But really, thank you!There will be no second visit. If you just want to be a cooked customer, you can actually mark it at the door.
The attitude of writing a store on the Internet also commented on many people. When we hesitated to add some wine, then decided to check the checkout. The boss had not returned to the counter. Essence"
"餐點好吃
清酒的選擇真的很多
氣氛也很不錯
但優點僅止於此。

其中一位捲毛頭髮店員的臭臉完全讓上面的優點失色，
問他什麼問題，
都能用臭臉加簡短回答讓氣氛瞬間凝結，
而且除了上菜外，也要我們主動問有沒有水才給水，
但結帳居然敢收一成服務費，
也是很讓人傻眼…","Meal delicious
There are really many choices for sake
The atmosphere is also very good
But the advantages only stop.

One of the stinky faces of the curly hair shop clerk completely made the advantages of the top,
Ask him what question,
You can use a stinky face and a brief answer to make the atmosphere condense instantly,
And in addition to serving, we must take the initiative to ask if there is any water to give the water.
But dare to charge a 10 % service fee at the checkout,
It's also very dumbfounded ..."
餐點非常好吃 中高價位,The meal is very delicious and high -priced
"餐點很有水準，鱸魚松露燉飯，干貝義大利麵，鴨胸和生蠔都很好吃。鴨胸如果能切薄一點會比較方便客人吃，生蠔新鮮肥美，很對得起一顆兩百的價錢。酒類偏貴。
扣掉的一顆心是因為服務，自己去吧台點餐，自己問酒類產品，站在酒類牆前面沒有要主動介紹或詢問客人想喝那類的（店裡共三組客人其中一組應該已經吃一半了，也不是說非常忙），沒有提供水。希望店家可以更主動一點，畢竟有收10%服務費","The meal points are very standard, herring truffle stew rice, dried mussels, duck breast and oysters are very good.Duck breast if you can cut a little thinner will be more convenient to eat, oysters are fresh and plump, very good for a two hundred price.The alcohol is rather expensive.
Deducts a heart because of the service, to the pub station to order food, ask their own alcohol products, the station in the front of the wine wall stitches to take the initiative to introduce or inquire about the customer's want to drink NagaEat half, also not good to say very busy), the stimmer has provided water.I hope the shop can be a little more proactive, after all, there are 10% service charges"
餐點真的很好吃，老闆人也很好,"The meal is really delicious, and the boss is also very good"
輕鬆喝酒的地方，大推鴨胸超好吃，一定要品嚐限定14代，值得！,"Where you drink easily, push duck breasts is super delicious, you must taste limited 14 generations, it is worth it!"
如果你喜歡喝清酒，這是個好地方，如果你喜歡吃義料，這裡的料理一定不會讓你失望，如果你想來這裡買醉，最晚可以睡到打洋,"If you like to drink sake, this is a good place. If you like to eat meaning, the dishes here will not let you down. If you want to come here to buy drunk, you can sleep at the latest"
"老闆專業廚師有個性
在這邊評五顆星老闆不會理你

白酒鱸魚松露燉飯非常好吃～～～～","The atmosphere is very good
White wine bass truffle stew is very delicious ~~~~"
"一間什麼都好唯獨音樂真的不太行的好店😂。
食物很有特色很好吃、酒的種類非常多可以任君挑選、價格合理、環境也很舒適，但店裡放的流行音樂（例如小賈斯丁的baby跟Lady Gaga的 Poker Face)真的蠻解氣氛的。如果之後店裡能換上比較舒適的音樂的話，整體的氛圍會更令人嚮往的👍🏻 …","There is a good shop that is really good at everything.

"孕婦不友善餐廳

商家堅持要每人一杯酒精飲料當低消
且商家也沒有提供無酒精調酒
服務態度也讓人十分不舒服","Pregnant women are not friendly restaurants

Merchants insist on a cup of alcoholic beverages per person to disappear
And the merchant did not provide alcohol -free refined alcohol
The service attitude is also very uncomfortable"
這裡不是孕婦不友善餐廳，但這裡有低消酒水的規則。這裡不是歧視女性主義的餐廳，但這裡絕對歧視奧客。,"This is not a non -friendly restaurant for pregnant women, but there are rules of low alcohol.This is not a restaurant that is discriminating against feminism, but it is absolutely discriminated against Austrian."
有水準，master功力高，搭配餐點的酒很對味。,"There is a standard, Master's skills are high, and the wine with meals is very right."
這是我去過最棒的店！下次一定還要再去！酒很棒，隔天沒有甚麼副作用。（葡萄糖）,"This is the best shop I have been!I will definitely go again next time!The wine is great, and there are no side effects the next day.(glucose)"
氣氛好的清酒餐館,Sake restaurant with good atmosphere
晚上放鬆心情的好地方，有不同的單杯清酒酒單並時常更換，用義式料理搭配也別有風味，年輕的老闆本身對清酒很有熱誠，可以和他聊聊清酒或是聽他講清酒和酒廠的故事。,"Relax in a good place at night, there are different single cups of sake liquor and often replace it. It is also unique to the combination of Italian dishes. The young boss is very enthusiastic about sake. You can talk to him about sake or listen to him to clear sake and sake and clear sake and sake. The story of the winery."
"單杯清酒的形式很方便
適合各種族群
尤其適合初嚐或是喜歡新鮮感
東西也好吃
很real的一家店","The form of a single cup of sake is very convenient
Suitable for various ethnic groups
Especially suitable for first taste or like freshness
Things are so delicious

"希望那位留言餐酒館是孕婦不友善餐廳的腦羞仔
他的可憐小孩可以回到天上去 不要被這種人生出來
不然他的人生鐵定很可憐","I hope that the message and tavern is the shame of the pregnant woman's not friendly restaurant
His poor child can go back to the sky and don't be out of such a life
Otherwise, his life is very pitiful"
好吃好喝的清酒店，價位中上，如果不知道喜歡的口味可以問問bartender（老闆）的意見，覺得一次可以喝到各種sake就是開心❤️,"The delicious and delicious hotel, the price is in the price, if you don't know the taste you like"
"食物好吃，但蚊子多到打死一隻還有其他隻，坐不到一小時就趕緊吃一吃閃人，因為一邊腳上就被蚊子叮滿11個胞腫到不像話，可能疫情期間沒什麼人所以蚊子特多吧，但也是要做好環境清潔。

5/27晚上","The food is delicious, but there are more mosquitoes to kill one and there is another. After sitting for an hour, eat and eat a flash, because it is swollen by the mosquito on the side of the feet. No one, so there are so many mosquitoes, but also to do a good job of environmental cleaning.

5/27 evening"
平日晚上客人不多，氣氛很舒服，餐點推跟酒飲都不錯，很適合跟朋友好好聚會聊聊天的地方。,"There are not many guests on weekdays, the atmosphere is very comfortable, and the meal is good to push with wine and drink. It is very suitable for a good place to chat with friends."
"剛剛去 服務生態度真的很差勁
從我們進門開始
他也都沒來引導位置還離我們超遠的說：指著邊邊的位置 說：你個做邊邊
一句什麼歡迎光臨都沒說
接下來又說 菜單在牆壁自己看

點完餐了 又說 我們有低消 要點酒
於是在他愛回不回的狀況下
我們直接走人

我只是想說不管東西好吃或者難吃
你們的服務態度跟本超有問題好嗎","I just went to the service ecosystem is really bad
Start from we enter the door
He didn't come to guide the position and said it was very far away from us: point to the side of the side and say: You are the edge of the side
I didn’t say anything in a word.
Next, I said that the menu watch it on the wall by itself

After ordering the meal, we also say that we have a low cord and order wine
So in the case where he loves back
We go directly

I just want to say that no matter what is delicious or unpalatable
Is your service attitude and the problem with this super?"
酒不錯喝但出餐速度極慢，流程也有問題，後點的餐全上了，但7:00店點的餐等到8:15仍在製作，另外低消不含餐，而是每人一杯酒的規定未提早告知，對不喝飲品的朋友來說非常不有善！,"The wine is good to drink but the meal is extremely slow, and there is a problem with the process. The regulations of the wine have not been notified early, and it is very good for friends who don't drink drinks!"
太好吃了，吃過一次就無法忘懷,"It's so delicious, I can't forget it once after eating"
五顆星給喜歡喝清酒的人。食物的部分只給四顆星，但還是美味。,"Five stars are for people who like to drink sake.The food part is only given four stars, but it is still delicious."
單杯價格實惠，老闆品味不錯，酒款和品飲方式都解釋得相當到位，難得安靜氣味也乾淨的bar，整體氣氛讓品飲體驗大大加分！,"The price of a single cup is affordable, the boss tastes good, the wine and the way of drinking are quite well explained, and the rare and quiet smell is also clean. The overall atmosphere makes the drinking experience greatly add points!"
"這裡的餐點好吃~ 酒也好喝!! 雖然製作可能稍微久一點點, 但非常用心~ 等的時間就多喝幾杯吧^^ 不喝酒的人就給我回家睡覺!!","The meals here are delicious ~ The wine is also delicious! Although the production may be a little longer, it is very attentive ~ I will drink a few more cups when I wait for ^^ People who do n’t drink, give me home to sleep !!"

是一個什麼都開心，但會讓錢包傷心的地方XD","The cooking is delicious!The wine is delicious!
It's a place where everything is happy, but it will make the wallet sad XD"
"太令人驚豔的餐點，點什麼好吃什麼，無浮誇！
燉飯、麵類、薯條...都太好吃了！
環境舒適，座位不多，低消為一杯酒。","Too stunning meals, what are the delicious and exaggerated!
Stew rice, noodles, fries ... it's so delicious!
The environment is comfortable, the seats are not many, and the low consumed is a glass of wine."
"店員態度偏冷漠 椅子頗小頗硬
清酒選擇不多
Logo蠻好看的","The clerk's attitude is very indifferent chair is quite small
There are not many choices of sake
Logo pretty good"
燉飯好吃酒也不貴，本來想私藏但看不過去只好來補血了。,"It is not expensive to stew rice. I wanted to hide it in private, but I could n’t see it. I had to come to replenish blood."
幫補血，其實可以點兩杯酒精飲品給另一個人喝啊wwwww很難嗎？,"Help blood, in fact, you can order two cups of alcoholic drinks for another person wwwww is it difficult?"

餐點超級鹹，出餐速度霹靂無敵慢，服務人員連我們入座後，都沒有解釋如何點餐，還要我們去問！這樣還要收服務費？！會不會太扯！打死我也不會再光顧,"The meal was super salty, the meal was so fast that the service staff did not even explain how to order after the seat of us, and we asked us to ask!Do you need to charge the service fee?IntersectionWill it be too tumbling!I won't visit if I kill it"
很精緻的餐酒館，很適合跟朋友小聚，尤其適合想要品嘗清酒的人，可以點單杯，一個人來也可以。,"The delicate dining tavern is very suitable for friends with friends, especially suitable for those who want to taste sake, you can order a single cup, you can also come alone."
低消飲品，酒類以清酒為主但各類選擇各有一些。重點：餐超好吃 (天啊這個海膽燉飯),"Low drinks, alcohols are mainly sake but various choices.Key points: meals are so delicious (Oh my sea urchin stew rice)"
菜色特別，店員會細心的介紹當期的推薦酒款，氣氛非常不錯，適合聚餐也適合一個人小酌。,The dishes are special. The clerk will carefully introduce the current recommendation of wine. The atmosphere is very good. It is suitable for dinner and it is suitable for people to drink alone.
餐點非常驚艷！和吧台(應該是是老闆？)聊就很盡興，若對日本酒有興趣，這是不要錯過的好地方～,"The meal is very amazing!He is a boss (should be the boss?) Talking is very happy. If you are interested in Japanese wine, this is a good place to miss it ~"

松露燉飯、南瓜燉飯跟起司拼盤都很有水準，室內空間舒服，酒類選擇多，也都還不錯,"Tulu stewed rice, pumpkin stewed rice and cheese platter are very standard, the indoor space is comfortable, there are many alcohol choices, and they are not bad."
有很多的清酒種類可以選擇，燉飯也很好吃，喜歡店內優閒放鬆的氛圍。,"There are many types of sake to choose from, stewed rice is also delicious, and like the atmosphere of leisurely and relaxing in the store."
可以推出隨意做的酒水特調嗎 名稱就叫無知與傲慢,Can the name of the random wine be launched? The name is ignorant and arrogant

I still remember the reason why this place was when I first came in 2019."
"食物整體來說很一般，松露薯條的得分很高。
我們坐在門口，整個晚餐都出汗了，空調的情況需要認真改善。
上菜的速度也可以快一點。","Food is very ordinary as a whole, and truffle fries are very high.
We sat at the door, sweating throughout the dinner, and the situation of the air conditioner needs to be carefully improved.
The speed of serving can also be faster."
"這是一家很棒的酒吧，提供台灣美味且著名的日本清酒😸
我沒有吃這頓飯，因為這是我去的第二頓飯，但是
我吃了用酒糟製成的乳酪，味道鮮美，與清酒很相配。
酒吧老闆對日本酒也非常了解，這是一家非常好的酒吧。","This is a great bar, which provides Taiwan's delicious and famous Japanese sake 😸
I didn’t eat this meal because this is my second meal, but
I ate cheese made of lees, delicious, and matched with sake.
The bar owner also knows Japanese wine very well. This is a very good bar."
日本清酒的天堂，運氣很好，當天到貨的清酒真澄，味道十分不錯，喜歡日本清酒的首選店,"The paradise of Japanese sake, good luck, the sake that arrives on the same day is really good, the taste is very good, I like the preferred shop of Japanese sake"
小吃很美味。牆上寫著很多簽名，可能是因為有很多日本釀酒師參加。座位不多，所以去之前先查一下。,"The snack is delicious.Many signatures are written on the wall, probably because many Japanese winemakers participated.There are not many seats, so check it before going."
"這就是你想去的地方。安靜的。複雜的。友好的工作人員。令人難以置信的酒吧小吃。有史以來最大、最美味的牡蠣。還有美味的布里起司。非常適合一邊品嚐我喝過的最好的清酒。

如果您在該地區並且喜歡清酒，那麼這裡就是您該去的地方。","This is where you want to go.Quietly.Complex.Friendly staff.Unbelievable bar snacks.The largest and most delicious oyster ever ever.There are also delicious Bridge cheese.It is very suitable to taste the best sake I have drank while drinking.

If you like sake in the area, then here is where you should go."
來清飯店試飲生啤酒很有趣，空間小巧，但吧檯椅坐起來不是很舒服⋯⋯,"It is fun to come to the hotel to try raw beer, small space, but the table chair is not very comfortable to sit up."
非常舒適和友好的地方。美味的食物，美味的清酒，愉快的服務😀,"Very comfortable and friendly place.Delicious food, delicious sake, pleasant service 😀"
喜歡這家位於安靜街道一側的小清酒酒吧。牆上有菜單，上面有不同類型的清酒選項。也可以問調酒師，他會給你一些好的建議。,"Like this small bartender bar on the side of the quiet street.There is a menu on the wall with different types of sake options.You can also ask the winemaker, he will give you some good suggestions."
整體來說，份量小，價格貴（CP值低），不過扇貝義大利麵還蠻好吃的。,"Overall, the portion is small, the price is expensive (the CP value is low), but the scallops are pretty delicious."
老闆推薦的生原酒好喝，米的香甜味濃鬱，容易上手。東西口味也不錯，波隆納義大利麵醬汁跟麵條搭配剛好，炸海鮮食材新鮮，炸黑橄欖花枝丸口感實在，香氣濃鬱。不過份量有一點點少，要吃飽可能要多點幾道菜。,"The raw wine recommended by the boss is delicious, the sweetness of the rice is rich, and it is easy to get started.The taste of things is also good. Polonine's pasta sauce and noodles are just right. The fried seafood ingredients are fresh. The fried black olive flower branches pills are real and have a strong aroma.However, there is a little bit less, and a few more dishes may be a little bit more."
義大利調味飯真的很好吃，不同類型的梅酒都很美味。不幸的是，服務生對朋友比對顧客更友善。,"Italian seasonings are really delicious, and different types of plum wines are delicious.Unfortunately, waiters are more friendly to friends than customers."
時尚的日本清酒酒吧。小吃很好吃。,Fashionable Japanese sake bar.The snack is delicious.
好爽,So cool
我去那裡的時候沒有人，清酒的選擇很棒，食物對我付的錢來說相當一般，氣氛很糟糕，儘管調酒師對清酒有豐富的知識，但不知道如何與顧客互動，我不會回來。,"There is no one when I go there. The choice of sake is great. The food is quite average for the money I paid. The atmosphere is bad. Although the bartender has a rich knowledge about the sake of sake, I don’t know how to interact with the customer. Will come back."
位於小巷裡的有趣的清酒酒吧。根據季節精選的清酒。調酒師知識淵博，能夠推薦適合您的清酒。,"Interesting bartender bar in the alley.Depending on the seasons selected sake.The alcoholic knowledge is profound, and you can recommend sake that suits you."
提供單杯一些獨特的清酒和葡萄酒。也推薦瓶裝清酒的選擇,Provide a single cup of unique sake and wine.I also recommend the choice of bottled sake
清酒的選擇非常多，他們的食物也很棒。,"There are many choices for sake, and their food is also great."
晚上的時尚酒吧，氣氛柔和，但常常空無一人。,"The fashion bar at night, the atmosphere is soft, but it is often empty."
