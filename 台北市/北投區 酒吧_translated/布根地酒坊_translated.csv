環境幽美，隱藏在巷弄的紅酒專門店👍對於喜愛紅酒的族群無疑是個非常雅緻的空間^_^第一次來到這家店就深深被店內綠色庭院花花草草給吸引。通常店家都禁止帶外食，但這家店可以接受消費者帶自己喜愛的食物進來填肚子，但禁止外帶外面的酒類，非常合理👍超棒的～強力推薦🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"The environment is beautiful, and the red wine specialty store hidden in the alley is undoubtedly a very elegant space for the ethnic group of red wine^_^The first time I came to this store, I was deeply attracted by the green courtyard in the store.Usually the stores are prohibited from bringing out food, but this store can accept consumers to bring their favorite food in filling their stomachs, but it is very reasonable to prohibit the outer alcohol."
瘋狂吸菸、半夜大小聲吵雜擾民，當這邊的人隔天不用上班嗎,"Crazy smoking and disturbing the people in the middle of the night, do people here do n’t need to go to work the next day?"
吵雜的店，超過十點還是一直製造噪音,"The noisy shop, more than ten o'clock, still make noise"
他們提供的勃根地葡萄酒可能是台北最合理的價格，還有一些波爾多葡萄酒和美國葡萄酒。如果您喜歡勃根地，那麼這裡就是您的最佳選擇。您可以在酒吧喝酒（不需要額外付費使用漂亮的玻璃杯），也可以帶回家享用。強烈推薦這個地方！,"The rooted wine they provided may be the most reasonable price of Taipei, as well as some Bordeaux and American wine.If you like Big Gen, then here is your best choice.You can drink in a bar (you don't need to pay for additional glass cups), or you can take it home to enjoy.Recommend this place strongly!"
勃根地葡萄酒價格非常優惠,Bettanic wine price is very favorable
對於喜歡勃根地的人來說，這是一個完美的地方！,This is a perfect place for people who like Biggen!!
好吧，這很友善。,"Well, this is very friendly."
