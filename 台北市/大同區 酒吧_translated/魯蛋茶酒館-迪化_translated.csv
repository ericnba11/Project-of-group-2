"難得在這遇見帥哥Bartender！

店內裝潢設計燈光音樂讓整體環境顯得輕鬆舒服，適合朋友一起來聊天放鬆。星期六晚上12點到時，已經沒有任何餐點只剩下飲品。菜單文案寫得不錯，但調酒喝起來很一般，洋甘菊茶竟然有苦味，沒有應該有的香氣或甘味，感覺是品質很差的洋甘菊來源。,"The interior decoration design of the store makes the overall environment easily comfortable, suitable for friends to chat and relax.At 12 o'clock on Saturday, there is no meal for only drinks.The menu copywriting is well written, but the bartending is very ordinary.

"因為是老屋改建而來的店面，相當有復古氣氛，而且建築名稱叫「春風得意樓」很有趣！看店家FB上有許多在此拍古裝美照的照片，算是外拍名店吧。

酒的種類很多種，但動作很慢，而且酒實在很弱又普通……我自己說弱可能不準，畢竟我也喝得有點強度了，但同行的普通人友人也說酒感不強，那應該就不是我的幻覺了。

總之，喝個兩杯後我就放棄在這裡買醉了。不過老屋的確很有特色，還是值得一訪。","Because it is a store converted from the old house, there is a retro atmosphere, and the architectural name is ""Spring Breeze Promoting Building"" is very interesting!There are a lot of photos of the costumes of the costumes on the store FB. It is considered a famous shop.

There are many types of wine, but the movements are very slow, and the wine is very weak and ordinary ... I say that weakness may not be accurate, after all, I also drink a little intensity, but ordinary friends who peers also say that the wine is not strong. That should not be my hallucination.

"台北的隱藏景點！

魯蛋茶酒館除了賣酒，同時有展示老闆的木雕作品，也有販售，有興趣可以跟吧台詢問。至於為什麼叫做『魯蛋』，是因為老闆初戀喜歡的女生就叫做魯蛋。酒吧空間是挑高的長方形，一邊是吧台一邊很有客棧的感覺；酒館門口既是抽煙區也是自助區，一旁的誠實冰箱有果汁、啤酒、七喜和礦泉水等等可以購買，而良心無價。
在保全百年古蹟的前提下，老闆以自己的木雕作品裝飾裡裡外外，小至牆上掛的雕版，大至桌椅。

12/24晚上，點了一壺烏龍茶（只有一小撮茶葉，泡了約10分鐘才有很淡的茶色）和三樣餐點（老周八醬飯、鮮蝦水餃、牛肉麵），前後約40分鐘才上齊，最後上的牛肉麵，麵條只有7-8分熟（當我吃牛排？），還有不少黏成團，因拖了太久肚餓，又不想浪費，只好硬着頭皮吃完，看來此店不適合供餐,"On the evening of 12/24, I ordered a pot of oolong tea (only a handful of tea leaves, and for about 10 minutes to have a very light tea color) and three meals (Lao Sae sauce rice, fresh shrimp dumplings, beef noodles), before and after It is only about 40 minutes.

在迪化街閒逛，誤打誤撞進來了這間老宅改建的茶酒館，聽說是第一天營業的二館，因爲初進入對老宅空間的驚豔，決定坐下來喝一杯度過輕鬆的周五夜晚。但真要入坐才發現空間設計地很不友善，僅兩座是布沙發，且都屬多人座位，兩人或四人座都是很硬像教室桌椅一樣。但既來之則安之，還是硬找個位子坐下來，點了調酒，味道還不錯，但令人驚訝的是，酒送上來超陽春的，沒有一點擺設或裝置，沒有水果片小雨傘啥的，甚至連杯墊都沒有，搞得桌子都是水漬，拿起杯來喝（因爲也沒吸管），滴得腿都是水。落漆！金玉其外。是我唯一感想。可惜了這麼好的一個老宅。不過服務人員態度都很好，算是唯一優點吧。,"Wandering on Dihua Street, I accidentally hit the tea restaurant reconstructed by the old house. I heard that it was the second hall that was opened on the first day. Because I first entered the stunning of the old house space, I decided to sit down and drink a cup and spend it easy for it to make it easier to spend it easy. Friday night.However, I really have to sit in and find that the space design is very unfriendly. Only two are sofas, and both are multiplayer seats. Both or four people are very hard like classroom tables and chairs.But when it comes, it is peaceful, but I still find a seat to sit down and order the bartender.

"白天賣米，入夜後面開酒吧。
週六七點左右店裡沒什麼客人，原本想說來邊用個電腦放鬆一下，只點了兩杯便宜的咖啡，沒想到八點半左右突然湧入了兩三群人，瞬間塞滿整個空間，實在有點不好意思霸佔這麼久的位子。

這裡的咖啡還行，氣氛很不錯，最重要的是入夜後會有 DJ Live Performance 放類 Techno、Deep House、EDM 的音樂（OMG，我才花 140 有這種享受太棒了吧...），唯一可惜的是音響設備看起來雖好，但音場不太行，感覺只有沙發區能感受到 Top Experience。

最後，店員蠻友善的，因為菸抽完了，距離便利商店又有一段路，就免費給了我們兩支 Marlboro。Tks。","Sell ​​rice during the day and open a bar after night.
There were no guests in the store around 7 o'clock on Saturday. I originally wanted to use a computer to relax. I only ordered two cups of cheap coffee. I did not expect that two or three groups of people suddenly poured into at about 8:30, and the entire space was stuffed in an instant. It was a bit embarrassed to dominate the seat for so long.

The coffee here is okay, and the atmosphere is very good. The most important thing is that after the night, there will be DJ Live Performance. Techno, Deep House, EDM's music (OMG, I only spend 140 with this enjoyment ...) The only pity is that the audio equipment looks good, but the sound field is not very good.
