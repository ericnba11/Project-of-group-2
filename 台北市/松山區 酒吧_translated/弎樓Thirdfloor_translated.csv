"在跟朋友聚餐時，我常會開發一些沒去過的店去嚐鮮，初來弎樓老實說我有被嚇到，店外沒有招牌，站在店外時會找一下，只看到一家”香鋪”或者宮廟？入店則是驚喜連連，整間完全是復古老宅重，加上昏黃燈光、斑駁的紅磗牆、洗石子地板、廚房的大灶、超陡的樓梯、舊式的木頭𥦬戶、90年代明星海報、牆上爬滿了藤蔓，啊就是我鄉下阿嬤家啊～
二樓則是一間間大小風格不一的包廂，我們只有三個人，被安排在最小的一間，看的出來這間原本是廁所⋯
菜單是一塊木板，上面大多是特色家常菜，口味偏重適合下飯，酒單走一個每個字你都看的懂但莫名其妙的風格，也看不出基酒但很有創意，喜歡嚐鮮的人可以試試，總結來說很有趣的一家店，也很容易在店裡迷路。","When I dinner with my friends, I often develop some stores I have never been to try. When I first came to Laulou, I honestly said that I was scared. There was no signboard outside the store. When I was standing outside the store, I would find it. Shop ""or palace temple?Entering the store is a surprise. The whole room is completely retro old house, plus dim yellow light, mottled red molten wall, stone washing floor, large kitchen stove, super steep staircase, old wooden households, 1990s star poster The wall is covered with vines, ah, my country ’s grandmother's house ~
On the second floor is a box with different sizes. We only have three people and are arranged in the smallest room. It can be seen that this is originally the toilet.
The menu is a piece of wooden board. Most of them are unique and home -cooked dishes. The taste is suitable for meals. You can see the wine list of the wine list. Try, summary a very interesting shop is also easy to get lost in the store.",False
"餐廳門口很像一般住宅，進去之後別有洞天。裝潢舒適又有經典台灣特色。

菜色口感比較偏鹹一點，很下飯，建議配酒或茶更佳。推薦東坡肉、薑絲大腸、金沙絲瓜與蒸蛋，很讚

服務人員Kira態度親切，對餐點也很熟悉，介紹清楚，上菜跟服務也讓人棒，讓第一次來的客人無論點菜或拍照不會茫然。感謝～","The door of the restaurant is very similar to ordinary houses. After entering, don't have a hole.Comfortable decoration and classic Taiwanese characteristics.

薑絲大腸，大腸份量多，酸味夠不死鹹，口感好。

弎樓小炒，五花肉條炸的很乾不油膩，份量少了點，但是好吃。

紹興炒牛肉，牛肉份量多，好吃下飯。

酥炸軟殼蟹，類似避風塘作法，不油，乾爽好吃。

古早味雞卷，雞卷中規中舉，厚實不會軟爛，口感佳。

米粉湯，很大一鍋，建議超過5人在點，湯頭好喝，配料多，好吃。

鳳梨蝦球，蝦球大顆，包裹著蜂蜜芥末的美奶滋，好吃。

皮蛋蝦餅，這道很特別，將皮蛋和豆腐攪碎一起，上面擺肉鬆，口感很好吃。","For the first time today, you must say that the meal surpasses the level of hot fried restaurants. Each is delicious, and the portion is sufficient. The bartender part is a bit too sweet, and the alcohol taste is not enough. This is a pity.

Dinner with reading club partners and discussing books.

The interior decoration and layout style are retro. It is just right with Taiwanese dishes and hot stir -fried dishes. The design of the menu and wine list is also impressive. It means that it has been ordered (it seems that the costume drama emperor chose concubine), and the drink/wine list was a format like a calendar.

"一句話總結：「帶有濃厚民國色彩的中式貴餐廳」，5人$3980，每人平均$800。

因朋友聚會而來，5個女共計5碗飯、5個菜、以及5杯調酒，各項點評如下：

飯：菇飯很有特色，但每碗$30😇

主菜：盤子皆較小，如果是全男生建議以1.5乘以人數（約7.5道菜）較為合適

東坡肉是滷過後炸，滿好吃且有特色的，牛肉則是因為醃過高粱而有淡淡的酒味，其他的像是小炒、時蔬跟鳳梨蝦球都還不錯，但就沒有記憶深刻的點。

調酒：不予置評😇最好喝的大概是妹子酒（酸梅、檸檬），太濃基底的酒反而齁且膩

場地裝潢：復古民國風，還能開電視但超級亮而放棄，桌椅都偏矮（我165都嫌矮），好看但僅是如此。","In a word, it is summarized: ""Chinese -style dining rooms with a strong Republic of China"", 5 people $ 3980, an average of $ 800 per person.

Because of friends' gatherings, 5 women totaling 5 bowls of rice, 5 dishes, and 5 cups of alcohol, the comments are as follows:

Rice: Mushroom rice is very distinctive, but each bowl of $ 30😇

Main cuisine: The plates are small. If it is a whole boy, it is more suitable for the number of boys to multiply with a number of people (about 7.5 dishes)

Dongpo meat is fried after marinated. It is delicious and distinctive. The beef has a faint taste of wine because of the marinated sorghum. The others are pretty good. The point.

Bart -up: Do not comment The best taste is probably the girl wine (sour plum, lemon), but the wine with too thick base is cricket and greasy.

The decoration of the venue: The retro Republic of China can also start a TV, but it is super bright and give up. The tables and chairs are short (I am short), which looks good but just.",False

"店家非常低調，沒有顯目招牌，只有在門口掛燈籠，路過兩次才發現店面位置。內頭的裝潢非常有氣氛，很有1980年代的餐飲店氛圍，而我被安排到一張大圓桌，頭上可見穿堂與矮牆，像極了街頭辦桌感，非常適合聚餐。

不過餐飲除了滑牛肉、金沙絲瓜外，都頗有鹹度，害我水一口接一口，而且上菜速度非常慢，若非有刻意放慢速度吃菜，可能會吃完一道，下一道才會上菜。

至於網路上傳言必點的「東坡肉」根本是災難，東坡肉是要燉到入味與軟嫩，而本店東坡肉卻附上一層脆皮，豬肉不僅沒有味道還十分堅韌難咬。牙口不好的蘇東坡，要是知道世上有這款東坡肉，絕對會氣到從墳墓跳出來。如果真的想搞特色菜，就不要取這種容易讓人誤會的菜名，只會顯得沒有文化。

所以在餐飲這部分，就不要抱持太高期待，反正就是吃個氣氛。雖然我太太吃得很開心，但該據實評論的，就該據實評論。

最後是結帳時，未見商家張貼「本店免開統一發票」，結帳後卻未開統一發票，還只收現金或轉帳。好吧.....既然都敢這樣要求客人了，我就向國稅局檢舉了，ㄏㄏ。","The store is very low -key, there is no significant signboard. Only the lanterns are hung at the door.

However, in addition to the smooth beef and Jinshalig, the catering is quite salty, which harmed me with a sip of the water, and the food is very slow. vegetable.

As for the rumors on the Internet, the ""Dongpo Meat"" must be disaster at all. Dongpo meat is stewed into taste and soft tender, but the Dongpo meat of this shop is attached to a layer of crispy skin.

So in this part of the catering, don't hold too high expectations, anyway, just eat an atmosphere.Although my wife eats very well, it is based on the practical comment.

"很台式復古風格的一間餐酒館，因為店名叫「弎（三）樓」，我下意識一直在找有沒有通往樓上的樓梯，實際一看，原來1樓就是店面了（笑）。食物雖然好吃，但總覺得不道地；酒也不會很強，也具有一定的創意成分。

然後大半年後的某天，友人傳了個新聞連結說這是不是我們去喝過的店，我一看挖靠好像是這間店啊，之後發現店就搬家了；再隔了大半年想起這間店，這才展開了新店之旅。

若說通化街舊店是台式復古風格，延吉街的新店就更復古、簡直就是廢墟毛胚屋了（笑），但裝潢還是處處透著原有的風格，真心佩服店家怎麼找到這種房子的啊。

【清炒時蔬】水蓮
得知本日的青菜是水蓮後當然要吃啊！這可是我的愛菜！還加了破布子，更添滋味，好吃。

【腰果宮保雞丁】
只有看起來像宮保雞丁，吃起來竟然是糖醋風味，雖然加了青椒很好吃，但整個就不是宮保風味的料理。

【宮保雞丁】
跟之前的腰果宮保雞丁有87%像，青椒大塊不少，但這是不是該改名叫糖醋雞丁比較好啊……味道真的不怎麼宮保呢。

【東坡肉】
不同於普通醬滷方式的東坡肉，酥炸的外皮與肥嫩的厚切五花肉，很好吃。

【菇飯】
米粒分明卻又不會太乾的炊飯，很好吃。

【南臺灣小姑娘】
熱情如火的南國小姑娘帶有熱帶水果風味，酒感輕。

【鐵漢柔情】
有被告知過酒感稍重，但我覺得還好。喝得出鐵觀音和威士忌的風味，不賴。

【雨夜花】
從長相到味道都是可爾必思，酒味微乎其微。

【桂花巷】
我一直覺得很神奇，很多用威士忌當基酒的調酒都很沒威士忌味，這杯也是，完全酸酸甜甜又富桂花香，酒感中等偏輕。

【青花椒花生】
頗有Old Fashion的風味，酒感中等微重，邊喝邊配花生，挺有意思。

【烏梅番茄】
感覺是杯帶有些微酒感的糖葫蘆，沒什麼茶感，再搭配杯子上的圖案，頗具童趣。

【Grapes and Le more】
It is simply a bit of alcohol.

【Cafe brewing】

菇飯跟白飯比起來，我們一致喜歡菇飯多一點！
濕度比較適中，帶有菇淡淡的香氣
<東坡肉>我們那天拿到肥瘦比很不均的一塊，吃到最後很油膩..> <
<土豆絲>偏糖醋、紅燒的做法，個人比較偏醋溜那派的，所以這道也比較吃不慣

🔸酒推薦：金吉百香

備註：
只收現金！","Meal time: 2022/11 Friday night
The decoration style is retro, and the small round table is very warm!
The sound of the scene is slightly louder, and speaking with friends at the same table will be a bit hard

The clerk is very nice. When you serve, you will talk about two sentences and feel like a friend!
On the same day, a friend at the same table was asked to be shot ~

The meal and the wine were slightly disappointed, not particularly amazing
(Because I was looking forward to this restaurant before!)
Recommended meals: Mapo Tofu
Compared with white rice, we like mushroom rice more!
The humidity is more moderate, with a faint aroma of mushrooms
<Dongpo Meat> We got a very uneven piece that day, and it was very greasy when I was eaten at the end ..> <
<Tudou shreds> Sweet and sour and braised practices, individuals are relatively vinegar, so this is more uncomfortable

"「台式古調、紅磚，信義區ㄉ一級戰區——延吉街的特色餐酒館🥢🥂」
歡迎光臨。
用心吃飯、用命喝酒。
疫情肆虐之下，我們有多久沒有好好和朋友們聚聚了呢？
我們有多久⋯沒有好好坐下來吃飯談天了呢？
一路從南部北漂到台北的我們，
又有多久⋯沒有好好見面⋯吐苦水了呢🥺⋯？
有時候太刻意地找個理由⋯想要慶生⋯
其實也只是想有個名目把大家都找出來見見面、喝喝酒、吵吵鬧鬧、一起重溫過去無憂的日子罷了！
那些Good old days都是因為有你們才完整🌈🌊
-
被恩熙俊燒到的台式餐酒館——弎樓，正是乘著這樣的思念、溫暖氛圍而立的吧！
將傳統台式甜點導入調酒🀄️，很特別。
而且⋯不雷⋯比原本預設立場得好喝很多🥺
（原本以為只是網美踩點店）
真心推薦！
尤其是烏梅番茄🍅（$380）
上面還有一顆番茄糖葫蘆，可愛！💓
味道有著蜜餞風味的鹹香⋯有酒感、但又不會太刺激味覺⋯
真心推(˶‾᷄ ⁻̫ ‾᷅˵)

友人點的蜂蜜普洱（$380）
上面的極甜濃密泡沫⋯很讚！
搭配酒感重的琴酒⋯味道融合⋯很搭！

另一杯楊桃釀（$350）也不錯～但前兩杯還是比較驚豔！

傳說中超厲害ㄉ酥炸 東坡肉（$380）
必須要剛好有吃到肥肉的部位～
瘦肉的部分稍微乾柴～
沒有想像中ㄉ猛 但還是不錯好吃😋

金沙絲瓜（$260）口感就如瘦子說的一樣十分smooth

塔香蛤蜊（$280）的蛤蜊有符合我心中的熟度！
不會熟到縮水的那種～不過可惜吐沙沒有吐得很乾淨🥲

菇飯（$30）菇味很輕～可以看情況點～

另外，清炒時蔬（水蓮）（$250）
被友人大力讚賞⋯直接點了兩盤🤣

其他品項⋯
弎樓小炒（$250）、三杯鴨胸（$250）麻婆豆腐（$250）、麻油松阪豬（$320）、干貝滷白菜（$300）
也都各點一份⋯很好吃⋯雖然沒有到真正熱炒店的那種香濃鍋氣感⋯
但已經算很厲害ㄌ⋯尤其是在餐酒館裡⋯🥺🥺

整體來說⋯調酒和台菜都很推⋯我們8位、一人酒➕菜約$7xx/人
在信義區一級戰區裡⋯算真的便宜又好吃ㄌ⋯而且⋯還被服務人員請了兩次shot🥺🥺🥺
好讚！服務人員感覺也是high咖🤣！
我們提早約一個月預定～有訂到包廂！

Eat with your heart and drink with life.
Under the raging epidemic, how long have we not gathered with our friends?

Good wine,

弎樓小炒個人覺得蠻優秀，有點像弎樓自己版本的客家小炒的調味。裡面有回鍋肉片、豬血糕等配料。

雞湯口味清淡鮮甜，很大鍋。雞肉蠻嫩、蛤蜊新鮮可以試試。

菇飯類似日式炊飯的味道，清淡但很美味。菇放了很多，份量也很夠，只要30元滿佛心的。

東坡肉個人覺得還不錯，但有點不像東坡肉😂瘦肉居多，但滿紮實的。醬汁的確是東坡肉的醬汁，但跟一般東坡肉肥肉居多的感覺有些微差距。

塔香蛤蜊份量很多，也滿新鮮。蠻推薦可以點看看。有附殼碗很貼心。

調酒個人喝了桂花弄跟體面。
桂花弄蛋白層較薄，酒感比較不濃厚的類型。蜂蜜是酸的口感，桂花香有出來。算是順口清爽的口味。

體面甜而清爽，很像吃花生冰沙的感覺。牛奶花生+麵茶的口味非常特殊，吸的時候喝得到花生粒。酒感有出來，是大人的甜品，相當推薦。

整體來說是值得推薦的台式餐酒館，有一成服務費但服務周到。可以事先訂位試試看！","The meal is excellent and the bartending is also good.

The Xiaolou Xiaoluan personally feels pretty excellent, a bit like the Step Lou's own version of Hakka fried seasoning.There are ingredients such as returning meat slices and pig blood cakes.

Chicken soup tastes light and sweet, very large pot.The chicken is quite tender and the clams can be tried.

Mushroom rice is similar to the taste of Japanese -style cooking, light but delicious.The mushrooms are put a lot, and the portion is enough, as long as 30 yuan full of Buddha heart.

Dongpo meat personally feels pretty good, but it is a bit like Dongpo meat is mostly lean meat, but it is full of solid.The sauce is indeed the sauce of Dongpo meat, but it feels slightly different from the general feeling of Dongpo meat.

The tower fragrant clams are full of weight and are full of freshness.I can click to see it.There is a shell bowl very intimate.

The bartender personally drank osmanthus and decent.
The osmanthus has a thin layer of protein and the wine is not strong.Honey is sour, and the fragrance of osmanthus is out.It is a refreshing taste.

The decent and refreshing feel is very like eating peanut smoothie.The taste of milk peanuts+noodle tea is very special. Drinking peanuts when sucking.The wine feel is a dessert for adults, which is quite recommended.

"弎樓是一家隱身在通化街中的一個三層老公寓改裝酒吧，走在騎樓其實不太顯眼容易錯過。
一進門就感受到懷舊感，一樓整體裝潢設計與傢俱（桌子椅子）的擺放，都讓人回到3、40年前的感覺。沿著樓梯走上二樓又是另外一片天地，除了在透明屋頂下的吧台外，廁所入口上方的「登樓有酒美夢歸」絕對是大家爭相打卡拍照的點。這次用餐也被安排在二樓，椅子下方都可以收納包包挺方便，但確實桌椅的高度不適合用餐。
可是這也是店家的設計，一樓為用餐區，二樓以上是酒吧，但也可以點菜，是想讓大家有個下酒菜配吧。
餐點的部分，這次點了東坡肉、蒼蠅頭、麻婆豆腐、炒水蓮、以及菇飯。配菜雖然都很下飯，但個人覺得口味還是偏鹹。菇飯倒是令人驚艷。
份量上來說，其實給的蠻夠，不會讓人覺得怎麼只有這樣一小點，以酒吧來說算有誠意。
酒單做得很有特色，是懷舊日曆的感覺，選項蠻多，若要喜歡的口味偏好，也可以跟bar tender指定。整體而言，服務生的態度也不錯，是一個舒適的用餐喝酒體驗。","The Tower is a three -storey apartment modified bar hidden in Tonghua Street. It is actually not conspicuous and easy to miss when walking on the tower.
As soon as you enter the door, you feel nostalgic. The overall decoration design and the placement of furniture (tables and chairs) on the first floor make people feel back 3 or 40 years ago.On the second floor along the stairs, there is another world. In addition to the bar under the transparent roof, the ""Linking of Jiu Beilou Dreams"" above the toilet entrance is definitely a point for everyone to check in.This time, the dining is also arranged on the second floor. It is convenient to store the bag under the chair, but the height of the table and chairs is not suitable for meals.
However, this is also the design of the store. The first floor is a dining area, and the second floor is a bar, but you can also order it. You want everyone to have a drink.
For the meal, this time I ordered Dongpo meat, flies, Mapo tofu, fried lotus lotus, and mushroom rice.Although the side dishes are very good, I personally feel that the taste is still salty.Mushroom rice is amazing.
In terms of portion, it is actually quite enough, and it will not make people feel that there is only such a small point, which is sincere as a bar.
The wine list is very distinctive. It is the feeling of nostalgic calendar. There are quite a lot of options. If you want to like the taste preference, you can also specify it with Bar Tender.On the whole, the attitude of the waiter is also good, it is a comfortable dining experience.",False

一到門口 整個找不到店家 再三確認地址 是沒有錯的啊
我覺得我跟朋友很呆 恕不知店名整個就在外牆上 還發亮著
但我們完全被門口的古早味吸引著 一直想拍照👉🏻👈🏻
一進門後 真的佈置得很舊式很復古 客人也多
我們座位是在二樓的吧檯區域 二樓就整個很漂亮很酒吧
而相對的一樓則比較偏向以前古時候的熱炒店～
它這邊還有第三層 但抬頭往上看 看不太清楚 但感覺網美風
整棟建築物三層樓都是各別不同風格 我覺得很特別🥺
再來餐點的部分 這邊菜單的菜色偏少樣化
可能這邊也比較主打酒品 晚上22:00後屬於酒吧
餐點變成宵夜場的菜單 而十點後就是讓人家喝酒放鬆
先說說我最喜歡的一道 應該就是頒給麻婆豆腐了
因為這應該是我吃過數一數二好吃的 很少麻婆豆腐色香味俱全
第二道讓我驚艷的是塔香蛤蠣 蛤蠣每一科都新鮮又大顆
我從來沒有在外面吃過這麼多汁飽滿大顆的蛤蠣～
每次媽媽買一樣大顆的都會邊碎嘴說很貴 外面很少有
結果今天竟然被我遇到了 很推薦大家點 比熱炒店好吃多了
再來是第三道是醉雞 滿香的 酒氣感覺也夠 肉也嫩
最後一道是皎白筍炒蛋 我個人覺得這道滿特別的
可是我覺得吃起來沒什麼特別的 沒有任何感想這樣
其實主要就只是把皎白筍跟但分開但放在同個盤子🤭
還有不得不說菇飯很香 先把菇爆炒在跟飯一起蒸真的讚
菇飯搭配上麻婆豆腐 兩三口之下整碗飯已經被我吃得差不多了
友人還說 拜託你不要在吃飯了 幫忙吃菜😂😂😂
最後飲品非常好喝 原本看了無酒精飲料沒什麼好喝
隨口一問是否有無酒精特調 竟然有 還有分口味
有百香果/葡萄/柳丁/莓果類等等的 多種特調 很建議大家點
非常推薦大家來這邊用餐 然後坐著聊天小酌！
還有這邊還有賣菸 很特別 很方便 有抽菸的朋友很推哦

It is not wrong to find the address again and again when I get to the door.
I think my friends and my friends are very dumb.
But we are completely attracted by the ancient taste at the door that I have always wanted to take pictures 👉🏻👈🏻
After entering the door, there are really many retro guests after entering the door
Our seat is on the second floor of the bar on the second floor.
The relative first floor is relatively biased towards the hot fried shop in ancient times ~
There is also the third layer on this side, but it is not clear to look up, but it feels like the beauty of the Internet
The three -story building of the whole building is different styles. I think it is very special.
The food of the menu here is less dish.
Maybe this is also compared to the wine after 22:00 in the evening
After the meal becomes the menu of the supper, after ten o'clock, let people drink and relax
Let me talk about my favorite one first is to give it to Mapo tofu
Because this should be one of the best, few delicious, few, few, Mako tofu color and fragrance are all all
The second thing that surprised me is that the tower fragrant oyster clam oysters are fresh and large every family
I have never eaten so much full of large and large oysters outside ~
Every time my mother buys the same big one, she will break her mouth and say it is very expensive.
As a result, I was encountered today. I recommend that everyone is much better than hot -fried shops.
The third is the third is the drunk chicken full of fragrant alcohol.
The last one is the white bamboo shoot scrambled egg. I personally think this is full
But I think there is nothing special to eat without any feelings like this
In fact, the main is just to separate the white bamboo shoots with but put it on the same plate 🤭
I have to say that the mushroom rice is very fragrant and stir -fry the mushrooms.
The whole bowl of rice with mushroom rice with Mako tofu has been eaten almost by me
Friends also said that you don’t want to eat, help to eat vegetables 😂😂😂
Finally, the drink is very delicious.
Ask casually if there is any alcoholic special tone, there is still a flavor
There are a variety of specials of passion fruit/grapes/liquids/berries, etc.

"隱藏在台北安靜街區的美妙地下酒吧。氣氛絕對是5分。入口有點難找，因為門上沒有標籤。有一位女士站在前面引導我們進去。

But it doesn't seem to be clean?Because when we sat down, a mouse ran around the dining area!What a terrible!

The customers other than us jumped up and did not dare to sit in her seat again.

"沒有拍太多照片，但是飲料和食物都很棒！
他們的晚餐時間是晚上10點之前，晚餐時間是晚上10點30分之後。我們吃得太飽了，所以我們只點了晚餐，是炒蛤蜊。份量非常適合兩人吃，蛤蜊也很新鮮。
下次一定會嘗試在那裡吃晚餐！","There are not too many photos, but drinks and food are great!
Their dinner time was before 10 pm, and the dinner time was after 10:30 pm.We ate too much, so we only ordered dinner, frying clams.The weight is very suitable for two people, and the clams are also very fresh.
I will try to have dinner there next time!",False
這個地方非常隱密。入口看起來就像是典型台灣家庭的門。當我沿著地圖行走時，我完全走過了它。建築物顧名思義，共有 3 層。首先是餐廳，二樓是我最喜歡的酒吧和涼爽的懸掛樹枝，三樓是一個更像休息室的環境。我去參加朋友的生日，所以我們點了一堆食物來分享。我最喜歡的是他們的五花肉脂肪。我還點了一杯覆盆子、荔枝和可爾必思雞尾酒，非常好喝，我的朋友點了一杯接骨木花和黃瓜雞尾酒，非常清爽。價格都在350-400左右。我最終和另外 4 個人分攤了 400 美元，我的飲料花了 350 美元。總的來說，服務很好，氛圍很酷。請注意，他們最多有 2 小時的座位限制。,"This place is very secretive.The entrance looks like the door of a typical Taiwanese family.When I walked along the map, I walked completely.The building is as the name implies, with a total of 3 floors.The first is the restaurant. The second floor is my favorite bar and cool hanging branches. The third floor is a more environment like lounge.I went to participate in my friend's birthday, so we ordered a bunch of food to share.My favorite is their pork belly fat.I also ordered a cup of raspberry, lychee, and cocked to think of cocktails. It was very delicious. My friend ordered a cup of bone wood flowers and cucumber cocktails, which was very refreshing.The price is around 350-400.I eventually shared $ 400 with the other four, and my drink spent $ 350.In general, the service is very good and the atmosphere is cool.Please note that they have a maximum of 2 hours of seat restrictions.",False
令人驚嘆的氛圍和氛圍以及真正獨特的雞尾酒。室內設計真的很漂亮。他們也有最好的服務。有一位非常漂亮的女服務員，我一直在關注她，她非常甜美和熱情。有史以來最好的酒吧體驗！,"The amazing atmosphere and atmosphere, as well as a truly unique cocktail.The interior design is really beautiful.They also have the best service.There is a very beautiful female waiter who has been paying attention to her, she is very sweet and enthusiastic.The best bar experience in history!",False
古色古香的裝潢，環境舒適，但二樓有點吵。雞尾酒很棒，但食物很貴。女服務生很友善。必須提前預約。,"The antique decoration is comfortable with the environment, but the second floor is a bit noisy.Cocktails are great, but food is expensive.Women's waiters are very friendly.You must make an appointment in advance.",False
適合一個人或一群朋友的好地方。不錯的雞尾酒。很老式的台灣風格的裝飾，但是酒吧裡的桌子有限，最好去之前預約或早點到。,"Suitable for a good place for a person or a group of friends.Good cocktail.Very old -fashioned Taiwan -style decoration, but the table in the bar is limited, it is best to make an appointment or earlier.",False
這是一個充滿復古氣息的地方，類似首爾的乙支路。我記得雞尾酒是因為它們獨特而美麗。餐單沒有英文說明，但睡蓮莖、麻婆豆腐、蘑菇飯都很好吃，雖然我剛吃過晚餐！而且雖然英文不好，但是店員都很友善。似乎有很多年輕的台灣潮人:) 一顆隱藏的寶石！,"This is a place full of retro atmosphere, similar to Seoul's Bide Road.I remember cocktails because of their unique and beautiful.There is no English description in the menu, but the water lily stems, Mapo tofu, and mushroom rice are delicious, although I have just had dinner!And although English is not good, the clerk is very friendly.There seems to be many young Taiwanese tide people :) a hidden gem!",False
我在這裡度過了最美妙的晚餐體驗！餐廳精美的氛圍和令人驚嘆的內部營造出完美的氛圍。從精緻的裝飾到無可挑剔的服務，每個細節都非常出色。食物呢？簡直就是神！這是一次我不會忘記的美食之旅。 🍽,"I have the most wonderful dinner experience here!The exquisite atmosphere of the restaurant and the amazing interior create a perfect atmosphere.From exquisite decoration to impeccable services, every detail is very good.What about food?It's God!This is a gourmet trip that I will not forget.Bleak",False

"我了解了餐廳的概念，當我走進這個空間時，我很期待用餐體驗。
我坐的桌子很不舒服，因為它太低了，它更像是一張躺椅而不是餐椅，而且桌子也很低。工作人員訓練有素，因此沒有什麼可責怪他們的，因為他們只是按照要求行事。我認為他們的餐具選擇有一些需要改進的地方…我要了一個湯匙來吃米飯，然後他們給了我一個很大的湯匙🤣，而且事實上，從入座的那一刻起，這頓飯必須在 90 分鐘內完成，這有點倉促和不愉快。
食物方面，大多數菜餚都很好，但有一道菜我們都不想吞下，這是一個巨大的失望。這又是主觀的，所以我不想具體說明那是哪一道菜。不過上菜速度還蠻及時的。
我認為不舒服的座位是最讓我身體困擾的，然後是比平常的勺子大2-3倍的不方便的餐具，沒有熱飲，還有這道奇怪的菜，不太能忍受，再加上90 分鐘的限制，這在週末晚上可不是一件值得打擾的事情。我不認為我會回來，但我確實很欣賞奶奶的風格等概念。","I understand the concept of the restaurant. When I walk into this space, I am looking forward to the dining experience.
The table I was sitting was very uncomfortable because it was too low, it was more like a lounge chair instead of a dining chair, and the table was very low.The staff is well -trained, so there is nothing to blame them because they just act as required.I think their tableware choices have some places that need to be improved ... I asked for a spoon to eat rice, and then they gave me a large spoon. In fact, from the moment of the seat, this meal must be at the moment of the seat. It was completed in 90 minutes, which is a bit hasty and unpleasant.
In terms of food, most dishes are very good, but we don't want to swallow a dish. This is a huge disappointment.This is subjective, so I don't want to specify which dish it is.But the speed of serving is quite timely.
I think the uncomfortable seat is the most disturbing me, and then the inconvenient tableware 2-3 times larger than the usual spoon, there is no hot drink, and this strange dish. The 90 -minute restrictions are not worthy of disturbing on weekends.I don't think I will come back, but I really appreciate the concepts of grandma's style.",False
美味的食物，非常當地的，很棒的桶裝啤酒和雞尾酒。喜歡我們在這裡的晚餐。語言困難 - 找一個會說中文的人或可以打電話的人！手寫中文選單,"Delicious food, very local, great barrel beer and cocktail.Like our dinner here.Difficulty of Language -Find someone who speaks Chinese or people who can call!Handwriting Chinese menu",False
"雖然調味料很流行，但米飯確實很好吃。麻婆豆腐尤其出色。無論你點什麼，都很美味，而且大部分餐點都適合搭配白飯。然而，酒精價格昂貴、稀缺且平庸。食物不貴，為什麼酒這麼貴？
店內氛圍時尚，充滿復古氣息。我理解復古的感覺，但是餐具很便宜。","Although seasonings are very popular, rice is really delicious.Mapo Tofu is particularly excellent.No matter what you order, it is delicious, and most of the meals are suitable for white rice.However, alcohol is expensive, scarce and mediocre.The food is not expensive, why is wine so expensive?

牆上有一個非常漂亮的洞。從外觀上看並不顯眼，一旦您進入酒店，就會獲得最美妙的體驗。飲料值得一試，深夜的飲品非常美味！,"There is a very beautiful hole on the wall.It is not conspicuous from the appearance. Once you enter the hotel, you will get the most wonderful experience.Drinks are worth trying, and the drink late at night is very delicious!",False
當地酷孩子和名人的聚會場所。不確定服務和氛圍發生了什麼變化，可能是新的人員配備？很酷的地方，而且食物仍然很棒。不過不會再回來了。,"Local cool children and celebrities gathering venues.What changes have taken place in the uncertain service and atmosphere, maybe it is equipped with new personnel?It is cool, and the food is still great.But I won't come back again.",False

復古的裝飾和整體服務都很好。然而，有2小時的時間限制，這對酒吧來說是荒謬的。我可以理解對餐廳的限制，但對於酒吧來說，這只是糟糕的商業行為。你允許人們停留的時間越長，他們點的飲料就越多，就這麼簡單。,"The retro decoration and overall service are very good.However, 2 hours of time limit is ridiculous for bars.I can understand the restrictions on the restaurant, but for the bar, this is just a bad business behavior.The longer you allow people to stay, the more drinks they ordered, which is as simple as.",False
氣氛很好，食物和雞尾酒都不錯。,"The atmosphere is good, and the food and cocktails are good.",False
說實話，炸雞翅有點無味。我們點的雞尾酒很普通。不過Keera的服務很棒所以我覺得還是值得你去一次的。,"To be honest, fried chicken wings are a bit tasteless.The cocktail we ordered was very ordinary.But Keera's service is great, so I think it's worth your time.",False
