"整體是很雷的用餐體驗。

一入座店員說用餐限時兩小時就走了，沒有給菜單跟水，等一陣子很多服務生路過也沒有人進一步服務，叫很久才跟服務生要到菜單。

服務生拿一張主餐的紙放桌上又立馬離開，問另外一位說可以介紹嗎，他對著菜單一次講了五樣菜品名說推薦，什麼料理內容都沒介紹，就停下定格站著不動，大概隔五秒我超尷尬得問說介紹完了嗎⋯，服務生說對。我說嗯⋯好⋯我們看一下，他再度離開。

後來我們拿網路餐點照片問有這道嗎，服務生說有喔，進一步詢問在菜單的哪裡後，服務生才去拿另張菜單紙說在那上面，完全不懂為什麼不能一次提供，問了也不主動給。

後續上餐除了餐點上菜講錯菜品外（牛肉講羊肉），也無介紹，用餐完更無詢問餐點服務改進意見，整體食物普通，麵醬稀無法扒在食物上，肉質很澀，法式吐司口感軟爛到誇張，用餐環境嘈雜，桌距近到服務生上餐困難，在均消一客超過1500的價位裡，很難以想像有這麼糟糕的用餐體驗。","The overall is a very thunderous dining experience.

As soon as I entered the shopkeeper, the meal was left for a limited time. It did not give the menu and water. When many waiters passed by for a while, no one was further served.

The waiter took a piece of the main meal and put it on the table and immediately left. Ask another one who said that he can introduce it. He told the menu to recommend the name of the five dishes at a time. If the content of the dishes is not introduced, stop the freeze. Standing without moving, about five seconds I was so embarrassed that I was so embarrassed that the introduction was over, the waiter said right.I said um, okay, let's take a look, he left again.

Later, we took a photo of the online meal and asked if there was this. The waiter said yes. After asking where the menu was, the waiter went to use another menu paper to say there. I didn't take the initiative to ask.

After the meal, the meal is except for the dishes and the dishes (beef speaking mutton), and there is no introduction. After the meal, there is no asking for the improvement of the meal service improvement.

人均TWD1880不含酒，好喜歡沙拉裡羽衣甘藍的厚質地，苦味沒那麼明顯，搭配酸醬汁好好吃，跟之前吃過kale 的不一樣。包廂環境很不錯，外場位子相近，客滿的話蠻吵的。主菜份量不少，八個人刷菜單竟然有吃飽，因我喝了三杯酒加水。這家餐點有正餐感，不是佐酒食等級，且冠軍特調八杯調酒有特色，酒感也有。這家店真心推，至少空間感跟地緣關係都比較有質感。一進門右手邊長型吧台品飲區，戶外似乎也有三桌立食區，不確定是否為餐廳所有～,"The per capita TWD1880 does not contain alcohol.

"這是一家具有用餐氣氛、可以兩人約會/多人聚餐都值得考慮的餐酒館。
調酒價位帶在信義區算是相當親民，也不因其價格而有份量較少的感覺，推薦可以從琴酒基底的開始喝起，第二杯開始就會有微醺的感覺。
餐點部分今天點了四道菜：
1. 青筍：爽口不油膩，是一個適合下酒的蔬菜料理，盤底還有鋪上一起司，先吃一口上面蔬菜的原味，接著再全部攪拌，又是一道層次相當豐富的蔬食料理。推薦。
2. 烤蝦：口味與一般烤蝦料理並無太大差異、也沒有特殊調味，但蝦本身夠大、夠新鮮，在口中咀嚼可以感受到他的脆口以及濃厚的蝦味。喜歡吃蝦、想補充優質蛋白質的，推薦這道料理。
3. 炸全雞：最後餐點的重頭戲，服務生會先把全雞搬到面前讓你打卡拍照，接著就會把全雞送進廚房分切小塊。雞腿、雞翅部分我認為是多汁、鮮嫩的。其他部分，並不會覺得柴，我猜是因為雞本身有先舒肥過，故全雞的口感都維持在彈牙的階段。
除雞肉本身，這道菜還會附上炸薯條，它非常涮嘴、下酒，搭配上紅辣醬與黃蜂蜜芥末醬，根本就可以當另外一道菜。
最後，還有一小鍋雞油為底，燉煮而成的濃醬搭配蔬菜與蘑菇，這個醬，則又賦予了這一道菜另外一個風貌，建議搭配雞胸一起享用。
4. 甜點西多士：份量不多，一個人可以吃完，西多士本身很香醇、軟嫩，可配合鮮奶油、橙酒冰淇淋、太妃糖漿一起吃，都相當合適。特別推薦深咖啡色的太妃糖漿！與西多士一起吃，能帶給你一種底蘊濃厚的香醇口感。

服務部分，我們用餐大約兩小時多，服務人員相當客氣、有禮貌，展現出了這是家設立在星級酒店中該有的服務態度，包含：引導客人到座位後幫忙拉椅子、結完帳準備離開餐廳時幫忙開門送客，這些都讓人印象深刻。餐點美味與否不一定是重點，那種滿滿的人文情懷，有時才是大家選擇餐廳時勝出的關鍵。

最後要提一下廁所，地板乾爽、空氣無異味，馬桶選用TOTO免治馬桶，有提供護墊以及刷樂漱口水，這樣的安排，整理來說高於平均水準。

總結，這是一家我還會帶更多人來分享的餐廳
希望這次的體驗依然能夠維持，未來也期望可以吃到更多不同、令人滿意的菜色。","This is a dining tavern with a dining atmosphere, a dating/multi -person dinner.
The bartending price is quite close to the people, nor does it feel that the amount of weight is less due to its price. It is recommended to start with the foundation of the piano wine, and the second cup will feel slightly.
The meal section ordered four dishes today:
1. Green bamboo shoots: refreshing and not greasy. It is a vegetable dish suitable for wine. There are also paved with the bottom of the plate. First, eat the original flavor of the vegetables on it, and then stir all. Essencerecommend.
2. Roasted shrimp: The taste is not much different from the general grilled shrimp dishes, and there is no special seasoning, but the shrimp itself is large and fresh enough. To chew in your mouth, you can feel his crispy mouth and thick shrimp flavor.If you like to eat shrimp and want to add high -quality protein, this dish is recommended.
3. Fried whole chicken: At the end of the meal, the waiter will first move the whole chicken to the front of the chicken for you to check in and take pictures, and then send the whole chicken into the kitchen to cut a small piece.I think chicken legs and chicken wings are juicy and tender.In other parts, I do n’t think Chai. I guess it ’s because the chicken itself was so comfortable, so the taste of the whole chicken was maintained at the stage of elastic teeth.
In addition to the chicken itself, this dish will also attach fried fries. It is very pouting and wine. It can be used as another dish with red hot sauce and gymnopus mustard sauce.
Finally, there is a small pot of chicken oil at the bottom. The thick sauce made of stewed with vegetables and mushrooms. This sauce gives this dish another look. It is recommended to enjoy it with chicken breasts.
4. Dessert Sidos: There is not much portion, a person can finish eating, Sidos itself is very mellow and soft. It can be eaten with fresh cream, orange wine ice cream, and concubine syrup, which is quite suitable.Special recommendation of deep coffee tadpie syrup!Eating with Sidos can bring you a strong flavor of mellow.

For the service section, we have more than two hours of dining. The service staff is quite polite and polite. It shows that this is a service attitude that should be established in a star hotel, including: guiding guests to help pull chairs and finish the account after the seats are guided to the seat, finish the account, and complete the account. It is impressive to help open the door when leaving the restaurant to help open the door.The delicious meal is not necessarily the focus. The full humanistic feelings are sometimes the key to winning when everyone choose the restaurant.

Finally, I have to mention the toilet. The floor is dry and the air is not odor. The toilet is used to use TOTO to prevent the toilet. It provides a pad and a brushing and rushing saliva. This arrangement is higher than the average level.

"在寒舍艾美一樓，裝潢擺設很有質感，餐點大致上都蠻好吃的，以飯店內餐廳而言價格算是合理。

服務人員親切周到。

***比較喜歡的料理：
炭烤青甘魚下巴,參巴醬,四季豆（580元）外皮烤得很剛好的微焦脆，肉嫩，一點酸辣的參巴醬搭得很好吃

羊肉漢堡排,炸鷹嘴豆餅,咖哩（680元）羊肉、咖哩都是味重，沒想到再配上味道也獨特的鷹嘴豆，結果很搭

羽衣甘藍,草莓,無花果,薰衣草油醋（320元）調味好吃

青花筍,煙燻布拉塔,綠番茄莎莎醬,杜卡（320元）青花菜混合蘆筍，配布拉塔起司

***以下是覺得可以更好
墨魚汁燉飯,軟絲,西班牙臘腸,螢烏賊（580元）軟絲份量不多，而且好像太多油

炸全雞,鴨油薯條,鄉村肉汁（1080元）皮酥酥的，雞肉也好吃；但外面烤雞炸雞店也能吃到很接近的口味，所以不驚喜，而且相對價高

烤蝦,柚子胡椒優格,涼拌菜絲（580元）蝦子ok，但也是沒有太驚喜。配的涼拌菜普普

炸比薩、瑪格麗特醬（280元）炸比薩香香鹹鹹，很像蔥油餅的口感。","On the first floor of Emi, the decoration is very textured, and the meals are roughly delicious. In terms of restaurants in the restaurant, the price is reasonable.

The service staff is kind and thoughtful.

*** Favorite cuisine:
Charcoal roasted green fish chin, ginseng sauce, four seasons (580 yuan) outer skin grilled very slightly crispy, tender meat, a little hot and sour ginseng sauce is delicious

Lamb Burger, fried eagle mouth bean cake, curry (680 yuan) mutton and curry are all heavy. I did not expect to match the unique eagle mouth beans, but the result is very good.

Yuyi Cabbage, Strawberry, Figs, Lavender Oil Vinegar (320 yuan) Seasoning and delicious

Blue and white bamboo shoots, smoky Pulata, green tomato Sasha sauce, Dcoka (320 yuan) green vegetables mixed with asparagus, with cloth cheese

*** The following feels that it can be better
Ink fish juice stewed rice, soft shredded, Spanish sausage, fluorescent squid (580 yuan) soft silk, and it seems to be too much oil

Fried chicken, duck oil and potato strip, rural gravy (1080 yuan) crispy skin, chicken is also delicious;

Roasted shrimp, grapefruit pepper yogurt, cold vegetable shreds (580 yuan) shrimp is OK, but it is not too surprised.Pattipure cold dish Pupu

Fried Pisa, Margaret Sauce (280 yuan) fried bikhi is fragrant and salty, and it looks like the taste of green onion oil cakes.",False,0.129,0.0,0.871,0.9851

"Tap 酒吧位於 Le Median 酒店內。
請注意，這是一家附屬於餐廳的酒吧，因此酒吧食物菜單和餐廳食物菜單不同，並且您不能在酒吧點餐廳菜單項目。
菜單上共有8種現調雞尾酒，讓您可以享受原創雞尾酒！
我是星期日去的，餐廳已經訂滿了，所以一般不允許預約。另一方面，如果有吧台，步行者也可以使用室內區域。
商店本身位於 Lemedian 經營範圍內，但 Bonboy 不適用。","The TAP bar is located in the Le Median Hotel.
Please note that this is a bar attached to the restaurant, so the bar food menu is different from the restaurant food menu, and you cannot order the restaurant menu project in the bar.
There are 8 types of cocktails on the menu, allowing you to enjoy the original cocktail!

"這家餐廳還沒有正式開業，但一切似乎都已經準備就緒。派對的氛圍非常好，有多種飲料可供選擇，大部分是前面酒吧的標籤，提供雞尾酒、葡萄酒和生啤酒。

食物棒極了，半隻鴨子出奇的好吃，烤西蘭花非常好吃，下面還有白起司。

看得出來廚師在菜單上下了很大的功夫和創意。

工作人員受過專業培訓，他們對所有菜餚瞭如指掌，並向我們解釋得很好。

期待開業後再回來。","This restaurant has not yet officially opened, but everything seems to be ready.The atmosphere of the party is very good. There are many beverages to choose from. Most of them are labels in the previous bar, which offers cocktails, wine and raw beer.

The food is great, half a duck is surprisingly delicious, the roasted broccoli flower is very delicious, and there is a white cheese below.

It can be seen that the chef has a lot of kung fu and creativity on the menu.

The staff was well -trained, and they pointed at all the dishes and explained to us very well.
