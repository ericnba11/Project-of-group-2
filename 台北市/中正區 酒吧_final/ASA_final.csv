地點相對比較偏遠的日本卡拉OK，不過櫃台老闆人很客氣，也不會斤斤計較。地點是整棟老公寓改裝，比較不怕打擾到其他住戶，廁所也很乾淨，是唱起來很舒服的一間店。,"The relatively remote Japanese Kara OK, but the owner of the counter is very polite and will not care about it.The location is the modification of the entire apartment, which is not afraid of disturbing other residents, and the toilet is very clean.

"台灣少數的日式卡拉 OK 餐廳之一
西門、中山也有，但太有名了。
我經常使用這個地方，因為它總是客滿。

房間很乾淨，價格也便宜。
強烈推薦

不過，位置非常難找。
酒吧旁邊有一個空間，有一個狹窄的樓梯。
爬上去就可以到達
沒有招牌，所以我在周圍閒逛了好一會兒。
我認為在 Facebook 上發布說明是個好主意！","One of the few Japanese -style karaoke restaurants in Taiwan
There are also Ximen and Zhongshan, but they are too famous.
I often use this place because it is always full.

The room is clean and the price is cheap.
Strong recommendation

However, the location is very difficult to find.
There is a space next to the bar with a narrow staircase.
You can get up to get up
There is no signboard, so I wandered around for a while.
I think it is a good idea to publish a description on Facebook!",False,0.114,0.061,0.825,0.7686

服務人員態度很差，工作人員的態度真的很差，不推薦這裡，而且空調也不冷，感覺就像在桑拿房裡唱歌一樣,"The attitude of the service staff is very poor, the staff’s attitude is really poor, it is not recommended, and the air conditioner is not cold. It feels like singing in the sauna house.",False,0.061,0.205,0.734,-0.7076
