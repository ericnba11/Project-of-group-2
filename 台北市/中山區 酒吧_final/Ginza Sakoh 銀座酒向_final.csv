"每年回台灣都會來喝Negroni的地方，因為我一直認為（再也不認為）這是全台北經典調酒最好喝的店。很可惜，來訪第四/五次，我的評價是「退步太多、太看客人國籍、且不願聆聽&檢討」。長年居住歐洲，每天喝調酒，就算我的工作是品嚐橄欖油和葡萄酒，但調酒好壞，也是大概知道。到店短短20分鐘，我點了兩杯Negroni，以前都是因為喜歡、喝完了所以再點一樣的第二杯，這一次、卻是因為第一杯沒有冰杯也沒對杯緣下細節功夫，我喝到杯子沒洗乾淨的味道（非常噁心），缺乏了Citron且每一口都是溫熱的（媽啊）！眾所皆知Negroni講究的是比例、香氣和溫度，女生調酒師的比例沒有錯，但所有其他細節都沒做，只在杯子裏面放了一個大冰塊...這樣跟其他大部分台北酒吧沒有做到差別化，沒有不好喝，只是再也、再也、再也、不是我最好喝第一名經典調酒的酒吧！我不是生氣，我是心痛。第一名沒了，我又必須踏上尋找之路。

最讓人髮指的是，服務的所有人（一位台灣可愛小女生但聽不懂客人的細節要求、一位莫名其妙的日本女調酒師我希望她堅強的外表只是偽裝、一位不知國籍的台灣男調酒師表現專業但不服務我這區、和我每次都見到的日本男老闆）
...都不想聽反應。我輕輕柔柔地呼喚、告知，第一位新人或許因為老闆規定不要浪費時間跟客人講話，所以都在裝忙，第二位用日文假裝聽不懂。拜託！或許有時候有人會裝懂、或喝醉重複、或對著他們咆哮，但我很小聲並有禮貌地表達意見、我告訴她，我真心希望下次回來他們能夠再進步。可....惜....女調酒師明明訂位接電話會講中文，遇到我告訴她沒有冰杯時，聽我一句話、就直接用日文回覆「我聽不懂」，好，這是她解決客人反應的方式，但為何一直到坐我隔壁的客人（說中文）詢問好不好吃、好不好喝，還交談？！這麼討厭我還是妳就是不願意承認妳做給我喝的就是隨便做？？

在你跟隔壁交談前、也就是在我在坐下的第20分鐘，我點了一樣的Negroni第二杯。為了確認不要再喝到噁心的杯子味道，我告知路過的第三位吧台男生，請他幫我注意。結果、好多了，但怎麼冰塊就不見了....我心裡想：「請問你們瘋了嗎？？」我前一杯請你們拿掉冰塊是因為冰塊在杯中融化太快，但不代表我一開始就不要冰塊！

離開前（結帳四千後）我告知第四位日本人，如果每天調酒都一樣、不注意夏天溫度和溶冰狀況，我只會冬天來，因為他們只有冬天才會做出完美的經典調酒。聽懂無不重要，能在台北生存這麼久，他一定有他們的原則和想法，店裡面什麼規定都可以，但調酒的品質不能退步啊！真心希望他們下次進步。我還會再來喝一次，再不行就只好再也不來（香腸好吃但服務人員不知道哪裡做的，讓客人「無知」可能也是一種服務方式，反正他們大概認為大家都是隨口問沒人認真吧）","Every year, I will come to Taiwan to drink Negroni, because I have always thought (I don't think again) this is the best shop in Taipei classic bartender.It is a pity that I visited the fourth/fifth time. My evaluation was ""too much back, too much for guests, and unwilling to listen & review.""I have lived in Europe for many years and drinking alcohol every day. Even if my job is to taste olive oil and wine, but the bartending is good or bad, it is probably known.In just 20 minutes at the store, I ordered two cups of Negroni. I used to like the second cup because I liked and finished drinking. Details, I drank the taste of not washing the cup (very disgusting), lacking citron and each bite was warm (mom)!Everyone knows that Negroni pays attention to the proportion, aroma, and temperature. The proportion of girls' bartender is not wrong, but all other details are not done. Only a large ice cubes are placed in the cup ... This is like most other Taipei in Taipei. The bar is not differentiated, and there is no bad taste, but it is again again, again, again, again, and not my best to drink the first classic bartending bar!I am not angry, I feel heartache.The first place is gone, and I have to embark on the way to find.

The most important thing is that the service owner (a cute little girl in Taiwan but not understanding the details of the guests, an inexplicable Japanese female alcoholicist, I hope her strong appearance is just a disguise, an unknown nationality, an unknown nationality Taiwanese male alcoholics perform professional but do not serve me in this area, and Japanese male boss every time I see))
... I don't want to hear the reaction.I called and informed it softly. The first newcomer may be because the boss does not waste time to talk to the guests, so I am busy, and the second place can not understand in Japanese pretend.Please!Maybe sometimes people pretend to understand, or they are drunk, or they growls, but I whispered and politely expressed their opinions, and I told her that I really hope that they can progress again next time.But ... Xi .... Female winemakers clearly reservation and answer the phone will speak Chinese. When I encounter me telling her that there is no ice cup, listening to me in a word, I will directly reply to ""I don’t understand"" in Japanese, Okay, this is the way she solves the guest response, but why did the guests next door (speaking Chinese) asking me to ask if it is delicious, good or delicious, and talk about it?IntersectionI hate me so much or you just do n’t want to admit that you do what you do is just doing it?Intersection

Before you talked with the next door, the 20th minute I was sitting, I ordered the same Negroni second cup.In order to confirm that you do n’t drink the disgusting cup, I informed the third bar boy passing by and asked him to help me pay attention.As a result, it was much better, but how the ice cubes disappeared ... I thought to myself, ""Are you crazy?"" I asked you to remove the ice in the previous cup because the ice cubes melted too fast in the cup, but It doesn't mean that I don't want ice from the beginning!

Before leaving (after the checkout four thousand), I informed the fourth Japanese that if the bartender is the same every day, not paying attention to the temperature and dissolving ice in the summer, I will only come in winter, because they will only make a perfect classic in winter. Bartender.It is not important to understand. He can survive in Taipei for so long. He must have their principles and ideas. It can be used in the store, but the quality of bartending cannot be retreated!I sincerely hope that they will make progress next.I will drink it again, and I will never come again.

因優雅的裝飾而被朋友推薦，但對服務和座位費非常失望？這是聞所未聞的！雞尾酒的價格已經比台北的頂級酒吧還貴了，當我們選擇從酒吧搬到普通餐桌時，我們甚至沒有被告知每人需要 300 台幣的餐桌費。這筆費用是一個笑話，聞所未聞，服務員甚至沒有禮貌地告訴我們，只有在我們收到賬單時才知道！再也不會回來了！,"Recommended by friends because of elegant decoration, but is disappointing service and seat fees?This is unheard of!The price of cocktails is already more expensive than the top bars in Taipei. When we choose to move from the bar to an ordinary dining table, we have not even told each person to need a table fee of 300 Taiwan dollars.This cost is a joke.

我最近訪問了這家酒吧並遇到了意想不到的收費。座位費一樓每人新台幣300元，樓上每人新台幣500元，另加強制10%服務費。直到我收到帳單後，工作人員才將這些訊息傳達給我，這讓我感到驚訝。我認為提前告知客戶此類費用非常重要。因此，加上這些額外費用，一杯雞尾酒的成本可達新台幣約1000元。我點了一杯以龍舌蘭酒為基礎的雞尾酒，很失望地發現調酒師用的是 Jose Cuervo，坦白說，這是一種便宜、品質差的龍舌蘭酒。鑑於一瓶Jose Cuervo的零售價只有700新台幣，我預計1000新台幣的雞尾酒會配備Patron或Don Julio等更高品質的龍舌蘭酒。,"I recently visited this bar and encountered unexpected charges.The seat fee on the first floor is NT $ 300 per person, and the upstairs is NT $ 500 per person.It wasn't until I received the bill that the staff conveyed these messages to me, which surprised me.I think it is important to inform customers in advance.Therefore, with these additional costs, the cost of a cup of cocktails can reach NT $ 1,000.I ordered a curved cocktail based on agave wine. I was disappointed that the bartender used Jose Cuervo. Frankly, this is a cheap, poorly -quality liquid wine.Given that a bottle of Jose Cuervo's retail price is only NT $ 700, I expect that the cocktail of NT $ 1,000 will be equipped with higher -quality agave wines such as Patron or Don Julio.",0.035,0.022,0.943,-0.0772

這是一個美麗的酒吧，但不幸的是，我們與經理的經歷留下了酸澀的味道。這家酒吧很不尋常，座位費每人新台幣300。這對我們來說是第一次——我們已經習慣了最低消費，但完全單獨收費是很不尋常的。但是，至少您會提前得到通知並可以決定是否要留下來。我們決定留下來喝一杯。在某個時候，經理走到我的朋友面前，要求她不要把腳放在椅子上。事實是，她的腳並沒有放在椅子上，而是交叉著雙腿，靴子的後跟抵在椅子上——但肯定不是「踩」在椅子上。我們打電話給經理，因為他說這是居高臨下的方式，幾乎就像責備一個小孩一樣。我們解釋了情況，表示我們對我朋友的談話方式不滿意，並對他的態度感到生氣。然後他問我們想要什麼。道歉是顯而易見的——他確實提出了這一點，但缺乏誠意。長話短說，與經理的經歷讓我們感到失望，破壞了我們在這家酒吧的體驗。他極其傲慢和驕傲。他不知道什麼是客戶服務，需要學習如何尊重客戶。不用說，我們絕對不推薦這個酒吧，也不會再來。不值得支付座位費。,"This is a beautiful bar, but unfortunately, our experience with the manager leaves a sour taste.This bar is unusual, and the seat fee is NT $ 300 per person.This is the first time for us -we have become accustomed to the minimum consumption, but it is unusual to charge it alone.However, at least you will be notified in advance and you can decide whether to stay.We decided to stay for a drink.At some point, the manager walked in front of my friend and asked her not to put her feet on a chair.The fact is that her feet were not placed on a chair, but her legs were crossed, and the boots were on the chair -but it was definitely not ""stepped"" on the chair.We called the manager because he said that this was a high way of standing, almost like blaming a child.We explained the situation, saying that we were not satisfied with my friend's conversation and angry with his attitude.Then he asked us what we wanted.The apology is obvious -he did propose this, but lacks sincerity.To say a long time, the experience with the manager disappointed us and destroyed our experience in this bar.He is extremely arrogant and proud.He doesn't know what customer service is, and he needs to learn how to respect customers.Needless to say, we never recommend this bar, and we won't come again.Not worth paying for seat fees.",0.069,0.12,0.811,-0.9405
