新菜單真的深得我心 價錢合理 味道特別 聽說後續還有新菜色會新增 這次是荷蘭鬆餅有甜有鹹真的喜歡 還會再來,"The new menu really won the reasonable price of my heart. Specialty. I heard that there are new dishes. This time, it will be added. This time, it is sweet and salty in the Netherlands."
"我們辦活動所以在這裡包場
事先點了餐點 但有幾桌先到
請他們先上炸薯條 他們說不行要炸的話
要全部一起上 我覺得超怪的
啊如果有單點的客人不是也一份一份上的嗎

飲料的部分：啤酒滿推的 其他飲料有點慘不忍睹

餐點：沙拉推推 但牛排超不推 擺盤很美
但是真的太像在吃橡皮筋了🥲 第一次上來太生有貼心的幫我們二次加熱 但還是一樣啦
感覺不太值得

甜點：三種甜點我們都有點 都滿不錯的 特別是提拉米蘇跟熔岩巧克力布丁口感見仁見智","Our activities, so we will package the field here
I ordered a meal in advance but there were a few tables first
Please go to the fries first, do they say what they want to fry
I think it's super weird to go together
Ah, isn't there a single -point guest?

Part of the drink: The other drinks full of beer are a bit terrible

Meal: Salad push but the steak is super beautiful.
But it's really too much like eating rubber bands. For the first time, I came up and helped us to heat it twice, but it's still the same.
It's not worth it

Dessert: We are a bit good for three kinds of desserts, especially Tiramisu and lava chocolate pudding mouth."
空間環境挑高，還有大螢幕，若是看球賽很舒服。餐點牛舌寬麵必點，鮮釀啤酒口味多樣，搭配餐點啊之後輕爽,"The space environment is high, and there are big screens. It is very comfortable to watch the game.Meal the beef tongue wide noodles must be ordered, fresh beer has a variety of flavors."
"二訪樹懶基地🦥
依舊坐在有夜店風格的二樓

🥬 烤蔬菜：無功無過 茄子沒什麼味道
🦀 蟹黃燉飯：每一粒米都有裹上蟹黃，還有整隻肉很多的軟殼蟹點綴 驚艷
🐄 牛舌寬扁麵：炸牛蒡在一旁增加口感，麵條雖粗但很入味，牛舌軟嫩

桌和桌之間實在太近
隔壁桌講話會干擾 希望可以改善","Two Visit Tree Base 懒
Still sitting on the second floor with a nightclub style

无 Baked vegetables: No meritorious or eggplant, no taste
每 Crab yellow stewed rice: Each grain of rice is wrapped with crab yellow, and a soft shell crab with a lot of meat is amazing
The beef tongue wide flat noodles: fried beef gruel adding taste on the side. Although the noodles are thick but very delicious, the beef tongue is soft and tender

The table and table are too close
Speech next door will interfere with hope and hope to improve"
"鮭魚義大利麵
比較重口味
微微辣

松露薯條
外酥內鬆軟
餐點都不錯吃

價位稍微高一些
義大利好像460左右
搭配套餐+180左右

午餐用餐在二樓
座位稍微有點擁擠
和鄰桌距離太近","Salva Italian Noodles
Heavier taste
Slightly spicy

Truffle fries
Crispy and soft inside
The meals are good

The price is slightly higher
Italy seems to be around 460
Set up meals +180

Lunch dinner on the second floor
The seat is a bit crowded
The distance from the neighboring table is too close"
牛舌麵味道個人無法接受，開胃菜份量都很少，飲料加了很多冰塊喝起來跟水一樣很沒有誠意，來這邊人均至少一千，但餐點品質真的很普，可以來跟朋友吃氛圍，但是就品質和價格來說，這個價位有更多更好的選擇。,"The taste of beef tongue is unacceptable, and the appetizers are very small. The drink adds a lot of ice cubes to drink as sincere as water. At least 1,000 people come here, but the quality of the meal is really universal. You can follow it. Friends eat atmosphere, but in terms of quality and price, there are more and better choices at this price."
酒不錯喝，但3樓不如照片漂亮，旁邊東西雜亂堆了很多東西，而且樓下的人都在3樓抽菸，有夠臭！在這邊喝酒真的不推，有點失望。,"The wine is good to drink, but the 3rd floor is not as beautiful as the photo. The things next to it have a lot of things, and the people downstairs smoke on the 3rd floor. It is smelly!Drinking here is really not pushed, a little disappointed."
"套餐附的水果狀況很糟，像是撞傷和冷藏過久。
主餐燉飯的溫度不夠，溫溫的熱度。手工寬義大利麵還不錯吃，牛舌薄片軟嫩好吃，但是塊狀部位偏硬難咬，我才應該是前端部位，需要更多時間燉煮。","The fruits attached to the package are very bad, like injuries and refrigeration for too long.
The temperature of the main meal stew is not enough, warm and warm.Hand -wide and long noodles are not bad. The beef tongue is soft and delicious, but the block -shaped part is hard and difficult to bite. I should be the front -end part, and it takes more time to stew."
看了好久的店，真的沒讓人失望，軟殼蟹燉飯很好吃，生菜沙拉比較特別，是一整顆生菜在裡面，醬料不錯，松露薯條味道很夠，餐廳服務也很好，推薦！,"After watching the shop for a long time, it is really not disappointing. The soft -shell crab stew is delicious. The lettuce salad is more special. It is a whole lettuce inside. The sauce is good. Okay, recommend!"
用餐環境很 chill，整體燈光氛圍是偏昏暗的，每樣料理都很好吃，松露薯條份量真的太小了，店家賺爛。,"The dining environment is very chill. The overall lighting atmosphere is dim. Each dish is delicious. The amount of truffles is really small, and the shops make rotten."
頂樓似乎沒有什麼裝潢，算是一間簡單的酒吧，調酒並沒有很多種類，比較像是local bar的感覺,There seems to be no decoration on the top floor. It is a simple bar. There are not many types of bartending.
天氣好可以訂位戶外座位吧檯，氣氛輕鬆好聊天,"If the weather is good, you can book outdoor seat bar, the atmosphere is easy to chat"
"跟朋友們來，一致覺得牛排很好吃值得推薦。但牛排要等比較久，可以來之前先告知預定。店員（店長？）說是請到某知名牛排餐廳的廚師過來。
青醬干貝燉飯也很不錯，干貝新鮮帶著煎出焦香。烤蔬菜好吃值得點。三樓的bar 有部分露天的桌椅與植栽，滿適合聚會聊天～","Come with friends, unanimously feel that the steak is delicious and recommended.But the steak should be waited for a long time, you can inform the book before you come.The clerk (store manager?) He said he was invited to the chef of a well -known steak restaurant.
Green sauce dried scallops are also very good. The scallops are fresh with a fragrant fragrance.Baked vegetables are delicious.There are some open tables and chairs and plants on the third floor, which is suitable for party chat ~"
"松露薯條可以、辣雞翅的醬真的有辣，配地瓜很特別。飲品普普～
但服務很好","Todgeflains can be spicy, spicy chicken wings sauce is really spicy, and the sweet potatoes are very special.Drink Pupu ~
But the service is very good"
我們有事先在網路訂位，但用餐時仍有滿多空位～雖然店家有收服務費，但是服務都蠻被動的，入座後並不會主動提供水，要自己跟服務人員要才會有，當天觀察到其他桌的客人也有遇到這個問題，而且也完全不會幫忙補水，需要一直找服務員…，然後餐點也是等了世界久🫠我點的酪梨吐司很好吃，但是份量少，甜點提拉米蘇的酒味較重，不過很好吃是大人的口味，酒漬櫻桃熔岩蛋糕上桌前會加熱十分鐘，味道不錯，可是挖下去完全沒有熔岩流心，裡面還是固體的巧克力蛋糕，吃起來也溫溫的，最後的泰奶布丁上面加了椰子片，我們都沒有很喜歡，不喜歡椰子相關製品的朋友要注意哦⚠️整體CP值偏低，不會再訪～,"We have booked a place on the Internet in advance, but we still have a lot of vacancy during the meal ~ Although the store has a service fee, the service is quite passive. After the seat, we will not actively provide water. The guests who observed other tables on that day also encountered this problem, and they would not help to replenish water at all. I needed to find a waiter ... Then the meal also waited for the long -lasting avocado toast. Without the taste of dessert Tiramisu, it is very delicious, but it is the taste of adults. The wine -stained cherry lava cake will be heated for ten minutes before serving. The chocolate cake is also warm. The last Thai milk pudding is added with coconut slices. We do n’t like it very much. Friends who do n’t like coconut -related products should pay attention ⚠️ The overall CP value is low, and we will not visit again ~"
5/17透過網路預定，到了現場才知道2樓有部份位置被包場，我們的位置被安排在角落，明明是很有氣氛的餐酒館，卻因爲包場讓我整晚感覺像在熱炒店用餐，當我們向現場服務生表達是否能請包場的顧客降低音量，卻被告知那是店長的朋友！我們也是花錢消費的客人，就因爲是店長的朋友，我們就只能默默接受嗎？如果有包場，是否同場地就不應該再安排其他客人，感受很差！建議訂位後，再致電問清楚當日是否有包場，避免破壞自己用餐的心情。,"5/17 Book through the Internet, only when I arrived at the scene, I knew that some of the positions on the second floor were charged. Our position was arranged in the corner. It was obviously a very atmospheric restaurant and tavern. When we meal fried restaurants, when we express whether the customers who can invite the on -site waiters to reduce the volume, they are told that it is the friend of the manager!We are also guests who spend money. Because of the friends of the store manager, can we only accept it silently?If there is a charter, you should not arrange other guests in the same venue, and feel bad!It is recommended that after ordering, then call to ask if there is a charter that day to avoid destroying the mood of your dining."
"🙋 2023/06｜第一次來訪 為家人慶生🥳
二樓室內空間非常舒適 氣氛很好！

我們自己準備小蛋糕 店家提供冷藏服務✨
上蛋糕時特別用心將我們的蛋糕擺飾好漂亮
更貼心的插上蠟燭 真的好美呀！😍

今天點的餐點都非常美味很喜歡！
口感和調味都很有層次
風味濃郁卻不膩口 😋

整體服務與體驗非常棒！
未來會經常回訪🥳

🙋 2023/09 二次回訪
這次選擇三樓戶外吧台區

晚上氛圍不錯適合聊天小酌
夏天稍微悶熱但有提供室外風扇

最可惜的是吧台並非禁煙區
因此會聞到其他客人的二手菸或電子菸😞
若要選擇戶外區請再斟酌

戶外吧台區僅一位bartender 兼服務人員
人力稍微不足 若有需求需稍微等一下
但整體服務仍是不錯的
餐點一樣好吃😋","2023/06 ｜ The first visit is to celebrate the birthday of the family
The indoor space on the second floor is very comfortable and the atmosphere is very good!

We prepare a small cake store ourselves to provide refrigerated services ✨
When I put on the cake, I specially put our cakes beautifully
It's so beautiful to insert the candle more intimately!Bleak

The meals I ordered today are very delicious!
The taste and seasoning are very layered
The flavor is rich but not greasy 郁

The overall service and experience are great!
In the future, I will visit frequently 常 常 常 常

二 2023/09 Two -return visit
This time, choose the third floor outdoor bar area

The atmosphere is good at night, suitable for chatting and drinking
Summer in summer but providing outdoor fans

The most unfortunate thing is that the bar is not a smoking area
So I will smell the second -hand cigarette or electronic cigarette of other guests 😞
If you want to choose an outdoor area, please consider it again

Only one Bartender and service staff in the outdoor bar area
Slightly insufficient manpower If you need it, wait a bit
But the overall service is still good
The meals are as delicious 一样"
本來看評價有些擔心踩雷，實際來訪～服務、餐點、酒類滿意到不行耶！！7:30前還有指定紅/白/酒、啤酒買一送一，搭餐、小酌都超划算！,"At first, the evaluation was a little worried about stepping on the thunder, and the actual visit ~ service, meal, wine is satisfied!IntersectionBefore 7:30, there are also designated red/white/wine and beer to buy one get one free."
餐點好吃，上菜速度快，服務人員也很貼心。下次會再訪，炸雞翅、蟹黃燉飯必點。,"The meal is delicious, the food is fast, and the service staff is very intimate.Will visit again next time, fried chicken wings and crab yellow stewed rice must be ordered."
"蟹黃燉飯跟干貝燉飯好好吃
點紅酒也是好喝到不行","Crab yellow stewed rice and dried scallop stew, delicious rice
Lian red wine is also delicious"
"今天6人聚餐，店內裝潢漂亮，座位寬敞，燈光明暗很適合喝酒🍺，相當不錯。

搭配方案19:30前點啤酒有買一送一，點了店內特調香檳和四季啤酒，香檳入口順滑，四季啤酒也很不錯👍。

點了燉飯、雞翅、義大利麵、薯條一起吃，餐點都滿好吃都的，份量比較精緻，建議配酒吃😁😁😁
是個下班小酌聚會的不錯選擇👏推薦給喜歡喝酒的朋友😁😁😁","Today, six people dinner, the interior of the shop is beautiful, the seats are spacious, and the lights and darkness are suitable for drinking. It is pretty good.

The matching scheme 19:30 Before ordering beer, buy one get one free, ordered the special champagne and four seasons beer in the store, the champagne is smooth, and the four seasons beer is also very good.

Eat stew, chicken wings, pasta, and fries to eat together. The meals are delicious and delicious.
It's a good choice of a drinking party for get off work. I recommend it to friends who like to drink."
"這家餐廳是一棟三層樓的建築，每一層坪數都不大，給人一種小巧精緻的感覺✨

餐廳內的裝潢營造出浪漫氣氛，很適合情侶和夫妻一起用餐、慶祝節日❤️
來訪的時間點剛好在情人節，就點了情人節套餐，蠻值得一試的！

• 鵝肝慕斯普切塔：很特別的口感！上面還有放上用紅酒醃過的梨子，很好吃！

• 舒肥雞肉沙拉：雞肉的口感很綿密，還不錯

• 松露卡布奇諾：以卡布奇諾的形式來呈現松露濃湯，上層有奶泡的口感，隨餐附上的麵包配上松露奶油醬，超好吃❤️必點‼️

• 紐約客牛排：超好吃！！！除了紐約客外，裡面還有番茄、玉米筍、大蒜和薯泥，薯泥超好吃❤️此生吃過最好吃的薯泥，牛排也很好吃，但光是薯泥就可以讓我再點一次❗️

• 泰式奶茶布丁：上面有西米露，相較之下比較普通

• 啤酒：當天有買一送一，一杯400ml，爽口好喝

活動慶功宴來用餐，餐廳氣氛很好，酒也好喝,"The event celebrating the meal, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very good, and the wine is also delicious"
"來Lazy Point大概三次了，兩次都是聖誕節前後跟朋友來聚餐，
最近一次是吃他們家的早午餐。
來那麼多次，一直都有看到他們的菜單在做變化，創新。
是一家會經常回訪的店。 :)","I have come to Lazy Point for about three times, and twice is a meal with friends around Christmas twice.
The last time I eat their brunch.
Come here many times, I have seen their menus changing and innovation.
It is a shop that can return frequently.:)"
"要不是有一顆🌟
不然真的連一星都不想給
我們是預約1/19中午的客人
我朋友先到，在我十分鐘前
點了一分主餐螃蟹燉飯、桂花奶茶、雞翅
而我後來點了圖片上這個燉飯、西西里咖啡、薯條
圖片上這個燉飯超難吃…有夠鹹，我起初以為是我自己的問題，給我朋友吃一口也說太鹹，這個要400塊的主餐比我家巷口哪種80塊燉飯調味還失敗，西西里咖啡以為是我阿嬤逼我喝中藥。

再來是本次最糟糕的體驗，服務品質之差，真的此生不會來，原本我朋友是抱著有草莓的早午餐活動去的，到現場才發現沒有草莓早午餐系列🥲，想說其他餐點應該也可結果我的豬排燉飯難吃。
1.我朋友點的蟹味燉飯完全沒有上，等了三十分鐘後問店員，店員說不好意思廚房沒有點到，有夠誇張，會有客人指點小點不點主餐嗎？？？
2.二樓整間只有一個看起來就是PT的店員，欸你們不是100塊便當店，一個中午時段員工外場只有一個人？？？完全不夠，當天二樓高朋滿座，一個外場完全沒辦法即時供應客人的需求。
3.我點了桂花奶茶，十分鐘後店員跟我說：「不好意思我們的桂花奶茶上面的糰子沒了，能不能幫你換棉花糖。」當然不行啊，我幹嘛來這邊吃不是原餐點的東西…問題是一開始店員也沒即時告知糰子🍡沒了，真的好誇張…後來換咖啡還真的後悔😞
4.店員因為不小心沒點到朋友主餐，沒有一開始就道歉，30分鐘後來討罵…說要送我們提拉米蘇，真的看得出這家店毫末的誠意啦，但我們真的沒心情吃這種東西了。
5.結束還敢收10%服務費…哇噻第一次看到這種價位的餐廳出錯還敢收客人服務費的，當作是被詐騙，此生不會再來","If it weren't for a puppet
Otherwise, I really don't even want to give a star
We are guests who make an appointment at noon at noon
My friend arrived first, ten minutes ago
Over the main meal, crab stew, osmanthus milk tea, chicken wings
And I later ordered this stew, Sicily coffee, fries
This stew on the picture is very unpalatable ... It's salty enough. I thought it was my own problem at first. I said it was too salty for my friend. Failure, Sicily coffee thought it was my grandma forced me to drink Chinese medicine.

Then there is the worst experience in this time. The difference in service quality. I really won't come in this life. Originally, my friend had a brunch event with strawberries. I found that there was no strawberry brunch series. The meal should also be unpalatable for my pork chop stew.
1. The crab -flavored stewed rice I ordered by my friend was not on. After 30 minutes, the clerk was asked. The clerk said that he was embarrassed to order the kitchen. If it was exaggerated, would there be guests in order to give a little or order the main meal?IntersectionIntersection
2. There is only one clerk who looks like PT on the second floor. 欸 You are not a 100 -library shop. There is only one person in the outdoor field of an employee in one noon?IntersectionIntersectionIt was completely not enough. On the second floor of the day, there was no way to supply guests at all.
3. I ordered osmanthus milk tea. After ten minutes, the clerk told me, ""I'm sorry for the dumplings on our osmanthus milk tea, can I help you change marshmallows."" What is the original meal ... The problem is that at the beginning, the clerk did not immediately inform the Tuanzi of the Tuanzi, which was really exaggerated ... Later, the coffee was really regretted 😞
4. The clerk did not order the main meal because he accidentally ordered the main meal. He didn't apologize at the beginning. After 30 minutes, he scolded ... I said that I would send us to Tiramisu. I have no mood to eat this kind of thing.
5. At the end, I dare to charge a 10%service fee ... Wow, the first time I saw the restaurant at this price, I dared to charge the guest service fee."
東西好吃是好吃，但牛排等了一個半小時左右…雖然有說明廚師因手法有自己的堅持，但真的太久了😅😅 卡布奇諾濃湯+酸奶麵包佐松露起司醬非常讚！軟殼蟹燉飯也滿驚豔的～,"It ’s delicious, but the steak waits for about an hour and a half ... Although there are explanations that the chef has his own persistence because of his own way, it’ s really too long. praise!Soft -shell crab stew rice is also amazing ~"
"•松露薯條
•炸雞翅
•辣炒小章魚
•軟殼蟹燉飯
還有點了一杯泰奶的調酒🍹

整體而言CP值不高，食物的份量連小鳥胃的女生朋友吃完主餐，都還會餓耶😅
(朋友他們點的主餐，吃完都說很普通)

有個辣炒小章魚的菜色很好吃～
喜歡吃辣的人可以點看看！
但其他的菜就普普通通，不難吃但也沒有到美味。

另外，泰奶的調酒讓人很失望，
朋友喝完都說完全是感冒糖漿的味道，
最後我連三分之一都沒喝到，也不敢再點其他酒類了，真的很怕會雷。","• Truckflalers
• Fried chicken wings
• Spicy fried small octopus
• Soft shell crab stew rice
There is also a cup of Thai milk bartending 🍹

On the whole, the CP value is not high.
(Friends, they ordered the main meal, they said that it is very ordinary after eating)

There is a spicy fried small octopus dish is delicious ~
People who like spicy food can click to see!
But other dishes are ordinary, not difficult to eat but not delicious.

In addition, Thai milk is disappointed,
Friends say that after drinking, it is a taste of a cold syrup,
In the end, I didn't even drink one -third, and I didn't dare to order other wines. I was really afraid of thunder."
"風景好 氣氛佳 非常適合拍照
傍晚的光景
與晚餐時段 有非常不同的變化
很適合來拍網美照

餐點的部份也不錯
烤蔬菜、手工寬麵味道都不錯
尤其是菇風味的醬汁 帶點微酸感
搭上芝麻葉與烤牛舌
還蠻好吃的

而蟹黃燉飯…不推
沒有蟹黃味… 不知道這粉紅色的醬汁怎麼能跟蟹黃扯上關聯？！

季節鮮魚是紅甘 口感 熟度都很棒
但醬汁太酸…讓干貝與海瓜子口感都變得有的澀澀的
小可惜
好喜歡秋葵❤️

熔岩蛋糕…
搭酒漬櫻桃很好吃
如果是配冰淇淋而不是鮮奶油
我覺得會更好吃

夜景真的很美❤️
下次來喝酒","The scenery is good and the atmosphere is very suitable for taking pictures
Evening scene
There are very different changes from dinner time
It's very suitable to take the photos of the net

The part of the meal is also good
Baked vegetables and handmade wide noodles are good
Especially mushroom -flavored sauce with a little bit of acidity
Put on sesame leaves and grilled beef tongue
Pretty delicious

And crab yellow stewed rice ... not push
No crab yellow flavor ... I don't know how this pink sauce can be associated with crab yellow?Intersection

Seasonal fresh fish is a great taste of redness.
But the sauce is too sour ... Make the taste of scallops and sea melon seeds astringent
It's a pity
I really like Okra ❤️

Lava cake ...
It's delicious with wine staining cherry
If it is equipped with ice cream instead of fresh cream
I think it will be more delicious

The night scene is really beautiful ❤️
Come to drink next time"
非常完美的體驗開放包場，服務讓人非常窩心❤️,"Very perfect experience open charter, service is very hearty ❤️"
"✅禮拜天電話預約17:30挺早的所以都還有位子！

✅作為舒適、乾淨！
✅廁所也是非常乾淨
✅洗手台也很有特色！（忘記拍照了）
✅上餐速度很快，且餐點很有特色！

👍🏻想特別推薦柚子青醬燉飯，第一次吃到這麼好吃的青醬燉飯，酸鹹的口感真的是讓人讚不絕口！干貝也是煎的非常剛好，鮮嫩多汁！
👍🏻和友人一起點了調酒喝，友人希望喝甜一點的調酒，於是店家就幫我們做了菜單上沒有的調酒！友人非常喜歡（很難得！）
👍🏻當天到19:30以前松露薯條有優惠🤣
👍🏻巧克力熔岩蛋糕也大推！！超級好吃😋

⚠️附近非常不好停車（汽機車都是）
⚠️進門後有一個小台階，店家也會即時提醒！
⚠️覺得泰奶布丁吃起來比較多是上面椰果（？）的味道🤣反而沒什麼泰奶的味道了

沒有吃到墨魚麵好可惜，但好吃到絕對會想去二訪的店！！推薦給大家👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻","1 On Sunday, the call is made up 17:30, so there are still seats!

快 The meal is fast, and the meal is very distinctive!

I want to especially recommend grapefruit green sauce stewing rice. For the first time, I ate such delicious green sauce stewing rice. The sour and salty taste is really praised!The scallops are also very fried, fresh and juicy!
I ordered the bartending and drinking with my friends. Friends hope to drink a sweet bartending, so the store helped us make the bartender not on the menu!Friends like it very much (very rare!)
0 On the same day, before 19:30, there was a discount for truffle fans.
岩 Chocolate lava cake is also pushed!IntersectionSuper delicious

停️ Very bad parking nearby (all the auto motorcycles are)
个️ After entering the door, there is a small step, and the store will remind immediately!
丁️ I think the Thai milk pudding tastes more. The flavor of coconut fruit above (?) Instead, there is no taste of Thai milk.

It's a pity not to eat cuttlefish noodles, but it will definitely want to go to the second visit to the second visit when it is delicious!IntersectionRecommend to everyone"
食物好吃氣氛佳， 州子街約會小聚首選，套餐建議要付甜點。,"The food is delicious, and the preferred choice for dating in the prefecture is recommended. It is recommended to pay desserts."

"相當別緻典雅也所費不貲的餐酒館。食物好吃、酒也好喝，氣氛悠閒，是很不錯的好店。不過銀彈所費不貲。

----------
【辣炒小章魚】
小章魚口感彈牙，滋味微辣，很好吃。

【摩洛哥綜合烤肉串】
分別是牛、豬、雞3種肉串（每串各3大塊），還加上一點小米作為點綴。因為香料太厚了，吃不出炭烤的味道、甚至吃不出是哪種肉，不推。

【蒜香蘑菇鮮蝦】
蘑菇和蝦子的份量都很足，調味和擺盤也都很美觀。

【辣味起司肉丸】
4顆肉丸 + 2塊麵包的組合；肉丸的質地還頗堅韌彈牙，不是鬆垮垮漢堡肉的口感，內部包藏融化的起司；帶有辣味的是上頭的番茄紅醬，相當不錯。

【松露奶油蘑菇烤麵包】
我超愛這個的！麵包本身外皮焦脆，中間的奶油蘑菇味道很新鮮且熱呼呼的，蘑菇很厚，吃起來很過癮，用麵包沾來吃更是美味。

【法式小羔羊】
很棒的羊肉料理，完全吃不出來是羊肉，既軟又嫩；旁邊的蔬菜也調理得很好吃，搭配磨得很細緻的馬鈴薯泥，很是特別。

【香橙鴨胸】
這道菜等得有點久（還以為沒點到呢，問過後才知道需要比較久的時間烹調），好吃到我猛抓友人尖叫的一道料理！被半熟鴨肉鎖住的肉汁讓這道料理更添美味，旁邊的烤蔬菜也相當不錯。

【六次回溫菲力】5oz
肉質超鮮嫩味美，搭醬汁或粗鹽都很棒。

【雙貝白酒蒜香細扁麵】
麵條本身頗普通，不過調味很不錯，相當好吃。

【酥炸軟殼蟹黃燉飯】
軟殼蟹已經處理得非常軟嫩，可以直接食用無礙；燉飯本體與蟹黃充分融合，味道相當濃郁。

【松阪豬牛肝菌燉飯】
松阪豬的肉質堅韌味美，底下的燉飯也充分入味，佐以牛肝菌醬，相當不錯。

【芋頭團子】
芋粿味，口感很Q，帶有濃厚的蝦皮與香菇風味，還加上我超愛的溫泉蛋。

【煙燻鮭魚沙拉】
燻鮭魚片捲成花朵的形狀後表面稍微炙燒，帶出焦香氣味；肉片頗具厚度，鮭魚卵也很濃郁，相當不錯；淋醬酸甜適中，能多一點會更好。

【香草冰淇淋】
還挺不錯。

【拿鐵】
用熱拿鐵醒酒，味道相當不錯，奶泡也很厚，旁邊還附了一塊現烤餅乾。

【桂花奶茶】
附上一串熱熱的烤三色糰子，和帶有桂花風味的微甜奶茶很搭。

【莫西多】
很不錯的經典調酒，不過冰塊用得不少，不快點喝完，杯子底下就會溼答答。

【邁泰】
上面的花朵是直接剪用櫃台旁花瓶內的花朵使用，是富有熱帶風情的一杯經典調酒，這裡調製的味道也很不錯。

【卡琵莉亞】
酸酸甜甜，酒感中等偏輕。

【藝妓】
主體是梅酒風味，一旁的煙燻桂圓為這杯酒增添了微焦的香甜氣味，很特別。

【太妃蘋果馬丁尼】
味道真的很蘋果，酒位不重，很酸甜好喝；上面的蘋果片也很新鮮。

【含苞待放】
很不厲害的一杯調酒（酒保特地推薦，酒精含量最低），但很弱的友人還是花了很久的時間才攻克它。基底根本就是玫瑰水，帶有濃郁的玫瑰香氣。

【藍色夏威夷】
熱帶水果風味，微酸微甜，酒感輕。

【熱帶風浪】
熱帶水果風味，酒感中等偏輕。

【烏龍茶之鄉】
烏龍茶感不太重，滋味酸甜，酒感中等。

【布列塔尼的日光浴】
水果風味、甜微酸、酒感中等偏輕。

【麻六甲的祈禱】
熱帶水果與香料風味、酒感中等偏輕。

【漂浮湄公河】
草本風味，滋味清爽、酒感中等偏輕。

【特調】
酒感很輕，漸層的色彩相當夢幻，花是現剪現用的。

【特調】熱帶水果風味
以等頗具熱帶元素的水果結合而成的特調，很好喝。

【特調】柳橙風味
以柳橙汁為基底的特調，類似Sunset的味道，頗淡。","It's quite unique and elegant.The food is delicious, the wine is delicious, and the atmosphere is leisurely. It is a very good shop.However, the silver bomb is not expensive.

The small octopus is elastic, the taste is slightly spicy, and it is delicious.

They are three kinds of meat skewers (each of each skewers) of beef, pig, and chicken, and a little millet as embellishment.Because the spice is too thick, you ca n’t eat the taste of charcoal roasted, or even what kind of meat it is, and do n’t push it.

This dish has waited a little (I thought I didn't order it, and I knew it would take a long time to cook it after asking). It was so delicious that I had a dish that I screamed with my friends!The gravy locked by the half -cooked duck meat makes this dish more delicious, and the grilled vegetables next to it are also pretty good.

Lazy Point 新品牌的餐酒館，晚上的酒吧新增了餐食，非常棒，特別感謝老闆 Ryan 與 店長 Bill 無微不至的照料，是一個非常有熱忱與實力的 Bar。內湖酒吧的最佳選擇。,"Lazy Point's new brand of restaurants, the bars have added meals at night, which is great. I especially thank the boss Ryan and the store manager Bill's meticulous care. It is a very enthusiastic and powerful BAR.The best choice for Neihu Bar."
"空間很棒 整體座位很舒適
摩洛哥烤雞/戈根佐拉起司燉飯非常對我的胃👍🏻✨
友人的千層肉醬麵味道很濃郁，但個人還好
飲品普通發揮
吃氣氛和環境，聚會的好地點👍🏻
但個人喜愛lazy point的白天大於夜晚🌞
裝潢、氣氛和白天的陽光很ok👌🏻
燉飯也推👌🏻會讓我想二訪嘗試其他餐點的餐廳🌟🌟🌟
餐點比對面的卡啡那優😂雖然性質不同😵‍💫

二訪
點了鵝肝醬的開胃菜&烤雞翅
覺得兩個餐點都偏普通，還是戈根佐拉起司燉飯最優👍🏻
這次是鮪魚濃湯也偏普通
另外，飲品選項偏少
熔岩巧克力蛋糕普通還行👌🏻","The space is great, the overall seat is very comfortable
Moroccan grilled chicken/Gogenla cheese stew is very to my stomach 👍🏻✨
Friends’s thousand -layer meat sauce noodles have a strong taste, but person is okay
Drinks are ordinary
Eating atmosphere and environment, a good place for the party 👍🏻
But personally loves Lazy Point during the day greater than night 🌞
Decoration, atmosphere and daylight are OK 装
Stew rice also pushes 我 will make me want to visit the restaurant with other meals in the second visit 🌟🌟🌟
The meal is better than the opposite Kamami. Although the nature is different, 😵‍💫

Second visit
Order the appetizer & grilled chicken wings of foie gras
I think both meals are ordinary, or the best 👍🏻
This time it is also the sturgeon soup.
In addition, there are fewer drink options
Lava chocolate cake is still okay 👌🏻"
"餐廳位於內湖洲子街，一整棟建築物非常大氣！餐點擺盤很美，特別推薦戈根佐起司燉飯，上面的雞腿調料非常美味～也因為太好吃又我們再點了第二份🤤
下次想來吃吃看早午餐！ …","The restaurant is located in Neihuzhouzi Street. A whole building is very atmospheric!The meal is very beautiful, and I recommend that Gogenzo's cheese stewed rice. The chicken leg seasonings on it are very delicious ~ Because of being too delicious, we ordered the second copy.
I want to come and eat brunch next time!Mowing"
"今天這個雞腿燉飯，居然是沒有骨頭的！超級貼心，讓我付服務費也願意🙌🏼

廁所乾淨！","Today this chicken leg stew, there is no bone!Super intimate, let me pay the service fee and willing

The toilet is clean!"
餐點比想像中來的美味，剛好遇到晚上7:30前還有啤酒類買一送一，非常划算！不過薯條份量有點少。,"The meal is more delicious than expected. It just happened to buy one get one free before 7:30 pm, which is very cost -effective!However, the amount of fries is a bit small."
"藏身於內科一角，是個燈光美氣氛佳的餐酒館。當天點了以下餐點：

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻綜合炒菇
包含了杏苞菇、蘑菇、鮮香菇，以及扇貝，以九層塔、蒜、洋蔥等料理。個人很喜歡，像三杯菇，濃郁偏鹹，重口味、下酒好選擇。

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻白酒蛤蜊義大利麵
此道表現普通，就是它該有的樣子。

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻松露卡布奇諾
松露蕈菇湯，因為有一層類似奶泡的東西，口感很像卡布奇諾，算特別的體驗，湯本身表現正常。直得一提的是旁邊的麵包，濃郁的馬茲卡彭乳酪，好喜歡！

👍🏻👍🏻烤花椰菜
裏面的培根偏肥，有點像三層肉，不敢吃。奶油白醬為基底，但是不夠濃，覺得好像稀釋過。

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻蟹黃燉飯
本餐最愛！軟殼蟹炸得香酥，蟹黃燉飯本身味道香濃豐富，米的硬度適中，襯上些許毛豆，推！","Hidden in the corner of the Department of Internal Medicine is a tavern with a beautiful light atmosphere.Ordered the following meals that day:

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Comprehensive mushrooms
It contains alpine mushrooms, mushrooms, fresh shiitake mushrooms, and scallops, with nine -layer tower, garlic, onion and other dishes.Personally like it, like three glasses of mushrooms, rich and salty, heavy taste, good wine choice.

大 Baijiu clam pasta
This performance is ordinary, which is what it should have.

👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Flash Kabikino
Tulu mushroom soup, because there is a layer of milk -like things, the taste is very similar to Kabchino, which is a special experience. The soup itself is normal.It is mentioned that the bread next to it, the rich Mazca Peng cheese, I like it!

👍🏻👍🏻 grilled cauliflower
The bacon inside is fat, a bit like three layers of meat, and dare not eat.Cream white sauce is the base, but it is not thick enough, it seems like diluted.

Crab yellow stewed rice
Favorite this meal!The soft shell crab is fried crispy, the crab yellow stewed rice itself is rich and rich, and the hardness of the rice is moderate."
"環境舒適,餐點中規中矩,價格適中

松露薯條 =>沒有特別好或不好
鵝肝慕斯普切塔=>份量有點少,鵝肝味道很重
蟹黃燉飯=>剛開始會覺得分量有點少,但是吃到一半就飽了
清炒白酒義大利麵=>中規中矩
牛舌義大利手工寬麵=>可能是裡面味道最好的一到料理,值得推薦

少一顆星是因為我們坐在2樓,只有一位服務人員,中午時間客人很多,一位無法服務所有客人,點菜等菜上桌都必須等待相當久的時間.
另外一點是店家沒有注意的,客人沒到前,水杯都已經裝滿水了
這是相當不專業,也不及格的做法.","The environment is comfortable, the meal is quite satisfactory, and the price is moderate

Tulu French fries => No particularly good or bad
Goose liver mouspta => The portion is a bit small, and the foie gras is very heavy
Crab yellow stewed rice => At first, I feel that the amount is a bit less, but it will be full after half of it
Stir -fried liquor pasta => satisfactory
Beef tongue Italian handmade wide noodles => may be the best taste in it, it is worth recommending

One less star is because we are sitting on the second floor, there is only one service staff, there are many guests at noon, one cannot serve all guests, or ordering and other dishes must wait for a long time.
The other point is that the store did not pay attention. The guests did not arrive before, the water cup was already filled with water
This is quite unprofessional and failed."
松露卡布奇諾很濃醇好喝，餐點很精緻，中午就有提供不同種類的特色啤酒、紅白酒，適合約會的好地點！,"Tulu Kabchino is very strong and delicious, and the meals are exquisite. At noon, there are different types of characteristic beer, red and white wine, which is suitable for a good place for dating!"
"第一次來，在內湖科學園區這個忙碌擁擠的地方，有這麼一家標榜來發懶的餐酒館，這家餐酒館的裝潢讓人很放鬆，無論白天或晚上，可能是點綴在天花板的大面積乾燥植栽，又或者是落地窗外的視野沒想像中擁擠，畢竟這是一棟位在沒有一處是商辦的內湖州子街上的餐酒館。
可以選擇的餐點太多樣，網路上的評價也都不錯，所以簡單分享這次我點了兩個前菜一個主食，其中蟹黃燉飯我個人蠻喜歡。
本次餐點：
蟹黃燉飯
爐烤海螺
燻鮭魚沙拉
熱帶海島水果茶
白日夢","For the first time, in this busy and crowded place in Neihu Science Park, there is such a lazy dining tavern. The decoration of this dining tavern is very relaxed. Whether during the day or evening The area is dry, or the field of vision outside the floor -to -ceiling window is not crowded. After all, this is a dining tavern on the streets of Neihu Prefecture, where there is no place.
The meals that can be selected are too diverse, and the evaluations on the Internet are also good, so I simply shared that I ordered two previous dishes and a staple food. Among them, I personally like crab yellow stew.
This meal:
Crab yellow stewed rice
Baked conch
Smoked salmon salad
Tropical island fruit tea
Daydream"

很chill，下班過來3F吧台特別浪漫，食物份量不多，但很有飽足感，而且性價比挺好。不推薦點肉的main dish，雖然好吃，但因為份量太少而且特別貴。甜點算是半成品，所以還有下一攤的人，記得提前10分鐘跟服務員說一聲，我們因為等了一陣子，服務員送了我們三杯shot，哈哈哈。,"Very Chill. After get off work, the 3F bar is particularly romantic. The food is not large, but it is full and the price is very good.Main Dish, which is not recommended, although it is delicious, it is too small and very expensive.Desserts are semi -finished products, so there are people in the next stall.

餐點份量看似不多，沒想到吃起來意外的相當有飽足感。店員推薦的牛舌手工寬麵吸了滿滿的特製牛骨醬汁，厚切牛舌超好吃。野莓法式吐司也好好食，酸酸甜甜一點都不膩口，重點是店內像是有施魔法一樣，十分的悠哉又舒適，寵物友善，可以帶家中毛孩一起。下次要找happy hour的時間去喝啤酒買一送一🥰 …,"The meal seems to be not much, but I did not expect that it was quite full.The beef tongue recommended by the clerk sucks full of special beef bone sauce, and the thick cut beef tongue is super delicious.Wildberry French toast is also good, sour and sweet, not greasy at all.

食物好吃 燉飯份量好少@@ 價格偏貴 二樓一位濃妝服務生態度有點不敢恭維。我們入座時是唯一一組客人 但不管我們要加水還是要點餐還是到處參觀 這位服務生一直臭臉說：稍等一下。二樓外場這樣一個人是否太少？才會讓客人一直需要承擔服務生的工作情緒？,"The food is delicious and the stewed rice is small @@ 食 食 食 食 The ecosystem of a thick makeup service on the second floor is a bit dare to compliment.When we were in the seat, we were the only group of guests, but whether we had to add water or ordered or ordered the waiter everywhere, the waiter always stunned and said: Wait a while.Is there too little people on the second floor?Only can guests always need to bear the work emotion of the waiter?"
"位在內湖科學園區的酒吧，環境營造的很美，小點點心松露薯條、炸雞翅味道都很棒，適合搭配酒品。
露天的座位晚上比較涼，服務生會提供毛毯，很貼心。","The bar located in the Neihu Science Park, the environment is very beautiful, with small snack truffle potato strips and fried chicken wings. It is suitable for wine.

在二樓用餐時，可以眺望隔壁辦公室正在加班的人。我悠閒的坐在這邊吃晚餐，就覺得食物跟甜點滿讚的 ( 不過是真的好吃😂， 擺盤也很美！ ) …,"When dining on the second floor, you can overlook the person who is working overtime next door.I sat here to eat dinner here, and I felt that the food and desserts were full of praise (but it's really delicious, the set is also beautiful!) ..."
"每一道都讓人驚艷，從前菜的taco 到主餐到煙花女義大利麵跟起司燉飯，到最後的提拉米蘇都給五顆星好評的好吃！
酒單也很有特色跟質感，點了吉隆坡，一開始有點微苦，喝到後面才慢慢比較順口～
整體裝潢跟氣氛也都很讚，上菜速度也很快，頂樓的酒吧台也很有氣氛很適合拍照！
絕對是一間會二訪的餐廳👍🏼 …","Each is amazing. From the taco of the previous dish to the main meal to the Fireworks Girl's pasta and the cheese stew with the cheese, to the final Tiramisu, the five stars are well received!
The wine list is also very distinctive and texture. I ordered Kuala Lumpur. At first, I was a little bit bitter.
The overall decoration and the atmosphere are also very good, and the speed of serving is also fast. The bar on the top floor is also very atmospheric and suitable for taking pictures!
It is definitely a restaurant for a second visit 👍🏼 ..."
餐點中上，擺盤有花些小心思。餐館氛圍偏陰暗，地點在內科，下班後想跟同事在比較安靜的環境聚餐可考慮這裡。,"In the meal, there are some careful thoughts.The atmosphere of the restaurant is dark, and the location is in the Department of Medicine. After get off work, you can consider here to dinner with colleagues at a relatively quiet environment."
很有特色的網美餐廳，食物賣相都很精美，也很好吃😋,"Very distinctive net beauty restaurant, the food sells is exquisite, and it is also delicious."
"#聽說晚上更美麗

#玉米濃湯超濃

#Lunch is also very full
#Is super thick
#The atmosphere is great suitable for taking pictures"
"想要慵懶舒適的用餐喝酒，很適合來Lazy Point，到處都可看到可愛的樹懶🦥～
餐廳文化非常鮮明，不過上菜速度超級快！（不用擔心跟樹懶一樣慢）
菜單設計每一頁都別出心裁（到底有多懶？😹）每一道菜都很驚艷，紅酒燉牛舌好好吃喔！！
酒單都有非常詳細貼心的口感介紹，3樓還有戶外酒吧露天座位，算是小隱密的餐廳，很適合約會或聚餐！服務也很不錯！處處看得到也體驗得到細節用心😊","If you want to eat and drink lazily and comfortably, it is very suitable for lazy point. You can see cute sloths everywhere ~
The restaurant culture is very distinctive, but the food is super fast!(Don't worry as slow as the sloth)
Each page of the menu design is ingenious (how lazy is it? 😹) Each dish is amazing, red wine stewed beef tongue is delicious!Intersection
The wine list has a very detailed and intimate taste introduction. On the 3rd floor, there is an outdoor bar open -air seat. It is a small hidden restaurant. It is very suitable for dating or dinner!The service is also very good!I can see it everywhere and experience the details 😊"
蟹黃奶油頓飯真的是極品，女兒很開心的說這是他有史以來吃過最好吃的燉飯，後來看到網路上對燉飯的評價也都非常的高，因為比較晚來，所以沒能好好看菜單，下次一定會準備跟充裕的時間來體驗。,"Crab yellow cream meal is really the best. My daughter is very happy to say that this is the best stewed rice he has eaten in history. Later, I saw that the evaluation of stewing rice on the Internet was also very high. Can't look at the menu well, you will definitely be prepared to experience with plenty of time next time."
"不得不說前菜沙拉都做得挺好的，
切半蘿蔓炭烤過帶炭香味，算是蠻新穎的凱薩沙拉呈現
炒野菇跟炒小章魚都做得不錯，雖然不明白野菇裡為何要加帆立貝

主餐的部分牛排處理普通，舒肥的處理熟度控制的還不錯。
但表面如果可以再多煎或烤一點賦予更多焦脆層就更好了。
紐約客上層的油筋 也沒煎軟 差了幾個意思。

另外由於我們是三人打算主餐分著吃，因此在上了第一道豬肉後想說可不可以廚房幫我們先做分切。

結果外場回來給我一個很帥的回答說：主廚的堅持，不能切，怕乾掉。當下也沒想什麼，有堅持是好事。

一片12oz 一片18oz的牛排在比他稍微大一點點的鑄鐵烤盤上端來，其實也沒什麼多餘的空間好切肉，畢竟不是平盤是有深度的烤盤，加上刀子真的很難切，紐約客的筋還有肋眼周圍的筋加上本身就是舒肥偏軟但又沒有脆殼的肋眼，說真的你在廚房用很利的刀子做厚切真的不太容易會乾掉，也比用不利的刀子在那邊擠壓擠壓肉都變形叉子也亂叉，誠心建議，如果要做這種堅持的話換個比較好的牛排刀吧。

其他部分都挺好的，然後啤酒頭的啤酒晚餐時段還有買一送一，推推～

Cut half of vines and baked the charcoal flavor, which is pretty novel
Both the fried wild mushrooms and the fried takoya are doing well, although I don’t understand why the wild mushrooms should be added to the sails.

Some of the steaks of the main meal are normal, and the cookedness control of Shu Fei is not bad.
But it is better if you can fried or bake more to give more crispy layers.
The oil tendons of the upper layer of New York did not have a few meanings.

In addition, since we are a three -person plan to eat the main meal, we want to say that after the first pork, can we say that the kitchen can help us make a score first.

As a result, I returned from the field to give me a handsome answer: The chef's persistence cannot be cut, afraid of killing.I didn't think about it at the moment. It is a good thing to persist.

A 12oz and 18oz steak on the upper end of the cast iron baking sheet that is slightly larger than him. In fact, there is no extra space to cut meat. The tendons of the New Yorker and the ribs around the rib eyes and the rib eyes that are soft but not crispy. It is better than using a unfavorable knife to squeeze and squeeze the flesh. The fork is also chaotic. I sincerely suggest that if you want to do this kind of persistence, change to a better steak knife.

The other parts are very good, and then the beer head of the beer dinner period also buy one get one free, push push ~

"這次挑選了這家餐酒館來慶祝週年紀念日 覺得很不錯！
餐點很棒，還有happy hour 紅酒白酒買一送一活動，不過價位算蠻高的，但是跟一般餐酒館差不多！
用餐氣氛很棒，3樓還有是開放式的空中酒吧，可以在用餐後上去喝點小酒。
2樓用餐的地方空間設計很棒適合拍照，裝飾擺設都很用心。（尤其是廁所水龍頭的部分非常特別，這邊就不透露，留給大家自己前往發現）
挑高的空間設計讓人感覺輕鬆自在，雖然有三層樓，但是座位沒有到很多，我是平日晚上去，幾乎全部坐滿，建議要先訂位！店員服務態度良好親切！會讓人想再去的一家餐酒館！","I selected this restaurant to celebrate the anniversary this time. It is very good!
The meal is great, and there are happy hour red wine and liquor to buy one get one free activity, but the price is quite high, but it is similar to the average dining tavern!
The atmosphere of the meal is great. There is also an open air bar on the 3rd floor. You can drink a little wine after meals.
The space design on the 2nd floor is great for taking pictures, and the decoration is very careful.(Especially the part of the faucet of the toilet is very special, so I will not disclose it here.
The high space design makes people feel relaxed. Although there are three floors, the seats are not as many as there. I go to the evening, almost all of them are full.

"週五 19:00 進入感覺的到店裡很忙，座位擁擠聽得到左右別人的聊天，但聽不到坐在對面朋友說話的聲音。

點了松露薯條、依比利豬、手工寬麵、烤時蔬、調酒單上的調酒。

過一陣子服務生過來告知調酒已經賣完了（日光浴），週五晚上19：30就賣完了，真是熱門。

想要加水都不太好叫到人，主餐都要等 40 分鐘以上，結果等寬麵快吃完才上開胃菜薯條。

手工寬麵是所有餐點最好吃的。

我以為是網美 Bar，結果送上來的客製調酒（芭樂）的外觀滿讓人意外的。

總共吃了 2800 多，如果是第一次約會可以再考慮一下。","At 19:00 on Friday, I was very busy entering the feeling. The seats were crowded and heard the chat from others, but I couldn't hear the sound of sitting on the opposite friend.

Order the bartending of truffle fans, IV pigs, hand -wide noodles, grilled vegetables, and bartending lists.

After a while, the waiter came to inform the alcohol of the bartender (daylight bath), and it was sold at 19:30 on Friday night. It was really popular.

If you want to add water, you are not very good. You have to wait more than 40 minutes in the main meal.

Hand -wide noodles are the best meals.

I thought it was a net beauty BAR, and the appearance of the custom -made bartender (guava) was surprising.

A total of more than 2,800, if it is the first date, you can consider it again."

坐在3樓戶外區，好險剛好沒碰到抽菸的客人。喜歡松露卡布奇諾湯和烤時蔬，主菜燉飯和義大利麵不難吃但也說不上很喜歡。19:30前紅白酒和啤酒買一送一。點了白酒偏酸。,"Sitting on the outdoor area on the 3rd floor, good dangerous guests did not encounter smoking guests.I like truffle Kabchino soup and roasted time vegetables.

2021.03.28。回內科加班。附近餐廳吃點下午茶。店面佈置用心，面積不大，所以往樓上發展。頂樓BAR不錯，餐點份量不太多，價位在2～300附近，當午茶剛剛好。坐二樓，二桌客人，帥哥店員一位稍忙碌些，服務很親切客氣，點用餐點及咖啡送上後，稍微口渴詢問有水？帥哥也馬上發現水瓶水杯沒附上，很快來了一罐～餐點口味因人而異，份量大小也很主觀，但吃起來真的有點寂寞，因為味道沒有記憶感，有點空洞，很明顯用料可以多多加強，畢竟主力客群大多不是學生，一吃進嘴，好壞立馬就能知道，總的來說店東裝潢佈置上很用心～,"2021.03.28.Back to the Department of Science and Technology to work overtime.Eat some afternoon tea nearby.The store layout is attentive, and the area is not large, so it develops upstairs.The top floor is good, the meal is not too much, and the price is around 2 to 300.

"本來只是想找個地方和朋友聊天，食物和飲料的水準出乎意料的好！

七點之前啤酒和紅白酒買一送一，非常划算。幾個小點都非常美味，炸雞翅酥脆好吃，調味不俗，我們之後又追加再點一份；起士火腿拼盤的布里起士，微微烤過，非常加分，火腿弱了一點，但整體還不錯；烤蔬菜純粹是為了增加纖維質，不功不過。由於考量到回家的車程，就不再點酒精類飲料，西西里咖啡是我喝過最好喝的，檸檬和咖啡，各自的風味飽滿，足以抗衡，好喝！

外場服務人員的訓練不錯，對於自家酒類餐點的知識充足，我不會說他們的態度親切，但是有一定的水準！","Originally I just wanted to find a place to chat with friends, the standard of food and drinks was unexpected!

Before seven o'clock, buy one free and red and white wine, which is very cost -effective.A few small dots are very delicious, fried chicken wings are crispy and delicious, and the seasoning is not vulgar. We will add another copy afterwards; the Borri cheese of the cheese ham platter, grilled slightly, very extra points, the ham is a bit weakened, the ham is a bit weakened, the ham is a bit weakened, the ham is a bit weakened. But the overall is not bad; the grilled vegetables are purely to increase fiber, and it is not done.Due to the consideration of going home, I won't order alcoholic beverages. Sicily coffee is the best drink. Lemon and coffee have their respective flavors, enough to compete, delicious!

The training staff in the field is good. I have sufficient knowledge about my own wine meals. I will not say that they have a kind attitude, but there is a certain level!"
"很美氣氛很好的餐廳，服務人員態度很好，三樓有酒吧及露天座位。
不過我們當時坐的那一桌上面沒有燈(其他桌有) 所以其實還蠻暗的。

餐點部分味道很好，巧達濃湯又想又濃，麵包建議泡進湯裡面軟了再吃。
奶油燉飯帶點紅酒香，鴨胸偏有嚼勁。
鮭魚沙拉只有兩個鮭魚，比較可惜，希望能再多一點。
拼盤的部分，那個火腿肉的味道我真的吃不習慣。

總結來說不管是為了食物、裝潢還是氣氛 都很值得去的一家餐廳。","The restaurant with a very beautiful atmosphere, the service staff has a good attitude. There are bars and open -air seats on the third floor.
However, there was no light on the table sitting at the time (other tables), so it was actually quite dark.

The meal part of the meal is very good. Qianda soup is strong and strong. It is recommended to soak in the soup and eat it.
The cream stewed rice has some red wine, and the duck breast is chewy.
Salmon salad has only two salmon, which is a pity, I hope to be more.
In the platter part, I really don't get used to the taste of the ham meat.

In summary, it is a restaurant that is worth going for food, decoration, or atmosphere."

"如叢林般的迷幻空間讓大家無不嘖嘖稱奇，包含我在內也都一直不斷驚呼著:『這也太美了吧!』。很想知道是怎麼樣有品味的團隊可以讓一間餐廳同時兼顧視覺、味覺還有那不可多得的人情味。

Lazy Point菜色內容包山包海，有排餐、義大利麵、燉飯和炸物等等。如果是下午茶時段也有一般咖啡、果汁、法式吐司等選擇。這次點的松露薯條深得我心，酥脆的薯條搭配濃郁到不行的松露，難怪可以榮登店內的招牌。

燉飯的部分選擇了店員推薦搭配美國大干貝的的青醬燉飯，一送上來就讓人忍不住驚呼：『好大的干貝啊!』 送入口中之後每一次咀嚼都是新鮮甘甜。

還有這個征服所有人的戰斧豬排
一開始我們都還在想說：『哇這樣一道將近1000塊的豬排真的會值得嗎？』直到入口的那一刻我投降了!
舌尖上充分的感受到肉質的軟嫩、新鮮，Lazy point 最厲害的就是總能賦予食物恰到好處的調味卻又不搶走食材的原始風味，一旁的芥末醬更是畫龍點睛，我個人真的對這道菜愛不釋手。

那份款待之情是如此顯而易見，你總能真真實實感覺到主人對每一道菜的用心。這次吃完之後已經默默將lazy point 收入口袋名單，下次一定還會再來嘗試更多不同菜色，真心推薦給你們。","The psychedelic space like a jungle made everyone amazing, and I have been exclaiming, including me, ""This is too beautiful!""I really want to know how a tasteful team can make a restaurant taking into account both vision, taste, and that rare human taste.

Lazy Point's dishes include meals, pasta, pasta, stew and fried, and so on.If it is in the afternoon tea period, there are also general coffee, fruit juice, French toast and other choices.The truffle fries this time won my heart. The crispy fries were paired with a strong truffle. No wonder it can be awarded the signboard in the store.

The part of the stewed rice chose the green sauce stewed rice with the American scallops in the United States. As soon as it was delivered, it couldn't help but exclaim: ""What a big scallops!"" After sending it in the mouth Essence

And this Tomahawk pork chop that conquered everyone
At the beginning, we still wondered, ""Wow, will nearly 1,000 pork chops really worth it?I surrendered until the moment I entrance!
The tip of the tongue fully feels the softness and freshness of the meat. The most powerful Lazy Point is that the original flavor of the food that can always give the food exactly without snatching the ingredients. The mustard sauce on the side is the finishing touch. Tao cuisine loves to put it down.

The sentimental sentiment is so obvious that you can always feel the owner's intentions for each dish.After eating this time, I have silently included Lazy Point's pocket list. Next time, I will try more different dishes, and I really recommend it to you."

餐點口味舒服沒有過度調味，用餐環境舒適，可惜桌子不夠穩有晃動的感覺｡,"The taste of the meal is comfortable and not excessively seasoned. The dining environment is comfortable. Unfortunately, the table is not stable and shaking."
環境氣氛不錯，裝潢具時尚設計感，服務人員帥氣親切，地點離港墘捷運站步行三分鐘，是內科附近不錯的放鬆空間。三層樓餐廳與酒品的複合式經營，一樓是櫃台與吧台酒館，二樓餐廳，三樓露天酒吧(可吸菸)，從白天營業到深夜，所以餐點從brunch到late night(22:00)提供的宵夜小點都有，不管是好友聚餐或約會用餐或小酌皆可。燉飯、義大利麵的餐點份量稍微偏少，口味不錯；開胃菜口味稱職，開胃也很下酒；串烤類則表現普普；酒品、調酒尚有一定的水準。價位如內湖區消費一般偏高。,"The environmental atmosphere is good, the decoration is fashionable design, and the service staff is handsome and kind. The location is three minutes walking from Hong Kong 墘 MRT Station. It is a good room for relaxation near the Department of Internal Medicine.The three -storey restaurant and the composite operation of wine products. On the first floor is the counter and bar tavern, the second floor restaurant, the open -air bar on the third floor (smoking), from the day of the day to late at night, so the meal from brunch to Late Night (22: 00) There are small dots provided, whether it is a friend's dinner or dating or drinking.The meal of stewed rice and spasm noodles is slightly less, and the taste is good; appetizing dishes are competent, and appetizers are also very wine; skewers are prefining; wine and bartending still have a certain level.The price is as high as Neihu District."
餐點都在水準之上，不論肉類或海鮮，都有一定品質。特別推薦青醬干貝燉飯、香料烤肉串、脆皮桂丁雞。干貝超大顆又鮮甜，烤肉串肉相當嫩。脆皮桂丁雞的雞肉採友善飼養的雞肉。份量上，男生來說也是相當足夠，用餐環境一如其名，就是要讓人進來能放鬆享受慵懶。頂樓的酒吧，隱密且氣氛好。平均每人消費約500起,"The meals are above the standard, whether it is meat or seafood, it has a certain quality.It is specially recommended that green sauce stewed rice, spice barbecue skewers, crispy cinnamon chicken.The size of the scallops is large and fresh, and the skewers of the barbecue are quite tender.Crispy cinnamon chicken chicken picking chicken raised by friends.In terms of weight, boys are also quite enough. The dining environment is the same as its name, that is, to let people come in to relax and enjoy laziness.The bar on the top floor is hidden and the atmosphere is good.The average consumption per person is about 500 starting from 500"
"路過附近意外發現的好店
食物隨便點每樣都很好吃
尤其手工寬麵的牛舌入口即化真的是讚死！
店內每層樓的氛圍也大不同 非常有趣🤔
下次想要白天來吃早午餐～","Good shops passing by accidentally discovered nearby
It's delicious to order food casually
Especially the entrance of the hand -wide beef tongue is really praise!
The atmosphere of each floor in the store is also very different, very interesting 🤔
I want to come to break breakfast during the day ~"
"餐點真的超好吃！
脆皮桂丁雞、松露卡布奇諾、蟹黃燉飯必點❤️肉質軟嫩皮酥脆！每盤都秒殺🥰甜點也超好吃！
值得再訪😉服務員Lisa超專業
每道菜都暸落指掌

It is worth visiting the waiter Lisa Super Professional
Every dish is fingered

"氣氛和環境都很不錯,餐點也相當好吃,價位在內科園區來說屬於中高,只可惜多人定位時位置很小.用餐起來不是很方便.大家要一起擠在一張中型長桌用餐.服務態度稍嫌不足","The atmosphere and environment are very good, and the meal is also quite delicious. The price is a high high in the internal medicine park. Unfortunately, the position of many people is very small when the positioning of many people. The meal is not very convenient. The service attitude is slightly not enough"
"非常舒適的用餐環境
不愧對名為Lazy Point
很放鬆 餐點也精緻
唯一美中不足是 燈光略暗
以及訂6:00只能吃到7:45
並會重複善意提醒時間
以喝酒來說 時間上會稍感壓力
詢問後 若訂8點就沒有限時問題
下次會選擇8點的場次","Very comfortable dining environment
It is worthy of being named Lazy Point
Very relaxed meal and exquisite
The only lack of beauty is that the light is slightly darker
And ordering 6:00 can only be eaten to 7:45
And will repeat the goodwill reminder time
In terms of drinking, it will feel a little pressure in time
If you ask at 8 o'clock, there is no limited problem
I will choose at 8 o'clock next time"
燉飯不錯，tapas都很有份量大家很好share。晚上超沒人。頂樓露天bar氣氛很好。服務很快也親切。柚子和風醬的沙拉很好吃。,"The stew is good, TAPAS is very good, everyone is very good.No one at night.The open -air bar at the top floor is very good.The service soon and kind.The salads of grapefruit and wind sauce are delicious."
"很喜歡的裝潢跟氛圍
一直都收藏在口袋名單終於去到了
有點傻眼大概是預約8：00但8：36就說最後加點吧
會覺得有點太趕

羊排有過生，不過跟他們反應之後，馬上得到了回應也直接變成招待我們吃羊排了

再來就是有一點貴

不過下次還會再來好好試試調酒類的，再來補充其他的","Favorite decoration and atmosphere
Always collected on the pocket list and finally arrived
A little dumbfounded, about 8:00, but 8:36, just say the final add some, let
Will feel a bit too busy

The lamb chops have been lived, but after responding to them, the response immediately became directly entertaining us to eat lamb chops.

It's a bit expensive again

But next time I will try to adjust the wine again, and then add other parts"
"裝潢很美很有格調
不論外觀或內部
氣氛都超級好的一間餐酒館

可惜今天吃到的食物
覺得只有蟹黃燉飯非常好吃～～
燉飯中搭配毛豆仁 有口感 飯屬於中等
不會太硬 調味很舒服
配上超級無敵酥脆的軟殼蟹
真的是咬下去都有酥酥的ASMR
非常有水準的一道

主餐 豬排的部分 上面有搭配藍紋起司醬
其實也是不錯的
只是肉質偏油 偏軟
所以有幾口吃起來很膩
可能因為又有起司醬的關係
下面有搭配一些蔬菜
都蠻好吃的

松露薯條 普普通通
有點乾有點硬
有一些有油油的感覺

炸雞翅 普普通通
其實炸得不錯
肉醃的很有味道
只是可能不是我喜歡的口味
對我來說醃的味道有點太重

酒的部分 覺得都還不錯喝喔
而且酒單其實非常可愛
是有各個國家地點命名
點了一杯 倫敦 跟一杯 秘魯
都滿清爽的口感 順口
不是很有層次
但還滿適合配食物的唷～～～

另外服務都很用心
會一直來幫忙加水
是一個很適合約會或朋友聚會的餐廳喔！","The decoration is beautiful and stylish
No matter the appearance or internal
The atmosphere is super good.

Unfortunately
I think only crab yellow stewed rice is very delicious ~~
Stewed rice with edamame bean feels like a medium
It won't be too hard to season, very comfortable
With super invincible crispy soft shell crab
I really have a crispy ASMR
Very standard

The main meal pork chop is paired with blue pattern cheese sauce
Actually good
It's just fleshy oil and soft
So there are a few mouthfuls to taste tired
Maybe because there is a cheese sauce,
There are some vegetables below
It's pretty delicious

Tulu French fries are common
A little dry and hard
There are some feeling of oil

Fried chicken wings are common
Actually blew well
The meat is marinated with flavor
It's just that it may not be my favorite taste
The taste of pickling for me is a bit too heavy

The part of the wine feels pretty good to drink
And the wine list is actually very cute
It is named after the location of various countries
Ordered a cup of London and a Cup of Peru
The refreshing taste is smooth
Not very layered
But it is also full of food 合 ~~~

In addition, the service is very attentive
Will always come to help add water
It is a restaurant that is very suitable for dating or friends!"
Lazy Point 雖然處於科學園區周邊，有很多辦公大樓，但風景很棒！餐點也有不少特製的醬料，像是綠女神醬、brunch配的蔓越莓油醋醬 推推👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 …,"Although Lazy Point is around the scientific park, there are many office buildings, but the scenery is great!There are also a lot of special sauces, such as the Green Goddess Sauce and Brunch."
"有趣的店名、店內氛圍相互呼應；
設計師的功力不錯：
充分利用挑高的空間 及大量的裝置擺設家具，讓整體氣氛熱鬧有趣親切，但洗手臺手法略不實用；
使用餐椅舒適 餐桌高度合宜，在沒有時間限制時提供良好的使用經驗。
有餐有酒：
餐多以義大利菜為主，不同時段有不同餐點 早午餐、商業午餐，但味道並無突出表現、份量一般，如不挑剔還算ok，但要求CP值的朋友，可能無法順心，飲品離峰時段還有優惠。
店內音樂有挑選過，舒適不哭鬧，裝置物品多，沒有嘈雜迴音的問題。
服務態度還ok。","The interesting store name and the atmosphere of the store echo each other;
The designer's skill is good:
Make full use of the high space and a large amount of device furniture to make the overall atmosphere lively, interesting and intimidated, but the handwashing method is slightly not practical;
Use dining chairs to comfortable dining tables high, and provide good experience when there is no time limit.
There are meals and wine:
Most of the meals are mainly Italian cuisine. Different meals have different meals for brunch and commercial lunch at different times. There are still discounts from peak hours.
The music in the store has been selected.
The service attitude is OK."
同事介紹的餐酒館因離上班地點近就決定來此慶生，店家貼心送了6杯慶生酒，還遇到有人在此求婚，是一個非常有情調的地方，餐點ok，但調酒cp值就很低，一杯奶酒滿是冰塊...,"The restaurant introduced by colleagues was decided to come here because of near the work place. The store sent 6 cups of birthday wines, and encountered someone to propose here. It is a very emotional place. It's very low, a glass of milk is full of ice ..."
謝謝Lazy point讓我們擁有一個美好的七夕晚餐～餐點很不錯～店內氣氛很棒,Thank you Lazy Point for letting us have a beautiful Tanabata dinner ~ The meal is very good ~ The atmosphere in the shop is great
"聖誕套餐
湯是整個套餐裡最有印象的 很濃很好喝
主餐牛排蠻嫩的 麵也不錯 但都沒有很驚艷
沙拉有點不懂為何要放一整條完整的菜
有點難切
然後提拉米蘇太甜
而且上面有一大塊奶油不喜歡

調酒跟提拉米蘇是另外加購的
整體以CP值來說 不高","Christmas package
The soup is the most impressive in the whole package, very strong and delicious
The main meal steak is very tender noodles, but it is not amazing
The salad is a bit unknown why it is to put a whole complete dish
A bit difficult to cut
Then Tiramisu is sweet
And there is a large piece of cream on it, I don’t like it

The bartending and Tiramisu are purchased separately
The overall CP value is not high"
寵物友善餐廳，可訂位，雞翅好吃，爬樓梯上二樓用餐區，環境整潔舒適，廁所也乾淨，餐盤器皿都富創意拍照起來有氣氛，口味比較沒那麼合胃口。,"Pet friendly restaurants, can be booked, chicken wings are delicious, climb the dining area on the second floor of the stairs, the environment is neat and comfortable, the toilet is also clean, the dining vessels are rich and creative, and the taste is less appetizing."
"道道都可以感受到餐廳的用心
松露湯好驚豔、提拉米蘇超好吃
松露薯條、炸雞翅甜辣口感超棒
氣氛好、服務好、餐點美味
歡迎大家去喔，還有三樓露天的酒吧可以喝酒

"午餐選項不多，以燉飯 / 義大利麵 / 輕食沙拉為主，想吃排餐跟Tapas要晚餐時段來。餐點口味不錯，麵飯都軟硬適中，章魚跟松阪豬份量給的很大方，沙拉柚子醬清爽不膩。
空間採光好，桌數不多但桌距不會太近，商業午餐跟朋友聚會都適合，建議提早訂位。","There are not many lunch options. It is mainly stew / pasta / light food salad. I want to eat dinner and TAPAS for dinner time.The taste of the meal is good, the noodles are soft and hard, the octopus and Matsusaka pig are very generous, and the salad grapefruit sauce is refreshing and not greasy.
The space is good, the table is not large, but the table distance will not be too close. The commercial lunch is suitable for gathering with friends. It is recommended to book a place early."

Lazy Point is located in the lively Duzi Street in Neihu. The three -story single -family hidden in the Department of Internal Medicine. It is adjacent to the MRT Port Station.

Whether it is relaxed from work, a friend's party, and stealing a dating, it is a great choice!The above experience is recommended for everyone for reference ~"
第一次在外面看到它時，覺得內部裝潢很特別，今天造訪真的很別出心裁的裝潢，我們來這是為了下午茶，以為會有別的菜單，但是都一樣，不得不說的是，服務人員真的很不到位，完全沒有要服務的精神，對於第一次來的客人，完全沒有要介紹菜單或說明，就沒事般的站在櫃檯，也不解釋東西位置在哪等，今天點白蘭地拿鐵和巧克力蛋糕，說實在的還不錯，但是這樣的服務品質，應該是不會再次造訪。,"When I saw it outside for the first time, I felt that the interior decoration was very special. Today's visits are really ingeniously decorated. We came here for afternoon tea and thought there would be other menus, but they were all the same. The service staff is really not in place, and there is no spirit of service at all. For the first guests, there is no to introduce the menu or instructions at all. Bailan Di Latte and Chocolate Cake are really good, but the quality of such service should not be visited again."
"推薦 午後的貝魯特紅茶，喜歡威士忌的朋友可以點點看，堅果加芝麻的香氣很迷人
餐點表現中規中矩，環境相當舒適，三樓還有露天Bar","Recommended Berurt black tea in the afternoon. Friends who like whiskey can see it. The aroma of nuts and sesame is very charming.
The performance of the meal is quite satisfactory, the environment is quite comfortable, and there are open -air BAR on the third floor"

餐點還不錯，吃起來挺美味的。中午點了商業午餐+付費套餐，份量偏少且價位有點高....有點美中不足,"The meal is pretty good, and it tastes delicious.At noon, I ordered a commercial lunch+paid package. The portion is small and the price is a bit high ...."
非常舒服的一個地方，坐立在商業大樓地段裡的獨棟餐酒館，空間非常寬敞，一樓主要是櫃檯、廚房與窗邊吧台座位，二樓是用餐區，三樓是空中酒吧，餐點平均每道價格約$400左右，選擇性也滿多，以食材用料和價錢來說，我認為完全成正比，CP值頗高，當天我們點的是桂丁雞、香料烤肉串、炭烤凱薩沙拉、水果茶、桂花奶茶，都完全無雷，可以看出他們對食材的堅持及用心~,"A very comfortable place, sitting in a single -family dining tavern standing in the business building area. The space is very spacious. The first floor is the seats on the counter, the kitchen and the window side of the window. The price is about $ 400 per channel, and the selectivity is also full.

松露薯條🍟 🎯必點🎯
很好吃！炸的金黃酥脆的薯條，佐上松露，帶著濃濃的松露香味，非常適合搭配著酒類飲料～

松露義大利麵🍝
濃濃松露香氣配上起司還帶點香菇的香氣，香菇和松露的味道搭配的恰到好處，不過份量比較小一點，比較適合女生的份量喔！

Mojito🍹 🎯必點🎯
當初就是為了這杯來到這裡的，果然沒有令人失望，是一杯外觀非常搶眼、本身也很好喝的調酒呢～～杯子外還有結霜的冰塊，好喝🙌🏼 來到這邊，不知道要點什麼調酒的朋友，點這個就沒錯了，濃濃的薄荷味喝起來非常爽口呢！","The space is beautiful and the atmosphere is also very good. It is suitable for sisters to meet or date. The meals are delicious and the wine is very delicious ~

Tulu French fries 🎯 🎯 🎯 must be ordered
Very delicious!The fried golden and crispy fries, with a truffle, with a strong truffle flavor, is very suitable for wine drinks ~

Tulu Italian Noodles 义
The thick truffle aroma is matched with the aroma of shiitake mushrooms. The taste of shiitake mushrooms and truffles is just right, but the portion is relatively small, which is more suitable for girls!

Mojito🎯 🎯 must order 🎯
It was for this cup to come here. It really was not disappointing. It was a cup that was very eye -catching and delicious. There were frosty ice cubes outside the cup. By the way, I do n’t know what to order bartender, just order this right. The thick mint taste is very refreshing!"

濃好吃～","On the second floor is a dining tavern, the top floor is outdoor bar, and it will be intimate with rain sheds.There are many types of bartending, and the flavor of French fries and truffles

氣氛不錯，餐點中等，服務人員人手不太夠，二樓用餐區只有一位，故比較無法即時處理簡單的服務，建議尖峰時間再多請一位,"The atmosphere is good, the meal is medium, and the service staff is not very hand. There is only one dining area on the second floor."
食物表現大多都在水準之上，算是非常好吃；唯獨份量不多，同行的男性友人們吃完後大部分都沒有吃飽😂 松露薯條松露味超足夠超香必須給推～ 酒的份量以價位來說算偏少，價位也偏高一些，食物的表現大勝過於酒。裝潢很漂亮，位置不多但很舒適，頂樓有露天的bar可以小酌～ …,"Most of the food performance is above the standard, which is very delicious; the only amount is not large, and most of the male friends who peers have not eaten it after eating. In terms of price, the amount is too small, the price is higher, and the performance of food is much better than alcohol.The decoration is very beautiful, the location is not many but very comfortable. There are open -air BAR on the top floor to drink ~ ..."
"戰斧豬沒熟一切開都是血，法式小羔羊真的就是‘‘法式’’，餐點非常的‘‘精緻’’，九百八的價錢建議還是去法式餐廳點比較好，食物cp值最高的就是烤雞，好吃鮮美。
另外，座位安排太近了，幾乎已經貼著隔壁桌在吃飯，好擠呀。","Tomahawk is not familiar with all blood. French lamb is really '' French ''. The meal is very '' 'delicate' '. The highest is the grilled chicken, which is delicious.
In addition, the seat arrangement is too close, and it is almost stuck in the next table to eat, so crowded."
餐點味道很好，可惜份量偏少，所以感覺價格較高。,"The meal tastes very good, but unfortunately the portion is small, so it feels higher."
"又美又好吃欸，美式早午餐推推
白天光超充足好拍
晚上應該也讚讚","Beautiful and delicious, American -style lunch push

燉飯口感很棒，燻鮭魚味道口感不錯。這次點新品燻鴨燉飯，燻鴨很難切，口感也乾柴，味道也很普通，下次不會點燻鴨了。朋友點義大利麵說份量太少，兩口就吃完😂😂 …,"Stew rice taste is great, and the smoked salmon tastes good.This time, a new product smoked duck stewed rice, the smoked duck is difficult to cut, the taste is also dry, the taste is very ordinary, and the smoked duck will be ordered next time.Friends order the pasta and say that the portion is too small, and the two are eaten ..."

很特別的一家義式料理為主的餐廳，咖啡店，和晚上有露天酒吧的三層樓獨棟建築。這在整個內湖科技園區內，都是現代化大型高樓建築之中，很特別的。,"A special restaurant, coffee shops, and three -storey unique buildings with open -air bar at night.In the entire Neihu Science and Technology Park, it is among modern large -scale high -rise buildings, which is very special."

服務態度佳，二樓用餐氣氛尚可，三樓戶外酒吧氣氛較佳；蟹黃燉飯口味稍重，但軟殼蟹達標，蛤蜊清炒義大利麵順口。調酒類皆是店家特調，很推！,"The service attitude is good. The atmosphere of the dining on the second floor is okay. The atmosphere of the outdoor bar on the third floor is better; the crab yellow stewed rice has a slightly heavy taste, but the soft shell crab meets the standard.Blooming is specially tuned in the store, and it is very pushing!"
"餐點、蛋糕、氣氛都很棒
每人均消未超過1,000元會限制時間，入場前會事先講，所以當被請離開時還能理解。
但打85折的松露薯條、炸通心粉與買一送一的啤酒，被折扣的部分仍被算入服務費，感覺真的很差，不會來第二次了。","Meals, cakes, and atmosphere are great
Each person does not exceed 1,000 yuan to limit the time, and will talk about it before entering, so you can understand it when you are invited to leave.
However, the 20 % off truffle fans, fried heart powder, and buying one free beer, the discount part is still calculated into the service fee, it feels really bad, it will not come for the second time."

"少數在內湖的餐酒館，食物好吃、價格尚可，是個可以跟三五好友聚餐的地方！我的主食點了一份清炒白酒義大利麵，內含非常多的蛤蠣，醬汁主要有橄欖油為基底，麵條也比較不太一樣，是偏扁一點的麵體，整體而言份量還算可以，並且是好吃的～

另外我非常大力推薦的則是這家的松露薯條，好吃到我一直不停的說出「真的好好吃喔！」。雖然松露薯條的份量比較少一些，但是薯條上會撒足夠的松露，調味也弄的很好吃，完全不需要額外沾醬就可以一口接著一口，結帳時松露薯條還打85折，讓我非常想要來這間點很多份松露薯條！壽星的話可以來這裡慶生，它也會提供免費的shot。整體而言，算是在內湖還算不錯的餐酒館～

松露薯條：忘記拍照了，薯條本體表現平平，但配合松露醬一起吃卻驚為天人。松露濕軟且濃郁的口感拯救了薯條偏硬(不是脆）的口感，沒吃過的仍推薦一試","The price is slightly higher, but the value is worth it

位於三樓的室外是享用醇厚雞尾酒的好地方。  比爾調製優質飲料。  第一次嘗試青黴素，我就上癮了。  我們會回來喝更多飲料，看看食物是否一樣好。  絕對是周六晚上輕鬆享用雞尾酒的五星級場所。,The outdoor on the third floor is a good place to enjoy mellow cocktails.Bill modulates high -quality drinks.I was addicted for the first time I tried penicillin.We will come back to drink more drinks and see if the food is as good.It is definitely a five -star venue that can easily enjoy cocktails on Saturday night.
自從我搬回台灣後，我就想嘗試這個地方。  但我前兩次嘗試參觀時都被訂滿了。  最後，我們在工作日下午找到了一張桌子來吃晚午餐。  但這個地方一點也不讓我失望。  首先，我對才華洋溢的年輕廚師表示讚賞。  他們的烹飪技巧和創造力從一開始就贏得了我的完全尊重。  冷盤搭配蜂蜜烤布里乾酪的選擇真是巧妙。  我們吃的所有融合菜都做得很完美。  我們真的很享受這次體驗！,"Since I moved back to Taiwan, I wanted to try this place.But I was full when I tried to visit the first two times.In the end, we found a table on the afternoon of our working day to have a night lunch.But this place will not disappoint me at all.First of all, I praised the talented young chefs.Their cooking skills and creativity have won my complete respect from the beginning.The choice of cold dishes with honey roasted cloth cheese is really clever.All the fusion dishes we eat are perfect.We really enjoy this experience!"
氣氛獨特，對食物的詮釋也獨特。是不是有一種大自然緩慢的感覺？義大利麵和松露薯條非常美味。他們說義大利麵上面的肉是舌頭^^;;  我也很喜歡炸魚和炸雞。這是我在台灣去過的最獨特概念的餐廳。而且石碗也不錯。我一聽，心情很沉重。,"The atmosphere is unique and the interpretation of food is also unique.Does it have a slow feeling of nature?Italian noodles and truffle potato strips are very delicious.They said that the meat on the Italian noodles is the tongue ^^;;; I also like fried fish and fried chicken.This is the most unique concept I have been in Taiwan.And the stone bowl is also good.As soon as I heard it, I was in a heavy mood."

下午 5:30-7:30 提供選酒一對一服務。服務生提供了一本像故事書一樣的手繪雞尾酒指南，介紹了雞尾酒的背景/起源、所用烈酒的種類、以及每款雞尾酒的味道，內容非常豐富。
屋頂是一個相當浪漫的地方，但我不會出來看看，因為對我來說太冷了。夏天一定會再來。","I came here to drink with an old friend.It was a cold day.This restaurant is very generous and humane. When I arrived, they had a seat before they opened the door.

The roof is a very romantic place, but I won't come out to see, because it is too cold for me.Summer will definitely come again."
我們去懶點吃晚餐。二樓是室內用餐區，三樓是室外酒吧。我們點的飯菜在各方面都滿足了我們的期望。雞翅和松露薯條都是一流的。他們的紐約牛排非常棒。它味道鮮美，非常美味。該機構唯一需要改進的地方是服務。我會再回來品嚐他們的其他飲料和雞尾酒！,"Let's go lazy to have dinner.The second floor is an indoor dining area, and the third floor is an outdoor bar.The meals we ordered met our expectations in all aspects.Both chicken wings and truffles are first -class.Their New York steak is great.It tastes delicious and very delicious.The only place to improve the agency is the service.I will come back to taste their other beverages and cocktails!"
懶點確實營造了一種舒適的感覺，無論桌子還是椅子。它不僅僅是一家餐廳，還出售一些盤子和其他小東西。不管怎樣，菜色夠好，值得一試。如果您喜歡西餐，我建議您來這裡。明亮的地方，輕鬆的心情。,"Lazy really creates a comfortable feeling, whether the table or a chair.It is not only a restaurant, but also sells some plates and other small things.Anyway, the dishes are good enough to try.If you like Western food, I suggest you come here.A bright place, a relaxed mood."

西湖/港前捷運附近的一個出色的地方..氣氛很好~二樓是一個室內場所，可以看到建築物的景色。三樓是露天酒吧。份量不算大，擺盤漂亮，味道不錯🥩😍✨ …,"An excellent place near the MRT of the West Lake/Hong Kong. The atmosphere is very good ~ The second floor is a indoor place, and the scenery of the building can be seen.The third floor is an open -air bar.The portion is not large, the plate is beautiful, the taste is good ..."
食物很好，氣氛很好，還有一個很棒的屋頂酒吧。我一定會回去。,"The food is very good, the atmosphere is very good, and there is a great roof bar.I will definitely go back."
"好好吃，推推
玉米好甜","Be well, push push
Corn is so sweet"
食物不錯，但量很少。一定需要點開胃菜，但那樣會很貴。,"The food is good, but the amount is very small.You must order appetizers, but that's so expensive."
從大樓外面看就愛上了，氣氛很棒。價格合理，食物和雞尾酒都很棒！我們在二樓吃了晚飯，然後搬到三樓喝雞尾酒，這是一個戶外酒吧，晚上很浪漫。,"I fell in love with the outside of the building, and the atmosphere was great.The price is reasonable, food and cocktails are great!We had dinner on the second floor, and then moved to the third floor to drink cocktails. This is an outdoor bar, which is very romantic at night."
非常舒適和熱情，提供優質的客製化服務。食物的味道也很好，絕對會推薦。,"Very comfortable and enthusiastic, provide high -quality customized services.The taste of food is also very good, and it will definitely recommend it."
這家酒吧/餐廳真的很酷。屋頂區域非常好。遺憾的是這項服務沒有達到應有的水準。我們有8個人，每人點了一杯飲料。我們所有人都花了 40 多分鐘才拿到飲料。這個地方甚至沒有擠滿人。那時距離關門只剩下一個小時了。我們訂購後，他們回來了 3 次告訴我們其中一種飲料沒有了。我的意思是，你可以從一開始就告訴我們哪些飲料沒了，而不是來回 3 次。這根本就不專業。我希望他們能夠改進這一點，因為這個地方確實值得變得更好。,"This bar/restaurant is really cool.The roof area is very good.Unfortunately, this service did not reach the level of due.We have 8 people, each ordered a drink.It took more than 40 minutes to get the drink.This place is not even crowded.At that time, it was only an hour left.After we ordered, they returned three times and told us that one of them was gone.I mean, you can tell us which drinks are gone from the beginning, not 3 times back and forth.This is not professional at all.I hope they can improve this, because this place is indeed better."
優質的食品和飲料！來這裡與我們的客戶共進午餐，每個人都很享受。然而，服務需要一些改進……女服務員似乎有點慢而且缺乏信心。,"High -quality food and drinks!Come here to have lunch with our customers, everyone enjoys it.However, the service requires some improvements ... The female waiters seem a bit slow and lack of confidence."
食物太棒了！音樂很好聽。可愛的人和裝飾。,The food is great!The music is nice.Cute people and decorations.
"是一次非常高級的體驗。
是約會的最佳場所，是享受美食和美酒的最佳場所。是。一定要第一時間預約","It is a very advanced experience.
It is the best place for dating and the best place to enjoy food and wine.yes.Must make an appointment as soon as possible"
非常喜歡這裡的食物，儘管與一般的早午餐/咖啡館相比，它相當昂貴。,"I like the food here very much, although it is quite expensive compared to ordinary lunch/cafe."
美味的雞尾酒，僻靜的地點，特殊的裝飾，食物還可以。,"Delicious cocktails, secluded places, special decorations, and food."
"非常寬敞的餐廳和酒吧，適合朋友聚會或休閒約會。

乾淨，裝潢精美，價格合理，味道鮮美。

將來肯定會與更大的團體再次訪問並在這裡吃一頓全餐。","Very spacious restaurants and bars, suitable for friends to meet or leisure.

Clean, exquisite decoration, reasonable price, delicious taste.

In the future, I will definitely visit with greater groups and eat a meal here."
工作日下午可能會非常放鬆。食物、服務和環境還可以接受,"It may be very relaxed on the afternoon of working on the working day.Food, service and environment are acceptable"
"雞尾酒和食物還可以，但就其本身和地方而言非常昂貴（屋頂看不到風景，缺少 10 層樓）。
需要預約但露台空著？","Cocktails and foods are okay, but it is very expensive as it and places (the landscape cannot be seen on the roof, and there is a lack of 10 floors).
Need to make an appointment, but the terrace is empty?"
週日來這裡吃晚午餐。食物創新又美味。氣氛很好。,Come here for a evening lunch on Sunday.Food is innovative and delicious.The atmosphere is very good.
是個約會喝酒的好地方。它並不太貴，買不起。,It's a good place to drink.It is not too expensive and can't afford it.
有點貴但是食物品質很好！,"It's a bit expensive, but the quality of food is very good!"
"懶點很美。食物很棒！我和我的妻子很喜歡這裡的雞翅和起司拼盤。調酒師調製優質飲品。
這裡的服務真的很好。火星在兩個不同的場合照顧了我們並成功了。他提出了很好的飲料建議，並且總是在那裡補充水和清理盤子。我和我的妻子非常欣賞這裡的服務品質。我們期待著回來，並希望火星在那裡迎接我們。如果您重視美麗的餐廳和酒吧、美味的食物和優質的服務，我強烈推薦 Lazy Point！","Lazy is beautiful.The food is great!My wife and I like the chicken wings and cheese platter here very much.Make a bartender to prepare high -quality drinks.
The service here is really good.Mars took care of us on two different occasions and succeeded.He put forward good drinks and always replenished water and cleaning the plate there.My wife and I appreciate the quality of service here very much.We look forward to returning and hope that Mars will welcome us there.If you value beautiful restaurants and bars, delicious food and high -quality services, I strongly recommend Lazy Point!"
「寒意」的體現。一個閒逛和吃一些冷飲的好地方。很適合聊天，1+1 歡樂時光很有幫助。,"The embodiment of ""chill"".A good place to wander and eat cold drinks.It is very suitable for chatting, 1+1 happy time is very helpful."
內湖的一個很棒的吃晚餐或特別是喝飲料的地方。坐在屋頂上享用雞尾酒或葡萄酒，放鬆身心，度過該地區涼爽的夜晚，是一件非常愉快的事情。裡面的座位也非常好，現代又時尚。食物很棒，而且相對於你收到的品質來說，價格也不算太差。如果您正在尋找約會的地方或與朋友或同事一起出去玩，那麼這裡就是您的好地方！,"A great dinner in Neihu or a place for drinking.Sitting on the roof to enjoy cocktails or wines, relax the body and mind, and spend the cool night in the area, it is a very pleasant thing.The seats inside are also very good, modern and fashionable.The food is great, and the price is not too bad compared to the quality you received.If you are looking for a place to date or go out with friends or colleagues, then this is your good place!"
"嗯，沒關係。真的不值食物的價格。食物還不錯，沒什麼好寫的。 2瓶啤酒、2份薯條、一份沙拉、一份油炸食品，花了約1,300新台幣。服務員很好。裡面的裝飾還可以。聳聳肩。不會回來。","Well, it's okay.It's really not worth the price of food.The food is not bad, there is nothing to write.Two bottles of beer, 2 parts of fries, a salad, and a fried food, which cost about 1,300 NT $ 1,300.The waiter is very good.The decoration inside is okay.Show up.Will not come back."
喜歡這裡。 Lazy Point 是一家完美的時尚酒吧，擁有平靜的都市氛圍，就像您在舊金山金融區所看到的那樣。流暢的 DJ 聲音和別緻的裝飾使其成為漫長一天後與同事見面的好地方。招牌酒非常棒，今天歡樂時光買一送一。我吃了鵝肝布魯切塔，它是奶油狀的，裡面有鵝肝樣品，放在柔軟的奶油蛋捲式吐司上，配上醃洋蔥、芝麻菜和一點陳年香醋。絕對好吃！,"Like here.Lazy Point is a perfect fashion bar, with a calm urban atmosphere, as you see in the San Francisco Financial District.The smooth DJ sound and unique decoration make it a good place to meet colleagues after a long day.The signature wine is great, buy one get one free in joy today.I ate the foie gras, Bruceta, which is creamy, with foie gras, and placed on a soft creamy egg roll toast with pickled onions, sesame vegetables and a little old vinegar.Absolutely delicious!"
美味的食物和良好的服務！環境也不錯！,Delicious food and good services!The environment is also good!
"燈光美氣氛佳，松露薯條好吃。

這次消費目的是替心儀對象慶生加告白，由於對方喜歡驚喜，預先準備了蛋糕想寄放在店裡，當時是下午時段，接洽的男店員很親切，也相當專業的介紹樓層差異、消費方式用餐時間等等，訂完位後我開心的離開，相當期待攜伴返店用餐；到了晚上，我帶著心儀對象來到店裡，櫃檯沒人接待，四處張望下，發現一位女員工在廚房跟其他人嬉笑打鬧，完全沒有註意到客人上門，待她注意到我們並確認完訂位後。

「你們有寄放蛋糕對嗎？」

無言。

「哈哈哈你不知道他有準備！快忘記快忘記！」

她發現女伴疑惑的眼神，忙著打圓場。

當晚整個食慾都沒了，只點了盤薯條跟調酒，後續沒有任何人來跟我說聲不好意思，真的讓我心底沒有一點peace。
-
事後想想，要製造驚喜，消費者必須跟店家強調要保密，若店家願意協助，則布達予當日所有上班同仁，以免發生憾。

至於告白順利與否，本來想給三星但給了四星評價，那你懂我意思了。","The lights are beautiful, and truffle potatoes are delicious.

The purpose of this consumption is to confess to celebrating the birthday of the heartfelt. Because the other party likes surprises, the cake is prepared in advance to be stored in the store. At that time, it was in the afternoon. Time and so on. After the position was completed, I left happily, looking forward to returning to the store for dining; at night, I came to the store with my favorite object. No one was receiving the counter. Looking around, I found that a female employee was in the kitchen Laughing and troubled by others, she did not notice that the guests came to the door. After she noticed that we and confirmed the reservation.

""Do you have a cake, right?""

Speechless.

""Hahaha, you don’t know he is ready! Forgot to forget!""

She found her doubtful eyes and was busy playing the round field.

That night, the whole appetite was gone, and I only ordered the pancreatic strips and bartending. No one came to say to me afterwards. I really didn't have a little Peace in my heart.
-
Afterwards, if you want to create surprises, consumers must emphasize confidentiality with the store. If the shopkeeper is willing to assist, Buda will give all colleagues on the same day to avoid regrets.

As for whether the confession is smooth or not, I originally wanted to give Samsung but give the four -star evaluation, then you understand what I mean."
這裡的食物和氣氛都很好,The food and atmosphere here are very good
屋頂酒吧的氛圍完美無瑕。它不是 5/5 的唯一原因是因為位置真的很偏僻。,The atmosphere of the roof bar is flawless.It is not the only reason for 5/5 is because the location is really remote.
美味的食物和聊天的好地方。,A good place for delicious food and chat.
內湖最好的酒吧。我喜歡每周和我的朋友在這裡聚會。他們為我們帶來最好的服務和最好的雞尾酒。我關心的一點是夏天是否太熱而不能長時間停留。無論如何，這肯定是尼布爾最好的酒吧。,"The best bar in Neihu.I like to meet with my friends every week.They bring us the best services and the best cocktails.I care about whether it is too hot in summer but not staying for a long time.In any case, this must be the best bar in Nebul."
我對這個地方有一些期望...沒辦法..換了三張桌子，第一次是因為Weiter要求，第二次是因為給了一張在角落裡的桌子，非常熱，我要求將空調設定得涼爽一點，但沒有任何反應，所以我又自己換了一張桌子。開胃菜來了，冷盤和芝士，沒什麼特別的，這種開胃菜在台北隨處可見，尤其是酒店，便宜的煙熏芝士，澳大利亞或美國的薩拉米，點點，意式煙熏火腿，三塊麗茲餅乾和一毫克蜂蜜，假的，我點了麵包，有點晚了，但是意大利麵在麵包之前就到了，開胃菜還在那裡，服務沒有要求任何東西，只是把盤子扔在桌子上，不關心空間或任何東西......我的意思是夥計們，你們假裝是一家有點時髦的現代概念餐廳，但你們對熱情好客和服務一無所知。台北所有咖啡店的義大利麵味道都像義大利麵，可能是文化的關係吧，不過煮義大利麵時火要小一點，否則會聞到燒油的味道，酒也需要在菜單上描述義大利麵是否有辣椒，否則我們怎麼知道???  我的女朋友想要義大利調味飯，但沒有吃，出於中意，但我們發現了自己。一顆星否則無法寫評論！,"I have some expectations for this place ... There is no way .. I changed three tables. The first time was because of Weiter's request. The second time was given a table in the corner. It was very hot. I asked the air conditioner The settings were a bit cool, but there was no response, so I changed my own table by myself.The appetizers are here, cold dishes and cheese, there is nothing special. This appetizer can be seen everywhere in Taipei, especially hotels, cheap smoke cheese, Australia or Sarami in the United States, a little bit, Italian smoky ham, three pieces of three pieces Liz biscuits and a milligram of honey, fake, I ordered the bread, a bit late, but the Italian noodles arrived before the bread. The appetizer was still there. Care about space or anything ... I mean guys, you pretend to be a fashionable modern concept restaurant, but you know nothing about enthusiastic hospitality and services.The taste of the pasta of all coffee shops in Taipei is like a pasta, which may be a cultural relationship, but the fire should be smaller when cooking the pasta, otherwise it will smell the smell of oil. Whether there are peppers on the big faces, otherwise how do we know ??? My girlfriend wants Italian seasonings, but does not eat it, out of the meaning, but we found ourselves.One star cannot write comments!"
都很好吃,They are all delicious
我們過去每周至少來 Lazy Point 3 次。  當一個名叫火星的人在那裡工作時，服務非常好，很好。  最近他們的服務很糟糕，今天我們想走進去，但前台的女士告訴我們已經滿了，而且態度很糟糕。  太糟糕了。  我們很可能會停止去，因為服務和態度太糟糕了,"We have come to Lazy Point 3 times a week in the past.When a person named Mars works there, the service is very good and good.Recently, their services are bad. Today we want to walk in, but the lady at the front desk tells us that it is full and the attitude is bad.It's so bad.We are likely to stop, because the service and attitude are too bad"
不錯的食物，現代的裝飾,"Good food, modern decoration"
服務極差:(我們是兩個人，每人點了一道菜，但在我們收到第一道菜和第二道菜之間不得不等待令人難以置信的時間。同時我們可以看到所有其他桌子都在上菜。,"The service is very poor: (We are two people, each ordered a dish, but we have to wait for the incredible time when we receive the first dish and the second dish. At the same time, we can see all others The tables are all serving."

一個時尚而豪華的地方，有很多漂亮的人。一個享受夜晚的舒適場所,There are many beautiful people in a fashionable and luxurious place.A comfortable place to enjoy night

台北當地酒吧。不錯的雞尾酒。春天的時候，上層露台非常宜人。但夏天可能會很熱。,"Local bar in Taipei.Good cocktail.In spring, the upper terrace is very pleasant.But summer may be hot."
薯條真的很好吃！雖然上菜速度很快，但確實不太好，味道不好，有些飲料太甜了。,"French fries are really delicious!Although the food is fast, it is really not good, the taste is not good, and some drinks are too sweet."
內湖為數不多的深夜選擇之一。相當不錯。屋頂酒吧在夏季特別好。,Neihu is one of the few late -night choices.Quite good.The roof bar is particularly good in summer.
TT的服務很棒。我去過那裡好幾次了。環境不錯，食物…直到這次，我已經等不及下次再去Lazy point了，因為TT的熱情好客。,"TT's service is great.I have been there several times there.The environment is good, the food ... until this time, I can't wait to go to Lazy Point next time, because TT's enthusiastic hospitality."
與價格相比，食物很差。,"Compared with the price, food is poor."
很高興在內湖有更多這種私人的、可愛的下班後去的地方，當你不太餓並且想要一些輕鬆的氛圍和良好的服務時。,"I am glad that there are more personal and lovely places to go after get off work in Neihu, when you are not hungry and want some relaxed atmosphere and good services."

"食物還可以，但是服務很差，女服務員的態度和服務真的很差。
