"bartender本身shake的技術不予置評，但靠著科技與狠活，確實有做出不錯的茶酒，店員推薦第一杯果花味道是有點奇特，不驚艷也沒有很喜歡但還喝得完，第二杯我就非常喜歡了，花草，風味非常豐富
食物方面我很喜歡那個燉飯，偏貴但很好吃，但鴨胸不怎麼樣，把皮跟肉分離不會增加口感，少了中間的油脂反而肉會變柴
服務態度非常好，也可以感受到很在乎客人的體驗，時時詢問我們覺得如何
整體體驗是很不錯的，可以去嘗試看看","Bartender's Shake's technology is not commented, but relying on technology and hard work, there are really good tea wines. The clerk recommends that the first glass of fruit flowers is a bit strange. , I like the second cup very much, flowers and plants, the flavor is very rich

"非常推薦這邊的酒
真的每一個都很好喝！
他們可以把每一個酒都做得跟沒酒感一樣
這邊環境也非常得好
很適合跟朋友來聊天聚餐
唯一可以加強的是服務
因為服務生大部分都很忙，也有可能服務生不夠
所以很常點菜或酒都要等很久
他們才會注意到你

#最推薦的是酒：花木
有很濃的椰果味和牛奶味
喝起來甜甜的但完全不會膩膩
非常的清爽

#起司盤
起司盤上有很多不同種的起司跟肉
也有一點水果和三塊麵包
很適合搭配酒一起吃
一盤還蠻大的適合跟3-4人分
兩人也是可以，但是吃到最後可能會有一點點膩
這個要9:30之後才會供應

#雞肉捲
雞肉捲跟外面做的不太一樣
可以試試看
非常的嫩完全不會乾
配上他們的自製醬非常的棒

#Beyond meat沙拉也蠻好吃的
這個是素食肉
我們不吃素，但是這個吃起來非常的讚
非常適合墊墊胃

#雞翅
就不推薦點
其實不是你所想像的
裡面幾乎沒有肌肉
外面的皮也非常的厚

同行友人其實已經表達出不滿，服務人員也僅是客氣解釋，沒有要重新出餐的意思，儘管送了一杯小調酒、提出送甜點提議，折價200元左右，但我想表達的是，我們作為消費者只是想吃到符合期待的餐點，尤其在生日這天，而不是被以其他小東西打發。","The meal is delicious, exquisitely bartender, distinctive, and service personnel is also serious and polite.

單人套餐：
（冷前菜）海膽巴伐露、海螺、石蓴、克萊門橘
（熱前菜，二選一）雞蛋豆腐、生食干貝、鮭魚卵、洋蔥、發酵辣椒
（主菜，三選一）蝦湯燉飯、澳洲 Westholme 和牛、刺蔥、蛋酥
（甜點）海膽玉子燒、檀木、接骨木、羽衣甘藍、焦糖魚鱗

造訪前在 IG 存下很多酒圖，到現場才曉得多都是季節限定，感覺起來就是酒單會時常更新的一家店。

對於酒類不是很了解的我，原想依圖盲點這條路是行不通的。也增加詢問上的困難，先後兩次詢問對其中一位服務人員的細心介紹，印象深刻，對於新手來說是更加友善。

酒單設計是以 Pantone 顏色做為發想,使用五種自然的元素分別是草花果木陳，
含意是發芽、開花、結果、長成樹木，其中陳是比較抽象的是需要時間的淬鍊，
前面五種元素融合再一起則是大自然的循環，是以兩個元素結合成一杯調酒，
草花與花草雖然名字元素結構相同，但風味完全不同，第一個元素是最主要的風味。

茶酒酒感低、甜度高
經典淬鍊系列，則是大家喜歡的商品，每次換酒單時都會將其保留下來。

慕斯的口感以及奶類的滑順，海膽打入了巴伐露中，雖然看不到海膽本人，但依然能品嘗到它的味道
海螺則是切成片狀，搭配旁邊的海藻以及克萊門橘，柑橘類細緻。

雞蛋豆腐是從鐵板豆腐做發想，將蝦將碩行後去做個半奸詐，咬下去會有爆汁感，
特殊的是上方的白色粉末，原本是油脂，但透過分子料理的轉化搭配會有一些堅果、蔥與胡椒的香氣。

除了大廚、酒師的技術，接待客人的第一線人員尤其重要，
層層堆疊可以讓人感受到餐廳滿滿心意，也能將訊息傳達給客人。","Visiting Date: 2023/12/28
Consumption project: Wild Sakura, Wenshan Bags, Fruit Wood and Single Package
Number of meals: 3 people
Total consumption: $ 4741

(Cold before) sea urchin Bargalus, conch, Shijia, Clemen orange
(Reflected vegetables, one of the two) Egg tofu, raw shellfish, salmon eggs, onions, fermented peppers
(Main cuisine, choose one three) Shrimp soup stew, Australia Westholme and beef, stabbing green onion, egg crispy
(Dessert) sea urchin Yuzi roast, sandalwood, bone wood, cabbage cabbage, caramel fish scales

Before the visit, I kept a lot of wine pictures in IG. Only when I arrived at the scene, I knew that there were many seasonal limits. It felt like a shop where the wine list was often updated.

I do n’t know much about alcohol. I wanted to follow the blind spot of the picture.It also increases the difficulties in inquiry. Two times inquiring about the careful introduction of one of the service staff, it is impressive, which is more friendly to novices.

The design of the wine list is based on the colors of the Pantone. The five natural elements are grass, flowers and wood, respectively.
The meaning is germination, flowering, results, and growing into trees. Among them, Chen is more abstract.
The fusion of the previous five elements is the cycle of nature. It is combined with two elements into a cup of bartender.
Although grass flowers and flowers and plants have the same name elements, the flavor is completely different. The first element is the most important flavor.

Low tea wine, high sweetness
The classic quenching series is the product that everyone likes, and it will keep it when changing the wine list.

Mousse's taste and milk smoothness, sea urchins have been entered into Bavaro. Although they can't see the sea urchin himself, they can still taste its taste
Conch is cut into slices, paired with the seaweed and Clemen oranges, and the citrus is delicate.

Egg tofu is made from iron plate tofu, and the shrimp will be used to make a semi -scam.
Special is the white powder above, which was originally oil, but the conversion of molecular dishes will have some nuts, shallots and pepper aromas.

"今年年初來過一次，但只訂到了宵夜。當時宵夜的每道小菜都非常令人滿意，所以想一定要來吃晚餐菜單。

今天遇到耶誕特別菜單，沒想到主菜「熟成生食鮭魚」讓人大失所望。在前菜已經有炸物「油封鬼頭刀」的情況下，這道主菜完全沒有註明「剝皮辣椒」跟「時蔬」是炸物。也就是說，客人無法事先避免同時點兩道炸物的狀況。我就遇到這種情況，以至於看到端上來的主菜半盤是炸物時有點傻眼，因為相當於點的總共三盤菜當中一多半是油炸食品。如此熱愛炸物，讓我不得不懷疑主廚是否炸天婦羅出身。

除去炸物「驚喜」，這道鮭魚不論是擺盤還是口味都相當普通（參見附圖）。這盤菜為何能收NT$1080讓我相當不解。整體感覺是也許這家店已經名聲在外，所以店家對細節把握已經不再用心。如果不是調酒還OK，我可能會給1星。以後應該不會再來了。

Utterly disappointed by the main dish from the Christmas menu. All the veggies from the main dish “aging salmon” were fried veggies, but it was not indicated on the menu. Having had a fried appetizer before that, this was too much. Besides, neither the taste nor the presentation of the salmon dish lived up to the fame of the restaurant. Definitely not worth the price tag. Would have given a 1 star if it’s not for the drinks. Will not come back.","It came once this year, but it was only booked for supper.At that time, each side dish was very satisfactory, so I wanted to come to dinner menu.

I met the Christmas special menu today. I did not expect that the main cuisine ""cooked raw salmon"" was disappointing.In the absence of the fried ""oil sealing ghost knife"" in the past, the main dish did not indicate that ""peeling peppers"" and ""current vegetables"" were fried.In other words, guests cannot avoid ordering two fried objects at the same time in advance.I encountered this situation, so that I saw that the main dish came up was a little dumbfounded when the frying was fried, because it was equivalent to the total three dishes of the three dishes.I love the fried objects so much, so I have to doubt whether the chef is born in a tempura.

Except for the ""surprise"" of fried objects, this salmon is quite ordinary in both the plate and the taste (see the attached picture).Why this dish can collect NT $ 1080, it is quite puzzling.The overall feeling is that this store may be famous, so the store has no longer intention to grasp the details.If it is not bartender, I may give 1 star.It should not come again in the future.

近年台北酒吧越開越多，INDULGE 都算老字號了。
我一向很少喝調酒，10 幾年前一喝驚艷，
往後多年，INDULGE 是我招待朋友的首選。

調酒一代傳奇 Aki Wang 成名已久，
INDULGE 的調酒出自他和徒弟之手，
多年始終保持穩定，又不失新意。

做為一家優秀的酒吧，餐點倒是意料之外的好，
INDULGE 的食物很美味，還經常變化，
我個人認為有中上價位西餐廳水準！

友人訪台，想要好吃又要好喝，
INDULGE 是我心目中最靠譜的選擇，
尤其服務品質的穩定度，實在令人佩服。

Aki 親自上陣、設計限定酒款的春節專場，
既是喝回憶又是喝創新，INDULGE 不會讓人失望。","[Drink in Taipei: Indulge Bistro Experimental Innovation Restaurant]

In recent years, the Taipei bar has opened more and more, and Indulge is regarded as the old name.

Aki Wang, a bartender, has become famous for a long time.
INDULGE's bartender comes from his and his apprentices,
It has always maintained stability for many years without losing new intentions.

As an excellent bar, the meal is unexpected.
INDULGE's food is delicious and often changes.

"一間放在我口袋名單很久很久，久到忘記的餐酒館。朋友的邀請讓我有機會品嚐這間亞洲50大餐酒館。

先說氣氛及空間，非常寬敞舒適，一樓的色調很輕，有點介於網美之間，素雅的配色及裝飾間接照明，讓整體氣氛雅緻，很適合女生們的聚會，有聽說B1的裝潢風格截然不同，但這次聊太開心也就沒下樓瞧瞧。

再來說這間調酒真的非常合我胃，可能是運氣好剛好選到的很適合，酒感偏重，酸度及草本都表現的很好，更別說那乾冰的展演，好吸睛啊（狂拍）～朋友則喜歡偏甜的，聽她們說似乎也是很滿意。這名單直接往口袋塞更深，想把其他酒都試一輪這樣。

餐的表現也很好，菜單設計很可愛（沒拍），半圓形的上下翻頁方式，分為陸地跟海洋，喜歡其中一道麵疙瘩，捏成小小顆的口感Q彈，其他餐點有點忘記⋯但都表現很好，起碼在聊天過程我記得都是說著：「好吃！好吃！」

服務都不錯，不會有太多的打擾，也不會打斷客人用餐及聊天，說餐及酒稍稍沒那麼順，但也是清楚好懂沒距離感，九點後的燈光氣氛會調節的更暗，非常有feel，是跟朋友暢談飲酒的好地方，非常喜歡。","A tavern that put on my pocket for a long time and forgotten for a long time.The invitation of my friend gave me the opportunity to taste the 50 big restaurants in Asia.

The decoration style is completely different, but this time I was too happy to go downstairs.

Besides, this bartender really fits my stomach. It may be that the luck is just suitable for choosing. The wine feels heavy, and the acidity and herbal are well performed well, let alone the dried ice performance. It is so eye -catching ( Crazy shot) ~ Friends like to be sweet, and they seem to be very satisfied to listen to them.This list is even more deeper into the pocket, trying to try other wines for a round.

The performance of the meal is also very good. The menu design is very cute (not shot). The semi -circular up and down page turning method is divided into land and the ocean. I like one of the noodles. I forgot a bit, but they all performed well. At least in the chat process, I remember saying: ""It's delicious! It's delicious!""

The service is good, there will be too many disturbances, and it will not interrupt the guests' meal and chat. It is not so smooth to say that the meal and wine are slightly so smooth, but it is also clear that you have no sense of distance. The atmosphere after nine o'clock will be adjusted more.

"本季菜單主題為「山海」
以台灣熱炒、山海風景及環保議題為發想，運用多樣的食材，料理出非比尋常的菜色，口味獨特。
第一次來到創意類型的餐酒館，覺得很有意思，餐點的創意是在外面的餐廳吃不到的，每道菜店員都將食材、調味及廚師的創意講解得很仔細，讓用餐人有參與料理過程的感覺。

但這次是和朋友一般聚餐，共點了六道菜（三道飯麵, 一主餐, 二前菜）我們六個女生幾乎都覺得份量不夠，大概五分飽～

$580 義大利麵/油魚子/鹹蛋黃/松本茸/苦茶油
👉🏻這次用餐最推這道！真的很好吃，麵條硬度、配菜調味都恰到好處，尤其是鹹蛋黃還做到提味，好愛🤤

$650 紫米燉飯/櫻桃鴨/馬告/醃漬鵝菜/鮭魚
👉🏻 份量算夠的一道，櫻桃鴨很嫩、肉算大塊，鮭魚是用鮭魚鬆的方式呈現

$780 雞肉捲/仙草/紅棗/花生/天仙果
👉🏻整口吃下來覺得花生（花生脆片）最好吃🙈雞肉滿嫩的，但是可能仙草/紅棗/天仙果沒有一個東西味道特別突出，所以反而花生脆片印象最深刻

$580 香魚/薯泥/炸小米/刺蔥粉/蝦味奶油醬汁
👉🏻香魚、炸小米餅酥酥香香的很不錯，其他沒有什麼記憶點～

$580 鮮蚵米糕/松葉蟹膏/軟殼蟹/風乾香菇
👉🏻吃下米糕的剎那覺得好熟悉！原來是油飯！但是滿好吃的，不過份量比較少，軟殼蟹的擺拍很用心❤️還有泡泡在周圍～但是反而軟殼蟹沒有什麼記憶點><只記得油飯

$380 藍紋乳酪/豆腐/辣味燒烤醬
👉🏻 這道也很推！超特別的，擺盤也很美，是視覺味覺的雙重饗宴🤤 我本身有點怕藍起司，但是店家把藍起司跟臭豆腐做結合後有壓掉藍起司的味道，變得比較能接受（雖然還是有味道）中心還有一塊豆干，增加了口感

🍸 酒品都很不錯，寓意也很用心，無雷～就不特別評論了

還是感謝餐廳的用心～建議看場合、節日再決定適不適合來用餐","📍Meals 4/5 buckle in the portion

👉🏻 The most pushed dine is the most recommended!True food, noodles hardness, side dishes seasoning are just right, especially the salted egg yolk is also made to taste, love 🤤

👉🏻 The portion is considered enough, cherry duck is very tender, meat is quite large, salmon use salmon loose is presented

$780 Chicken Curl/Sen/Red Date/Peanut/Type
👉🏻 The whole mouth feels peanuts (peanuts crisps) is best to eat 🙈 chicken is tender, but may have fairy grass / red dates / sky fairy fruit sweep there is a particularly prominent taste, so instead peanut crisps are the most impressive

$580 Fragrance / Potato / Fried Xiaomi / sting onion Powder / Shrimp Flavor Butter Sauce
👉🏻 Fish, fried Xiaomi Cake Pastry Pastry Incense is very good, other stumbling what memory spot ~

$580 Freshly oystered rice cake / Matsutake crab paste / soft shell crab / air-dried mushrooms
👉🏻 Eat rice cake I feel familiar!It turns out that dried oil rice!But the portion is relatively small, however the portion is relatively small, the soft shell crab put the shot very carefully ❤️ There are also bubbles around - but the soft shell crab is stumbled with what kind of memory dot >< only remember oil rice

$380 Blue yogurt/tofu/spicy barbecue sauce
👉🏻 The Gaodo is also very pushed!Super special purpose, the plate is also very beautiful, the visual taste double feast🤤 I was a little afraid of blue sewer, but the shop home the blue crest with the stinky tofu after the combination of the blue quarter taste, become more energyAccepts (although remanded in flavor) The center also has a piece of dried beans, increasing the taste

裝潢普通座位沒有很舒適，一樓和B1的風格落差很大，音樂普通希望可以挑選的更有氣氛。調酒方面很不錯，酒單也設計的很用心，酒類處理的非常好。但餐點的部分有點可惜，第一擺盤非常醜。第二雖然是說創意料理但食物的味道彼此混雜並不融合，第一道菇類的前菜腥味很重，第二道的軟殼蟹米糕還不錯（唯一道可以的）主菜的豬肉很硬雖然是伊比利豬但吃起來⋯跟一般的豬一樣，調味也不好。最後的甜點也很傻眼，毫無美感，吃起來也很像一般的豆沙麻糬很怪。價位中上一個人用餐加酒約1800。,"Ordinary seats are not very comfortable.

"真的是慕名而來！大概是名氣太大，從進門的帶位人員，到坐在吧台面對的Bartender , 直到後來換成座位式的服務人員，都沒有溫度，Bartender 甚至讓人感到傲氣！九點到，一開始坐在吧台被告知如果要點菜，必須動作要快，因為餐點有分10點前或10點後，如果是10點前的，準備時間恐怕要半小時，但是我們告知想等到有座位式的空位再開始用餐，吧台告知恐怕要等一陣子才有座位式的位置，結果表情轉為漠然，點了調酒之後，不到五分鐘就有座位式的了！（？不是說要等一陣子？）換到座位式之後我們趕緊點菜，因為之前吧台告知餐點準備需要比較長時間，尤其是10點前的餐點，結果調酒上來的時候，餐點也來了！（？傻眼？） 當天因為樓下包場，所以沒有機會到樓下感受酒吧的氛圍，樓上的裝潢和氛圍整體不足，感覺在非常一般的咖啡廳或是西餐廳。

After changing to the seat style, we quickly ordered, because the meals need to be prepared for a long time, especially at 10 o'clock meals. Also here!(Stupid?)

INDULGE Experimental Bistro

老闆Aki Wang人稱華人雞尾酒之父，王偉勳先生得過三次世界冠軍(1998起瓦士、2000IWSC、2007雪樹)，雖然老闆曾表明「我們一直以來沒有把得獎當目標，反而透過比賽可以看到、學到更多的東西，像是其他酒吧投注了多少心思。我們只是做好本份，並持續在我認定是對的事情上努力。」得到這麼多獎項認可又這麼謙虛，心裡不由得產生至高的敬佩和期待。

INDULGE 將台灣文化融入一切，飲品、餐點，處處都感受得到台灣的元素。菜單及酒單都展現極具用心，每個菜單都對印一個圖案，而圖案是日治時期各地的代表。攤開菜單，連接每張圖的是像火車鐵軌一樣，也代表當時重要的交通工具鐵路一樣，開過台灣各地，感受在地的一切細節。菜單有分10點前後供應要注意噢。
酒單的設計也很有想法和漂亮，除了把歷年來人氣調酒留下來，以台灣24節氣為發想，金木水火土分別代表北中南東和離島，而各元素又有一到三號，一號偏茶，二號偏純，三號帶氣泡。

澳洲穀飼和牛 佐焦化蘿蔔泥和醬漬熟成蛋黃
以台灣鐵板燒文化為發想，熟成蛋黃用刨得在上面，水管麵裡面打進膠狀蘿蔔泥，口感很像地瓜，但，超級好吃啊!還真沒想到反而蘿菠泥是我最喜歡的。和牛肉很嫩，搭配甜甜的焦糖醬，使肉的風味更豐富。

濃蝦湯拉麵 佐生食級天使紅蝦和油封五花肉丁
其實沒有湯哈哈。像是台南擔仔麵的超級升級版，麵有很濃厚的鮮蝦味。
把半熟蛋拌開來，蛋液融入整晚使麵更香。使用阿根廷紅蝦、炸大蒜的香及油封碎豬肉，非常開胃。

開放式秋刀魚三明治
是想試試看秋刀魚，但因產季問題換成比目魚鰭邊肉。番茄、鹽巴已經是鹹的了，和比目魚搭起來更鹹。跟店家建議後，店員Eric很nice的招待了薯條，其實我們只是想建議而已。

炸薯條 佐蒜味蛋黃醬
標準、漂亮又脆的薯條，搭手作蒜香蛋黃醬，和酒果然很match

調酒介紹:

Capitán XXI /王者XXI
當代調酒師之王Dale DeGroff與Aki Wang合作創造的酒款。使用麝香白蘭地、也就是皮斯可Pisco，Maraschino的黑櫻桃酒，曼伽諾陳年香艾酒，而最特別的莫過於戴爾‧迪格洛夫香料苦精。由調酒現代化之父Dale DeGroff自創的，全台只有Indulge擁有並可使用。上面使用的是台灣的椪柑，而非柳橙。雖然$999，因其附加價值高，用著精緻的杯子，這杯充滿藥草香的調酒，會回甘。它不是餐搭酒，它 是主角。

金/元素金一號
使用Roku Gin這支日本琴酒內有6種經典的日本植物：櫻花、櫻花葉、柚子皮、煎茶、玉露、山椒，是支花香很足的一支琴酒;茶香來自包種烏龍的香味;水蜜桃和洋梨散發的果香;野薑花的花香;上頭放的是檸檬馬鞭草，帶出的清爽的風味。很特別的是內有切片蓮霧，是用糖和醋去醃製而成，酸酸甜甜的很開胃。調酒師去了杉林溪，想用調酒呈現杉林溪而創作的，這杯調酒真的讓人彷彿在林中小溪裡悠遊。

木/元素木三號
植物學家琴酒The Botanist是瓶在艾雷島上手工採集挑選出22種最具特色的植物，並用目前世上唯一的羅夢式蒸餾器低壓文火緩慢蒸餾，帶出淡淡杜松子，檸檬皮，柚子皮香氣，像一種複合式精油的感覺。加入曼伽諾甘味相愛酒，還有內容絕不外傳的草藥酒之王Green Chartreuse。白肖木和松木使之有草本木質調，搭配白酒、氣泡感和薑的香味，造就這杯非常豐富、複雜、極度層次的風味。

Liquor is Your Soul Spirit

水/元素水二號
基酒為Don Julio Tequila Blanco，像瑪格麗特一樣的鹽口杯，但鹽的來歷可不普通，是用阿里山山葵鹽。霧峰的初露濁酒，有點似小米酒，甜甜的。撒點珍珠粉，旁邊Garnish則是羽葉薰衣草。杯下放置乾冰，散發出的霧氣，彷彿像早晨的阿里山一樣，舒適且神祕。

火/元素火二號
白蘭地和酩帝威士忌搭配，使用台灣紅藜麥和糯米，帶有米的香、米的甜。煙霧的成生則是燒肉桂粉，遠遠就聞到香濃的錫蘭肉桂。入口後，巧克力堅果味撲鼻而來，微微的甜味。有趣的是，喝了一半之後，產生出咖啡的風味，風味的轉變令人驚奇，感覺適合短飲。

土/元素土一號
唐胡立歐龍舌蘭，搭配酸梅汁、仙人掌、胡椒、柚子，而茶的部分為屏東港口茶，種植在全台灣最南端、海拔最低的茶種，帶有淡淡的海風味，是非常特殊的好茶，也是「恆春三寶」之一。而且茶園多半很小，都是茶農自己手工摘採，產量很少，不會外銷出口，更別說能在一般茶行找得到。能在品嘗到真是榮幸。這杯烏梅味十足的濃厚，上有陳年梅，先吃再喝很不一樣。搭配紫蘇葉，整杯變得很清爽，略帶小酒感。

這邊的Shot有一杯很特別，是以威士忌為主，加入荔枝和百草，喝起來不烈，淡淡酒感、輕柔的果香。服務生Eric人既專業又熱情，不管是人或環境，都充滿著溫度。在這邊喝個酒、吃個飯，想著一整天發生的事，或和朋友家人聚聚，感受這裡的氛圍，而這一切都是用心堆成的。

Indulge，滿足。","IG: Bar_runner_elijah
Indullge Experimental Bistro

The boss Aki Wang said that the father of the Chinese cocktail, and Mr. Wang Weixun won three World Champions (1998 Wats, 2000IWSC, 2007 Snow Tree). I have learned more about what I have bet on other bars. Supreme admiration and expectations.

Indulge integrates Taiwan culture into everything, drinks, meals, and feels Taiwan's elements everywhere.The menu and wine lists are very careful. Each menu is printed on a pattern, and the pattern is a representative of various places during the Japanese rule.The menu is spread out. The connection to each picture is like a train rail, which also represents the important transportation railway at that time. It drove all the details of the local area and feel all the details of the local area.Pay attention to the menu before 10 o'clock.
The design of the wine list is also very thoughtful and beautiful. In addition to leaving the popular bartender over the years, taking Taiwan ’s 24 solar terms as an imagination, Jinmu, water, fire, and soil represent North, Central South East and the islands, and each element is one to 3rd. No. 1 is partial tea, No. 2 is pure, and the third is bubble.

Australian valley feed and beef coking radish mud and sauce are cooked into egg yolk
Using Taiwan's iron plate burning culture as an imagination, cooked egg yolk is planed on it. The water pipe surface is made into a glue radish mud, and the taste is very much like sweet potato, but it is super delicious! Favorite.The beef is very tender, and the sweet caramel sauce makes the flavor of the meat richer.

Shrimp Smart Ramen Sasheng Food Class Angel Red Shrimp and Oil Seal Wutin Pork Ding
In fact, there is no soup haha.Like the super -upgraded version of Tainan's Noodle Noodle, the noodles have a strong flavor of fresh shrimp.
Mix the half -cooked eggs, and the egg liquid is integrated into the night to make the noodles more fragrant.It is very appetizing using Argentine red shrimp, fried garlic fragrance and oil sealing pork, which is very appetizing.

Open autumn saury sandwiched
I want to try autumn saury, but it is replaced by the fir fins because of the birth season.Tomatoes and salt are already salty, and they are more salty than fish.After suggesting to the store, the clerk Eric enrolled fries very nice. In fact, we just wanted to suggest.

French fries, garlic flavor egg yolk sauce
Standard, beautiful and crispy fries, put on hand as garlic egg yolk sauce, and wine really matches

There is an old man on the top. It is very different to eat and drink first.With the perilla leaves, the whole cup became very refreshing, with a little wine.

餐點部分我們非常推薦馬告骰子牛排味道10分濃郁又很具備台灣特色的一道料理，熟成起司山蘇也非常特別，使用mimolette起司，再搭配台灣味十足的炒山蘇，中西合併的味覺火花，顛覆了過去我們對這些料理的想像！

I especially like this shop staff who will have a very detailed meal introduction or the story behind this dish when serving. What is impressed is that when the bartender is served at the table, the clerk and us shared the story of the boss to participate in the bartender competition abroad. It is to use some ingredients in bartending to represent the main axis selling point of the game.

In the meal section, we highly recommend a dish with the characteristics of the horse's dice and steak flavors. It is very special with Taiwanese characteristics. It is also very special to mature the cheese Yamasu. Use MIMOLETTE cheese, combined with Taiwanese flavors of mountains and Soviets.

I sincerely recommend evaluation, everyone's view is different
But I have been there when SAM are in the sam, and I have not been inferior to because of many years of meals and alcohol.
If you want to eat rough, I really recommend that you don't come first
Western cuisine really needs time and kung fu, and alcohol, otherwise I will go to the nightclub to drink

"這季的菜單以台灣的山海為主題，使用了許多台灣在地的食材
鹹蛋黃義大利麵用了許多松本菇，但是麵體本身並不會有很重的菇味，反而有著清爽的風味，搭配上鹹蛋黃的味道使得整個味道更有層次
炸鮮蚵炸的恰到好處，不會太老也不會有粉粉的口感
調酒的部分這季酒單以五行搭配台灣的五個地區去設計，菜單非常有質感不過我覺得跟地區的連結並沒有太強烈，但是調酒本身都很好喝
木元素1號整體酒體飽滿味道偏甜，以龍眼的香氣為主題搭配桂花跟荔枝的味道，蠻適合當作第二杯
水元素2號帶著清爽的薰衣草香氣使得龍舌蘭的味道不會太過明顯，搭配杯口的山葵粉喝會使得這杯酒變成完全不一樣的風味，有點鹹香的味道將原本龍舌蘭的味道給帶出變成完全不同的酒，非常適合當作第一杯
水元素3號以香菜為主的味道搭配芝麻跟椰子味，綿密的氣泡很適合解膩可以當作最後一杯","The menu of this season is based on the mountains and seas of Taiwan, and many of the local ingredients in Taiwan have been used.
The salted egg yolk has a lot of Matsumoto mushrooms, but the facade itself does not have a very heavy mushroom flavor. Instead, it has a refreshing flavor. The taste of salted egg yolk makes the whole taste more layered.
The fried fresh fried is just right, it will not be too old or there will be a pink taste
The seasons of the bartender are designed with the five regions of Taiwan with five elements. The menu is very textured but I think the connection with the region is not too strong, but the bartender itself is delicious.
Wood Element 1 The overall wine is full of sweet taste. It is used with the taste of osmanthus and lychee with the theme of longan.
Water Element 2 with a refreshing lavender aroma makes the smell of agave not too obvious. Drinking it with a cup of cup can make this glass of wine completely different flavor. The taste of the tongue brings out a completely different wine, which is very suitable as the first cup
Water Element 3 is based on coriander -based flavors with sesame and coconut flavor. The dense bubbles are very suitable for decomposition and can be used as the last cup.",False

"我很期待這個地方，因為顯然它在亞洲 50 強酒吧中排名很高，但不幸的是我發現它有點令人失望。氣氛很好，服務生很細心，樂於助人。我吃的食物非常好，我不記得名字了，但那是蝦仁燴飯，配上薄薄的和牛片。這是用餐體驗中最好的部分。

我必須提供更多關於飲料的細節，因為這最終是一個酒吧 - 他們很遺憾地時好時壞。我覺得人們花了很多精力來調製一些有趣的雞尾酒，但其中很多似乎都很花哨而且缺乏味道。例如，對於我的第一杯飲料（“Wood Flora”），他們在上菜時只是在上面噴灑了某種芳香香水？對於我的第二個（“復古木頭”），它附帶了一小袋冰糖，你應該一邊喝酒一邊吃，表面上是在體驗中增加了糖果的響聲。對於菜單上寫的威士忌和可樂的一些變體，這是令人失望的。我的第三杯飲料（“Flora Wood”）非常棒，這很令人驚訝，因為它的細節看起來很奇怪，包括蘆薈、菠蘿、椰子、*爆米花*和海鹽牛奶，但不知何故它確實有效。

飲料的價格在 400 到 500 台幣之間，我希望能多喝一點。考慮到台北有多少雞尾酒吧，我不確定這個地方是否值得大肆宣傳。我建議嘗試一下，但不值得太麻煩。","I look forward to this place, because it obviously it ranks high in the top 50 bars in Asia, but unfortunately I find it a bit disappointing.The atmosphere is very good, the waiter is very careful and helpful.The food I eat is very good. I don't remember the name, but that is shrimp risotto, with a thin and cotton slices.This is the best part of the dining experience.

I have to provide more details about drinks, because this is eventually a bar -they regretful and bad.I think people have spent a lot of energy to prepare some interesting cocktails, but many of them seem to be fancy and lacking.For example, for my first cup of drink (""Wood Flora""), they just sprayed some kind of aromatic perfume when she served?For my second (""retro wood""), it comes with a small bag of rock sugar. You should eat while drinking. On the surface, the sound of the candy is added to the experience.This is disappointing for some variants of whiskey and cola written on the menu.My third cup of drink (""Flora Wood"") is very good, which is surprising because its details look strange, including aloe, pineapple, coconut,*popcorn*and sea salt milk, but somehow it is indeed indeed indeed it is indeed efficient.

The price of the drink is between 400 and 500 Taiwan dollars, and I hope to drink a little more.Considering how many cocktail bars in Taipei, I am not sure if this place is worthy of publicity.I suggest try it, but it is not too troublesome.",False
"找台灣朋友幫忙訂的，但是星期日晚上去的，還沒訂滿。

我不會說普通話，但格蕾絲在那裡幫助解釋概念、菜單，還根據你的喜好幫助推薦東西。

我點了兩道開胃菜（巴伐利亞海膽和蝦醬）和一份和牛蝦濃湯燴飯。擺盤很簡潔，但味道也很好！強烈推薦蝦醬和燴飯。

我還請格蕾絲將飲料與食物搭配。對於開胃菜，我從他們的菜單中得到了它，無論今年的概念如何，菜單都保留在那裡。這正是我想要的：乾淨、順滑，帶有一絲薑百合花/蘋果的果香，不會與開胃菜的精緻味道發生衝突。至於義大利調味飯，有人向我推薦了一種加了羅勒和綠茶的威士忌飲料。令我驚訝的是，這是非常互補的，因為味道並沒有壓倒這道菜。然後甜點我喝了一杯含有蘆薈、鳳梨、爆米花、海鹽牛奶的飲料。這是一種完美的甜點飲料。

最重要的是，與格蕾絲交談真是令人愉快！我是一個單獨旅行者，還有另一個單獨旅行者，我們三個人都談論了很多不同的事情，從食物和飲料推薦到文化交流！

I also invite Grace to match the drink with food.For appetizing dishes, I got it from their menus, no matter what this year's concept, the menu is kept there.This is what I want: clean and smooth, with a hint of ginger lily/apple fruity aroma, which will not conflict with the delicate taste of appetizers.As for the Italian seasoning, someone recommended a whiskey drink with Lales and Green Tea.What surprised me was that this was very complementary, because the taste did not overwhelm the dish.Then I drank a drink containing aloe, pineapple, popcorn, sea salt milk.This is a perfect dessert drink.

我也很高興嘗試菜單上的食物，但我想要的大部分選項在我們晚上 9 點的預訂時都賣完了。他們也有更簡單的深夜菜單。我們嘗試的食物還不錯，儘管很容易忘記。不過，我對這裡富有創意且均衡的雞尾酒感到非常震驚。從 Metal No. 1 的芬芳烏龍茶和核果香調，到 Metal No. 2 的濃鬱木質香水，這裡的範圍令人難以置信。我喝過的一些最好的雞尾酒！","Aki Wang's Indulge Experimental Bistro provides impressive diverse cocktails.

當我們第一次進入時，它不像我以前去過的任何其他高端酒吧/餐廳，最初的服務員給了我們區分陸地和海洋的菜單，但在建議我們點任何飲料之前給了我們菜單。我有點失望，但這可能是因為我不會說普通話，只有我的搭檔會說（他不需要說太多）。格蕾絲最終為我們服務，非常樂於助人，而且非常了解茶和雞尾酒。食物很美味，但最終還是雞尾酒。裝飾有點過時，主要是關於體驗（顧名思義），所以建議像我/我們一樣在酒吧找個座位。再次感謝,"When we first entered, it was not like any other high -end bars/restaurants I have been to.

"2018/11/23（4.1）套餐+一些單點
*環境：還算明亮，但空間有點小，桌數不多，但聽說有地下室，有時候會有人包場。覺得其他桌聊天聲音有點吵雜，會有點影響。
*服務：店員解釋的蠻清楚的，但因為聊天聲音有些吵雜，故有些聽不清楚。
*麵包、湯：湯很濃鬱，搭配麵包不錯，麵包本身也很有香氣，口感也很好。
*菜色：
-花椒鹹豬肉水波蛋菱角：非常特別的組合，而且意外的搭。鹹豬肉片搭配酸甜的水波蛋醬，讓層次提升，菱角的鬆軟和豬肉片則是提升口感層次，具有巧思的一道菜
-酥炸雞翅：肉質嫩，外表脆，沒想到搭配的竟是有點辣味的巧克力餅乾粉，也破有特色
-羊排佐北飛小米：筋微多，但小米和醬搭起來十分出色
-魚排義大利麵：本日最大驚喜，原本是想說來點個澱粉類，怕會餓，選了桌上立牌才有的菜，沒想到成為今日亮點。麵條不軟爛，魚新鮮，最愛的是醬汁，完美包裹麵條，而且味覺不單只有鳳尾魚或是奶油味，層次繽紛。
-肋眼牛排佐辣椒：本日最貴但最失望，肉太柴太韌，搭配辣醬食用會好一點，不會太辣，讓單調牛排多了一點點綴。
*酒類也是一大賣點，酒單外表就美的像喜帖一樣，茶酒溫潤，不會太澀，非常順口。另外打卡送的shot也太好喝，完全不辣不澀，真的可以一口乾。
*甜點：布雷很密，不是布丁的那種假彈性，上面鋪了一些餅乾和梅果醬，個人認為有點多餘了。
整體來說，適合小酌，餐點和酒都十分有特色也都屬佳作，而且時間到了沒有客人也不會趕人。缺點大概是牛排不如預期和周圍有些吵雜。","2018/11/23 (4.1) package+some single points
*Environment: It's bright, but the space is a bit small, and there are not many tables, but I heard that there is a basement, and sometimes there are people who charter the field.I feel that the sound of other table chatting is a bit noisy and will affect it.
*Service: The clerk explained clearly, but because the chat sound was a bit noisy, some of them couldn't hear clearly.
*Bread and soup: The soup is very strong, the bread is good, the bread itself is also very fragrant, and the taste is also very good.
*Dish:
-Pillopia salted pork water wave egg rhodochromes: very special combination, and unexpectedly.Salted pork slices with sweet and sweet water wave egg sauce can be improved. The softness and pork slices of diamonds and pork slices are a ingenious dish with ingenuity.
-Stime fried chicken wings: tender meat and crispy appearance. I did not expect that it was a bit of spicy chocolate biscuit powder, which also broke the characteristic
-Anep chocolate Zobei Xiaomi: There are many tendons, but Xiaomi and sauce are very good
-Fish row of Italian noodles: The biggest surprise today, originally wanted to say that it was a starch, for fear of being hungry. I chose the dishes that had been established on the table. I did not expect to be the highlight of today.The noodles are not soft, the fish is fresh, the favorite is sauce, perfectly wrapped the noodles, and the taste is not only a phoenix fish or creamy flavor, the layers are colorful.
-Crocytic steak pepper: The most expensive but most disappointed this day. The meat is too firewood and tough. It will be better to eat with spicy sauce. It will not be too spicy.
*The wine is also a big selling point. The appearance of the wine is like a wedding invitation. The tea and wine are moist, not too astringent, and very smooth.In addition, the shot sent by punch in is too delicious, it is not spicy or astringent, and it can really do it in one bite.
*Dessert: Brey is very dense, not the pseudo -elasticity of pudding. There are some biscuits and plum jam on it. I personally think that it is a bit redundant.

I like the way they cooperate with local farmers.Their drink menu has 36 carefully prepared cocktails, each with its own story.Try the aging cocktail and the 15 -day bucket whiskey.We (the first time) went to Halloween, and the basement was decorated just right.The waiter provided us with the entire experience, because his English was close to his mother tongue, and his knowledge was very careful all night.The menu is often replaced, but the staff always knows what to recommend.

"這家體驗式小酒館確實做了很多實驗來發現新的雞尾酒。從雞尾酒菜單設計開始，菜單用矩陣清晰地解釋了口味、風格和強度的渴望。許多雞尾酒都融入了台灣當地元素。

我來的那天晚上是晚餐後。被雞尾酒的品質所吸引，看看其他人在吃什麼，我決定再點一些食物。提供的食物不僅僅是“小酒館”。

我確信下次來台北時，我還會再來這裡。","This experiential tavern does have a lot of experiments to discover new cocktails.Starting from the design of the cocktail menu, the menu clearly explains the desire of taste, style and strength with matrix.Many cocktails are incorporated into the local elements of Taiwan.

"在幾次嘗試向服務員揮手後，我不得不走到酒吧點飲料，但沒有人承認我們。

"我們在網路上找到了一家著名的小酒館，還有一些朋友推薦，所以我們抱著很高的期望去了，但是他們失敗了。服務很一般，服務生沒有打招呼和歡迎，也沒有介紹他們的菜單、雞尾酒，甚至問我們是否想要一些水。因為我們正在等待服務器來接受訂單，所以我們感到被冷落了。
雞尾酒還可以。我們點了一瓶白酒，令我們驚訝的是他們沒有主動提供冰桶，我們必須要。
總而言之，沒有什麼特別的，但氛圍很棒，很舒適，僅此而已。","We found a famous tavern on the Internet, and some friends recommended, so we went with high expectations, but they failed.The service is very average. The waiter did not say hello and welcome, and did not introduce their menus, cocktails, and even asked if we wanted some water.Because we are waiting for the server to accept the order, we feel cold.

來這裡慶祝我的生日並度過了非常愉快的時光。我們沒有預訂桌子，所以不得不坐在吧台，但這很好。對於高檔酒吧來說，食物品質好、味道好、價格合理。飲料很棒。他們有一位來自上海的客座調酒師，他非常友好並且對飲料菜單很了解。 「君度水瓶座」雞尾酒是一場很棒的生日慶祝活動。,"Come here to celebrate my birthday and live a very happy time.We did not book a table, so we had to sit on the bar, but it was good.For high -end bars, food quality, good taste, and reasonable price.The drink is great.They have a guest bartender from Shanghai.

"Indulge Experimental Bistro 每次都讓我感到驚訝。他們的雞尾酒根據台灣不同的地理區域進行分類。他們甚至採用了各自地區最著名的成分/食品成分來製作這些招牌飲料。從每一杯酒就能看出他們調酒師的技術有多高超。各種食材的味道混合得很好，同時又相互補充，因此您可以單獨識別它們。

另一個優點是他們的菜餚。我們點了豆腐乳燴飯，這是無法形容的。總的來說，我認為 Indulge Experimental Bistro 躋身前 50 名是有充分理由的。","INDULGE Experimental Bistro surprised me every time.Their cocktails are classified according to different geographical areas in Taiwan.They even use the most famous ingredients/food ingredients in their respective regions to make these signature drinks.From each glass of wine, we can see how superb the technology of their bartender is.The taste of all kinds of ingredients is mixed well, and at the same time, you can supplement each other, so you can identify them alone.

來到這裡感受這裡的氛圍，並在這家頂級酒吧和酒廊享用精心調製的訂製雞尾酒。雖然他們的菜單上有很多食物，但晚上喝一杯還是很不錯的。預計這裡會有一種寒冷的氣氛，非常西化，並以柔和的木色調裝飾。雞尾酒菜單是一流的，菜單外的選項（與服務器交談）確實很有趣。,"Come here to feel the atmosphere here, and enjoy the carefully prepared cocktail in this top bar and lounge.Although their menu has a lot of food, it is still very good to drink a cup at night.It is expected that there will be a cold atmosphere here, which is very western and decorated with soft wooden tone.The cocktail menu is first -class, and the options outside the menu (talking to the server) are really interesting.",False

我去過的最好的餐廳和酒吧之一。服務生非常友善和有禮貌，會用英語解釋一切，如果你需要的話。這裡的雞尾酒非常有趣，有很多亞洲靈感，菜單經常更換。總的來說，這是我去過的最好的地方之一，我認為絕對必須嘗試,"One of the best restaurants and bars I have been to.The waiter is very friendly and polite to explain everything in English, if you need it.The cocktails here are very interesting, there are many Asia inspirations, and the menu is often replaced.Overall, this is one of the best places I have been.

2020 年 5 月 23 日與幾個朋友一起參觀了 Indulge Bistro。它隱藏在東區的瑰寶中。 Indulge 在舒適的氛圍中提供了絕佳的體驗，不僅提供食物和雞尾酒，還提供周到的服務。台北很棒的酒吧。,"On May 23, 2020, I visited Indulge Bistro with a few friends.It is hidden in the treasures of the Eastern District.Indulge provides an excellent experience in a comfortable atmosphere, not only provides food and cocktails, but also provides thoughtful services.Taipei is a great bar.",False
氣氛還可以。飲料很好。有趣的是我和我先生一起去的──我是亞洲人，他是美國白人；我說中文，他說英語。  酒保對他好多了。  當他介紹和介紹我的飲料時，他選擇說英語，並一直看著我的搭檔，就好像我是隱形的一樣。哈哈,"The atmosphere is okay.The drink is very good.The interesting thing is what I went with my husband -I am Asian, he is a white American; I speak Chinese and he speak English.The wine insurance is much better to him.When he introduced and introduced my drink, he chose to speak English and always looked at my partner, as if I was invisible.Ha ha",False
"這是一家躋身亞洲前 50 名的時尚酒吧，這是有充分理由的。他們有時尚的氛圍，創意飲料菜單，以台灣海邊到山區的酷炫主題。服務非常好，當我要求用當地威士忌卡瓦蘭調製的雞尾酒時，我們的服務員向我解釋了飲料的味道，並為我調製了一杯創意雞尾酒。
他們樓下還有一家只在溢出時開放的商店，但主題非常酷（他們真的應該全職開放！）
飲料和食品的價格非常合理，特別是考慮到它的時尚程度。
好地方！","This is a fashion bar that ranks among the top 50 in Asia, which is sufficient.They have a fashionable atmosphere, creative beverage menu, with the cool themes from the sea to the mountains.The service is very good. When I asked the cocktail prepared by the local whiskey Cavan, our waiter explained the taste of the drink and prepared a cup of creative cocktail for me.
There is also a shop that is only open when it overflows, but the theme is very cool (they should really open all -time!)
The price of beverages and food is very reasonable, especially considering its fashion level.
Good place!",False
令人驚嘆的雞尾酒很樂意再次去。,The amazing cocktail is happy to go again.,False
工作人員很好。雞尾酒的價格高於平均水平,The staff is very good.The price of cocktails is higher than the average level,False
許多招牌雞尾酒，漂亮的小而整潔的酒廊酒吧外觀的地方。當我想喝一杯好酒時，肯定會出現在我的口袋清單上。,"Many signature cocktails, beautiful small and neat lounges.When I want to drink a glass of good wine, I will definitely appear on my pocket list.",False
台北市必去的酒吧。不僅雞尾酒很好吃，食物也很美味。,"A must -go bar in Taipei City.Not only is cocktails delicious, but also delicious food.",False
食物很一般，調酒師的服務也很普通。他們所有人都彬彬有禮且專業，但只是最低限度的。其中一個確實給了我一個機會，我很感激，但確實有這樣的情況。飲料很好，如果你在台灣，你應該至少來一次。,"The food is very average, and the service of the bartender is also very common.They are polite and professional, but they are only minimum.One of them did give me a chance. I am grateful, but there is indeed such a situation.The drink is very good, if you are in Taiwan, you should come at least once.",False
"我們總共喝了大約 10 種不同的飲料，其中超過一半都感到失望。這些飲料沒有創意，味道平淡無味。菜單設計由 5 個單字的 25 種排列組成，導航非常混亂。服務員的描述充滿了廢話，並且知道我的飲料是受到調酒師母親的啟發並沒有讓它變得更美味。他們的歷史簽名位於菜單的後面，但即使是那些也沒有給人留下深刻的印象。
我幾乎不會稱這是一家好的雞尾酒吧，更不用說亞洲排名第 11 的雞尾酒吧了。
好的一面是，氣氛很好，薯條也很美味。","We drank about 10 different drinks in total, more than half of them were disappointed.These beverages are not creative and tasteless.The menu design consists of 5 types of words in 5 single characters, and the navigation is very chaotic.The description of the waiter is full of nonsense, and knowing that my drink was inspired by the maternal mother's mother, it did not make it more delicious.Their historical signature is behind the menu, but even those who have not left a deep impression.
I hardly call this a good cocktail bar, let alone the 11th cocktail bar in Asia.
The good side is that the atmosphere is very good, and the fries are also delicious.",False

這裡的經驗真的很令人失望。我預訂了 Indulge Bistro，因為它在我伴侶 30 歲生日時享有盛譽。當我們晚上 9 點到達時，我們被告知幾乎所有菜單都消失了，但到那時我們已經無處可去了。結果我們不得不錯過晚餐。工作人員對此表示歉意，但令人失望，因為我們一直期待著參觀。提前警告我們沒有晚餐菜單會這麼困難嗎？,"The experience here is really disappointing.I booked Indulge Bistro because it enjoyed a high reputation on my 30th birthday.When we arrived at 9 o'clock in the evening, we were told that almost all menus disappeared, but then we had nowhere to go.As a result, we had to miss dinner.The staff apologized, but disappointing because we have been looking forward to visiting.Is it difficult to warn us in advance that there is no dinner menu?",False
飲料有點甜，果味濃鬱，絕對不適合雞尾酒愛好者。他們建議堅持菜單。我不知道。就我個人而言，只有當您想要輕鬆品嚐並由其他人選擇您的飲料時才會推薦。,"The drink is a bit sweet, rich in fruit, and it is definitely not suitable for cocktail enthusiasts.They recommend insisting the menu.I have no idea.Personally, I recommend it only when you want to taste it easily and choose your drink by others.",False
氣氛非常好，裝潢現代時尚。食物擺盤精美，經過深思熟慮。不過發現味道有點淡。烹飪方法並沒有真正豐富和提升味道。飲料很平均。,"The atmosphere is very good, decorated with modern fashion.The food is exquisite and thoughtfully.But the taste was a bit light.The cooking method is not really rich and enhanced.Drinks are average.",False
食物不錯，但份量很小而且價格昂貴。雞尾酒很好喝，我很喜歡。,"The food is good, but the portion is small and the price is expensive.Cocktails are delicious, I like it very much.",False
喜歡這個地方，這裡有多種雞尾酒可供選擇。我們確實玩得很開心。,"Like this place, there are a variety of cocktails to choose from.We really have fun.",False
"令人失望。食物和雞尾酒菜單非常有創意。不幸的是，我感興趣的許多菜餚和飲料都沒有了，這是在我嘗試點餐後他們告訴我的（當時才晚上 8 點！）。這令人沮喪。他們可能應該在不可用的菜單項目上貼上膠帶或將其劃掉或其他什麼。我們點了 4 道菜，1 道菜非常好，2 道菜還不錯，1 道菜很無聊。雞尾酒非常好。

飯後，服務生給我們每人一杯櫻桃利口酒，作為對沒有告訴我們這麼多事情的歉意。那太好了。但是，在一家高檔而昂貴的餐廳，剛開始吃飯就被告知幾乎所有你想要的東西都沒有，這真是太糟糕了。

伺服器非常好。","Disappointment.Food and cocktail menu is very creative.Unfortunately, many dishes and beverages I am interested in are gone. This is what they told me after I tried to order (only 8 pm at that time!).This is frustrating.They may put tapes on an unused menu item or draw them out or other.We ordered 4 dishes, 1 dish is very good, 2 dishes are not bad, and 1 dish is boring.Cocktails are very good.

After a meal, the waiter gave us a glass of cherry liquor for each of us, as an apology that did not tell us so many things.That's great.However, in a high -end and expensive restaurant, I was told that almost everything you wanted at the beginning was not. This is really bad.

The server is very good.",False
真的很棒的雞尾酒。強烈推薦。值得特別去參觀。可以嘗試在下午 6:30 左右開門時步行，否則應該嘗試提前一個月左右預訂。食物實際上是一個非常好的驚喜，因為一切都很美味。,"It's really good cocktail.Strongly recommended.It is worth visiting.You can try to walk when you open the door around 6:30 in the afternoon, otherwise you should try to book about one month in advance.Food is actually a very good surprise, because everything is delicious.",False
令人難以置信的令人愉快。每一分錢都值得。不要猶豫，來這裡吧，因為每一種雞尾酒都很美味而且獨特。荷蘭水手號和冷露號與我以前吃過的任何東西都不一樣,"Unbelievable and pleasant.Every penny is worth it.Don't hesitate, come here, because every cocktail is delicious and unique.The Dutch Waterman and Cold Loire are different from anything I have eaten before",False

缺點是價位不便宜，但跟朋友放鬆聊天喝點酒是蠻不錯的地方！","The service is intimate and professional, the food is distinctive and delicious, and it can not eat a similar taste outside!There is no special research on the wine, but my friends feel good.It is specially recommended to roast pig's feet, scallops salad, and cooked plum pigs.The waiter is very familiar with the wine list and menu in the store, and you can ask them to introduce them.I do n’t know what time (maybe 9 o'clock?)

來這裡是因為它被列為亞洲 50 家最佳酒吧之一，它並沒有讓人失望。這裡有多種雞尾酒可供選擇，調酒師非常友好且樂於助人，因此請不要猶豫向他們尋求建議。飲料很棒，我們點的薯條也很好吃。伺服器非常有禮貌和周到，所以這也是一個巨大的優勢。,"Here is because it is listed as one of the 50 best bars in Asia, it is not disappointing.There are a variety of cocktails to choose from.

他們在飲料上用了假花，讓我感覺~很貴。我們兩個花了大約1400新台幣，連世界前50名的酒吧都達不到。在東京，世界頂級的SG Club和Ben Fiddich都有很多實惠的飲料。以他們所提供的服務來說，沉迷太貴了。,"They used fake flowers on the beverage, making me feel ~ very expensive.The two of us spent about 1,400 Taiwan dollars, not even the top 50 bars in the world.In Tokyo, the world's top SG Club and Ben Fiddich have many affordable drinks.For the services they provide, the obsession is too expensive.",False
來吃深夜晚餐。我們正在開車，所以沒有機會嘗試雞尾酒，但即便如此，非酒精飲料還是很美味。食物以台灣當地食材為特色，我們點的意大利調味飯和意大利麵都非常美味。總的來說，這頓飯有點貴，但我認為對於特殊場合來說這會很棒。一定會再回來。,"Come to eat late -night dinner.We are driving, so we have no chance to try cocktails, but even so, non -alcoholic beverages are still delicious.Food is characterized by local ingredients in Taiwan.

"優質的食品和飲料，氛圍良好，但考慮到風味的深度和雞尾酒的平衡，價格有點過高。

"🥕十分之九的胡蘿蔔🥕
雞尾酒矩陣的佈局令人印象深刻，並提供多種選擇以滿足不同的口味。雖然我們整個晚上選擇的四杯雞尾酒都不錯，但我們並沒有覺得其中任何一杯都超級“哇”（也許我們對亞洲 50 強酒吧之一的期望太高了？）。然而，在所有其他方面，他們確實讓我們「驚嘆」。食物的味道非常出色，顯然在烹飪和擺盤方面需要技術。服務員經常詢問情況如何以及是否可以提供任何進一步的幫助。為了結束我們的約會之夜，我們得到了一張遠離桌子主要區域的超大沙發。一個美妙而有趣的夜晚。

週四晚上來到這裡，不用等桌子。我聽說週末人滿為患，所以如果您想避開人群，工作日晚上可能是一個不錯的選擇。我真的很喜歡這裡的飲料和食物。我嘗試的飲料：拉莫斯琴酒和橡木威士忌雞尾酒，裝在裝有乾冰的盒子裡。它們很好，但不像“這是我吃過的最好的”。服務很好；服務生真的很細心。,"Come here on Thursday night, no need to wait for the table.I heard that people are overcrowded on weekends, so if you want to avoid the crowd, it may be a good choice on working day.I really like the drinks and food here.I tried drinks: Ramos and oak whiskeys cocktails, packed in boxes equipped with dry ice.They are good, but not like ""this is the best I have ever eaten.""The service is very good; the waiter is really careful.",False
他們以軍事紀律嚴格執行 3 小時的用餐時間限制——無論你花了多少錢，也不管是否有顧客在等待。我們買了三輪飲料（以台灣標準來說是淫穢的）。他們仍然告訴我們時間到了。他們對我們撒謊說有顧客在等待。事實上，沒有人在等待，而且有多張桌子是空的。他們可能對如何將飲料混合成雞尾酒略知一二，但在服務方面他們還有很長的路要走。絕對不值得頂點評！,"They strictly implement the 3 -hour dining time limit with military discipline -no matter how much money you spent, no matter whether there are customers waiting.We bought a three -wheeled drink (for Taiwan standards).They still tell us that time is here.They lied to us and said that customers were waiting.In fact, no one is waiting, and there are multiple tables empty.They may know how to mix drinks into cocktails, but they still have a long way to go in terms of service.Definitely worthy of the comment!",False
