酒單每一季的變化真的都很辛苦，感謝吧天德的努力！但上次和今年落差真的有點大，店員能詳細詢問自己的喜愛，去推薦特調，且對自家酒單不會只說好聽的話，反而能真實呈現！服務真的很到位！很悠閒的體驗！照片是我個人喜愛的，下次再去嘗試新口味！,"The change in each season of the wine list is really hard, thank you Tiande for your efforts!But the gap last and this year is really a bit big. The clerk can ask his favorite in detail, recommend the special adjustment, and do not just say good words to your own wine list, but you can truly present it!The service is really in place!Very leisurely experience!I personally love the photo, and try new flavors next time!"

"沒想到在南京東路柏克金餐酒館上
還有一間噶瑪蘭威士忌酒吧

不要客氣的上二樓
一進店內會看到好多的木桶
這都是滿滿的威士忌
這兒真是威士忌的天堂
但
我是來這喝威士忌調酒的

菜單的設計是滿滿的台灣味
畢竟噶瑪蘭是台灣在地品牌
融入了很多生活中的味道
像是李塩冰、榕樹下和芒果園
都是我們生活中的風味
喜歡這樣的主題
不止吸引我們在地人
也有不少的外國人
非常有趣很適合帶外國友人來嚐嚐

酒單設計的好
調酒也不馬乎
每杯都可以喝到想傳達的意境
視覺效果也很好
雖然單價不低
但台北寸土寸金這也是沒辦法的事

在這還遇到之前認識的bartender
台北的調酒就是這麼迷人","I did not expect
There is also a Karmaland whiskey bar

Don't be polite to the second floor
I will see a lot of wooden buckets when I enter the store
This is full of whiskey
This is really whiskey's paradise
but
I am here to drink whiskey and bartender

The design of the menu is full of Taiwanese flavor
After all, Karmaland is a local brand in Taiwan
Incorporate a lot of taste in life
Such as Li Yibing, Banyan Tree and Mango Garden
They are all the flavors in our lives
Like this theme
Not only attracts us local people
There are also many foreigners
Very interesting, very suitable for bringing foreign friends to taste

Wine list is well designed
Blooming is not stable
You can drink the artistic conception you want to convey each cup
The visual effect is also very good
Although the unit price is not low
But the Taipei inch soil gold is not a way.

I also encountered Bartender you met before
The bartender in Taipei is so charming"
"12點last order1點close 11點40-50分酒不讓點 12:5分寫review

Btw 因為我們不是唯一的桌 所以不能12點last order 因為還有別桌 我們不是唯一的桌

8月12晚班全體 說話當時只有兩桌","12 o'clock Last Order at 11 points CLOSE 11: 40-50, do not let point 12: 5 write Review

Because we are not the only table, it cannot be 12 o'clock Last Order because there are other tables that we are not the only table

On the evening of August 12, the whole class spoke only two tables at the time"
"威士忌太厲害了吧⋯
可以點三重奏，能從酒單上（應該有十幾種二十幾種？）選三杯不同風味的威士忌品嚐

調酒部分也令人驚艷！
侍酒師和服務生英文很好，能流利介紹菜單與酒種風味。","The whiskey is too good, right?
You can order triple -to -line, and you can choose three cups of different flavors of whiskey to taste from the wine list (should there be a dozen species and twenty types?)

The bartender part is also amazing!
The sommelier and waiter are very good in English, which can fluently introduce the menu and wine flavor."
"晚上大概九點左右進店、環境非常舒適、適宜下班後小聚小酌聊天，不會非常鬧騰、調酒師人都很好、講解非常詳細👍🏻
重點：調酒特調很好喝❤️

補上二訪照片：黑松露炸薯條必點！
配酒超正很脆很香下酒點心😝","At about nine o'clock in the evening, I entered the store around 9 o'clock, the environment is very comfortable, and the suitable for chatting and drinking after get off work will not be very noisy. The bartender is very good.
Key points: bartending special tone is delicious ❤️

Add two visits: Black pine dew fried fries must be ordered!

"2022/09/12
這次來訪點了餐點，食材是有用心料理過的，味道很不錯，水準之上，但份量較小。

已到訪數次。調酒的品質還是很棒。味道很有層次。定期會更新酒單與辦活動。很用心經營的店家。

非常特別的酒吧！所有的調酒都是用噶瑪蘭威士忌去調出來的。香氣以及味道的層次都很不錯！內部的座位也都很舒適。","2022/09/12
The meal was meal this time. The ingredients had been carefully dish. The taste was very good, above the standard, but the portion was small.

Has been visited several times.The quality of bartending is still great.The taste is very layered.Regularly update wine lists and activities.Stores that are very careful.

Very special bar!All bartenders are mixed out with Karmalan.The level of aroma and taste is very good!The internal seats are also very comfortable."
"謝謝店員阿琨很專業的介紹各種威士忌風味特色，讓初入門的我們可以找到喜愛的酒款，阿琨推薦的根莖脆片佐烏魚子美乃滋真的好吃😋，生日禮薯條也跟威士忌很搭，最讓人驚艷的是噶瑪蘭三重奏，馬上買了一隻回家，泥煤煙燻味也很吸引人，之後還會再回訪，整間店的氛圍都很讓人喜歡，謝謝店員各種服務跟介紹🥰，會再帶朋友回訪。

三週後再訪，點了許多調酒跟鹹食。
原本以為來威士忌酒吧的人就是喜歡威士忌才會來，如果朋友不喝威士忌就要去別的地方喝，結果我大錯特錯，這裡的調酒也太好喝！朋友通通要帶來喝！聽著店員介紹風味，再自己慢慢喝來感受味道層次變化，真的很有趣，🍹調酒類的喜歡鳳梨假期、榕樹下、李鹽冰、和平。
鹹食這次多點了餛飩、東坡肉飯，餛飩包的餡料好吃，搭上淋醬跟海苔絲，味道很搭調酒耶！東坡肉飯也很讓人驚艷，白飯特別好吃(我本來超不愛吃飯，但如果天天吃這個我很可以😂)蝦米的味道超讚，捨不得太快吃完，東坡肉本身不會柴，不過肉有點偏鹹，會想要搭更多飯吃(可能白飯太好吃，還沒吃到肉的時候已經被我吃完大半了)。
整體而言這裡的各類吃的喝的都讓人太喜歡🥰，期待下次再點些不一樣的來體驗，難得自己會有把菜單上的東西通通點一輪的想法！完全可以體會到經營者的用心、廚房的努力還有服務生的專業👍🏻👍🏻","Thank you, the clerk Ah Hun very professional introduced various whiskey flavor characteristics, so that we can find the favorite wines. The whiskey is very good. The most amazing thing is that the Karmaland triple play. I bought one home immediately. The manty smoke flavor was also very attractive. After that, I would return to visit. Thank you for the introduction of various services and introduction, and will take friends to visit again.

Visit three weeks later, ordered a lot of bartending and salty food.
People who thought that the whiskey bar would like to come to the whiskey. If a friend did not drink whiskey, he had to go to other places. As a result, I was very wrong, and the bartender here was too delicious!Friends are going to bring drinking!Listening to the shop clerk's introduction of the flavor, and then slowly drinking to feel the changes in the taste of the taste. It is really interesting. The bartender like pineapple holiday, banyan tree, Li Yanbing, and peace.
This time, I ordered the meat rice and Dongpo meat rice.Dongpo meat rice is also amazing, and the rice is particularly delicious (I originally did not like to eat, but if I eat this every day, I can eat this very much) Shrimp's taste is great. Chai, but the meat is a bit salty, and you want to eat more meals (maybe the rice is too delicious, and I have been eaten most of me when I have eaten the meat).
On the whole, all kinds of food and drink here make people like it too much. I look forward to ordering some different experiences next time. It is rare to have the idea of ​​passing things on the menu!You can fully experience the intention of the operator, the effort of the kitchen, and the professional of the waiter 👍🏻👍🏻"
"氣氛超讚的~酒也很好喝~~
大推大堆~很想再去回訪
店員也超nice，請他們推薦酒介紹的很詳細~","The atmosphere is superb ~ The wine is also delicious ~~
Push a lot ~ I want to go back to visit again
The clerk is also super nice, please recommend the introduction of wine in detail ~"
因為個人經常買Kavalan的酒自飲或送人，所以想來Bar嘗試更多不同的品項，是氣氛很好的威士忌bar，服務人員超級專業解說各種威士忌的特色，也會推薦適合的酒款，過程中也會客氣詢問是否喝的習慣喜歡，服務態度真的非常優良，下酒菜也不錯，極力推薦給喜歡威士忌的朋友,"Because individuals often buy Kavala's wine to drink or give away, I want to come to BAR to try more different items. It is a whiskey BAR with a good atmosphere. In the process, you will also be polite to ask if you like the habit of drinking. The service attitude is really good, and the vegetables are also good. I strongly recommend it to friends who like whiskey."
啤酒不錯，小貴，氣氛很好，裝潢佳，乾淨明亮，豬腳好吃，pizza不錯，服務佳，整體不錯,"Beer is good, small, the atmosphere is good, good decoration, clean and bright, pig feet are delicious, Pizza is good, good service, good overall"
好久沒來，氛圍一樣很棒，一樣坐滿滿，服務人員同樣細心又專業，兩杯還沒上市的新調酒，一輕一重都非常好喝；今天的料理酒香東坡肉好吃的亂七八糟，濃濃花生香的雙麻抄手也好吃。,"I haven't come for a long time, the atmosphere is the same, sitting is full, the service staff is also careful and professional. The two cups have not yet been listed, and they are very delicious. Today’s cooking wine is delicious. The mess, the dwarf copies of the thick peanuts are also delicious."
"進去酒吧像是密室脫逃一樣要找神秘按鈕，進去之後燈光只有酒吧以及桌上才有燈，整體偏昏暗，但是給人的感覺是放鬆乾淨舒服，不是混雜場所的感覺。
服務生介紹酒以及菜單之後也是另一個驚艷之處。兩本酒單，一本很普通就是一個菜單，另一本翻開之後是立體書，介紹店內特有的調酒。
服務生會了解一下客戶的喜好推薦酒，因為做食品調味料出身的我很害怕香料，喝了許多市面上的瓶裝水果酒中，我幾乎都是喝葡萄跟蘋果口味的水果酒，服務生有說他們都是用法國水果泥下去做的！聽到這個的我放心點我愛的水果啦～（可能是我第一次到調酒的地方喝酒。也許許多調酒的地方都是用水果泥下去我不確定～）
最後點了柚子的水果酒！
酒上來之後服務生介紹上面的泡沫是干貝的味道，第一口要大口喝～要喝到柚子酒～
本來很害怕的我還是喝喝看～結果風味意外的融合很特別！酒精濃度也不會太重很適合我。服務生很專業也都可以自然的說出成分跟口感～讓消費者可以點到適合的我覺得開心🥳
喝酒怎麼能不配炸物吃呢～有松露薯條跟宮保薯條（忘記名稱了），不喜歡松露的我點了宮保薯條～
使用13 香還有花生醬，鹹甜鹹甜的，歐買尬～是我吃過最喜歡的薯條，是早餐店美式薯條厚實的口感搭配香辛料超好吃！
整體下來第一次來這邊消費的體驗都感到滿意
酒的價格約500 食物約300元。
偶爾來一次紓壓很棒
附近也有停車場～
以後會常來～！","Going in the bar is looking for a mysterious button like a dense room. After entering, the lights only have lights and tables on the table. The overall is dark, but it feels like relaxing and comfortable, not a mixed place.
The waiter introduced the wine and the menu was another amazing feature.Two wine lists, one is very ordinary is a menu, and the other is a three -dimensional book after opening.
The waiter will understand the customer's preferences to recommend wine, because I am afraid of spices from the food seasoning. I drink a lot of bottled fruit wine on the market. I almost drink grapes and apple flavors. It is said that they are all made with French fruit puree!I can rest assured that I love the fruit I love ~ (Maybe it is the first time I have drunk the bartender. Maybe many bartending places are used to use fruit puree. I am not sure ~)
Finally ordered the fruit wine of grapefruit!
After the wine came up, the waiter introduced the bubble to the smell of scallop. Drink the first mouth ~ Drink grapefruit wine ~
I was very scared. I still drink and watch ~ The result of the unexpected fusion is very special!Alcohol concentration is not too heavy for me.The waiter is very professional and can naturally say ingredients and taste ~ Let consumers order it to be suitable. I feel happy.
How can I not eat fried in drinking ~ There are truffle potato strips and palaces buns (forgotten the name). I don’t like truffle. I ordered Gongbao French fries ~
Use 13 incense and peanut butter, salty and sweet, Eu Buying is embarrassing ~ It is the favorite fries I have ever eaten. It is the thick texture of the American fries strip of the breakfast shop with fragrant Xinxin!
I am satisfied
The price of wine is about 500 foods about 300 yuan.
Occasionally, the pressure relief is great
There are also parking lots nearby ~
I will come often in the future ~!"
"非常喜歡這間酒吧的氣氛，低調的隱身在二樓柏克金燒肉屋內、搭上舒適的裝潢，原以為可能是間嚴肅的酒吧，但完全不會，服務員和調酒師都很親切，有問題都可以輕鬆詢問😘

調酒的種類超多，除了menu上的酒款外，也可以提出自己的偏好，讓調酒師調配；調酒以外，也建議試試原桶威士忌，直接從木桶倒出威士忌是很特別的體驗呢～
（宜蘭員山金車威士忌酒廠酒吧也有了喔！）

總結：已收入台北回訪酒吧名單❤️","I like the atmosphere of this bar very much. The low -key hidden is in the second floor of the Berkkin roasted meat house with comfortable decoration. I thought it might be a serious bar, but the waiter and the bartender were very kind. If you have any questions, you can easily ask 轻

There are many types of bartending. In addition to the wine on Menu, you can also propose your own preferences to prepare the bartender. In addition to bartending, it is also recommended to try the original barrel whiskey. What about experience ~
(Yilan Mean Shanjinjie whiskey bar bar is also available!)

Summary: The list of returning to Taipei in Taipei ❤️"
"一直很愛葛瑪蘭威士忌的香氣，看到有調酒吧就想去嘗試看看。
芒果園：卡菲爾萊姆葉經過燒灼的香氣，帶出芒果的甜美,茶香 波本桶威士忌，柚子香。

李鹽冰：楊桃鳳梨 梅子香味

浪與岸：第一次喝到調酒有生蠔味，非常獨特的味道。","I have always loved the aroma of Hemalan, and I want to try it when I see a bar.
Mango Garden: After the burning aroma of Kafir Lym, brings out the sweetness of mango, tea fragrance Ben bucket whiskey, grapefruit fragrance.

Li Yanbing: Cafe pineapple plum fragrance

Waves and shore: The first drinking to bartender has a oyster flavor, which is very unique."
第一次愛上一間酒吧就是這裡了！從入口就開始，店內氣氛神秘優雅。每位服務人員都對菜單瞭解極深，酒保更不例外，各個態度非常友善、親切。菜單與飲品充滿巧思與創意，所有的酒都是酒吧獨創。熱愛Kavalan的朋友也可以品嚐店內販售的單杯限量酒，彌補之前發售沒買到的遺憾。10週年系列與畫作聯名系列都有單杯販售。極推！去了第一次後隔天馬上再訪🤣 …,"This is the first time to fall in love with a bar!Starting from the entrance, the atmosphere in the store is mysterious and elegant.Each service staff knows very deeply about the menu, and the wine insurance is no exception. Each attitude is very friendly and kind.The menu and drinks are full of ingenuity and creativity, and all wines are exclusive to the bar.Friends who love Kavala can also taste the single cup of limited wine sold in the store to make up for the regrets that have not been bought before.The 10th anniversary series and painting joint series are sold on a single cup.Push!After the first time I went to visit again the next day 🤣 ..."
環境非常乾淨優雅且安靜，不管是調酒或是原酒都非常棒！威士忌從酒桶直接取出，風味保留的非常好！重點是服務生非常的親切，教育訓練做的非常好，專業知識非常足夠。點餐的時候服務生都會向我們介紹酒的知識及調酒的內容物還有該調酒的取名由來，非常推薦給大家！,"The environment is very clean, elegant and quiet, whether it is bartending or raw wine!The whiskey is taken out directly from the barrel, and the flavor is very good!The point is that the waiter is very kind, the education and training do well, and the professional knowledge is enough.When ordering, the waiter will introduce us to the knowledge of wine and the content of bartending content, as well as the origin of the bartender. It is very recommended to everyone!"
"第一次來威士忌酒吧 店員會熱情的介紹各種酒類 這次點了兩款威士忌都很順口好喝 非常推薦大家來品嚐台灣在地的威士忌🥃

"#台北酒吧 #台北中山區

➤台北｜Kavalan Whisky Bar

🔹本次酒單：
1）老客棧/$450+10%
2）日式茶飲/$450+10%

和友人聚餐結束後，臨時決定續攤，
開啟Google Maps尋找優質酒吧時，
剛好友人曾去過，訂了位就去探險了。

隱藏在餐廳裡的Whisky Bar，
進店的方式很特別，
很像是觸動機關，來到另個神秘空間，
有種短暫與世隔絕感，
在這喝酒真的很放鬆。

酒單像是故事書的方式呈現，
店員像是說書人說故事般介紹，
酒單名為「一隅 」，
大致分為土地、文化、語言三大項，
不想喝調酒也有威士忌原桶可以選擇，
或是說說想要喝的酒感或口感來推薦。

🔹台灣的土地-老客棧The Inn
友人點的老客棧，上桌就令人驚艷，
煙霧彌漫並以茶盤方式上桌，
此杯用鐵觀音茶香為主調，
威士忌為基底，酒感略重，
但入喉後會有淡淡茶味，令人喜歡。

🔹台灣的文化-日式茶飲Japanese Sour
而我的話，因為想喝偏酸又清爽的酒，店員推薦這杯日式茶飲，
上桌時放在榻榻米的杯墊上，
有種瞬間來到日本的感覺，
以琴酒為基底的日式茶飲，
加入紫蘇葉、干貝、柚子及玄米茶，
喝起來清爽也較無酒味，
還能聞到紫蘇葉的清香，
喝個幾杯都沒問題。😆
-
跟其他間Bar比，價錢略高點，
但酒的品質、環境都很優秀，
是一間有質感的Bar，令人放鬆，
友人因為要趕車關係，只能短暫停留，
但短短時間就被這間Bar吸引，
下次有機會一定再訪，真的大推這間！

After the dinner with friends, they temporarily decided to renew the stall.
When opening Google Maps to find high -quality bars,

There is a sense of shortness from the world,
Drinking here is really relaxed.

The wine list is presented in the way the story book,
The clerk introduced the story as a storyteller.
The wine single name is ""Yilong"",
It is roughly divided into three major items of land, culture, and language.
There is also a whiskey barrel to choose from without wanting to drink alcohol.
Or say that you want to drink the wine or taste.

客 Taiwan's Land-Old Inn The inn
The old inns who are on the friends are amazing.
The smoke is filled and served as a tea tray.
This cup is based on Tieguanyin tea fragrance,
The whiskey is the base, and the wine feels slightly heavier.
But after entering the throat, there will be a touch of tea, which is loved.

Taiwan's culture-Japanese-style tea japnese sour
And my words, because I want to drink sour and refreshing wine, the clerk recommends this cup of Japanese tea,
Put on the tatami coaster when serving,
There is a feeling of coming to Japan in an instant,
Japanese -style tea based on piano wine,
Add the perilla leaves, scallops, grapefruit and mysterious rice tea,
Drink is refreshing and has no wine,
You can also smell the fragrance of perilla leaves,

剛開始接觸酒吧和學習酒文化。只來兩次，但放鬆暢聊很開心！在地風情的酒單，調酒師熱情介紹，讓人放鬆又驚喜～,"I just started to contact the bar and learn wine culture.Only twice, but relaxing and chatting very happy!In the local style wine list, the bartender introduces enthusiastically, making people relax and surprise ~"
"酒很好喝！有別於一般外面的調酒
bartender 非常專業！可以客製化客人喜歡的風味～
食物也很好吃！大推月見雙享飯！","The wine is delicious!Different from ordinary bartending outside
Bartender is very professional!You can customize the flavor that guests like ~
The food is also delicious!See Double Enjoyment Meal!"
威士忌套組自選三杯1100，很值得點，東坡肉菜飯很不錯，炒手中規中矩，以威士忌為主軸發想的調酒很細緻,"The whiskey is selected for three cups of 1100, which is worth point. Dongpo meat and rice are very good. The fried hands are quite satisfactory."
"環境舒適酒好喝！好酒喝起來舒服不會亂起酒疹。調酒都是用心設計出來的～ 結合台灣在地特色。直接喝shot能喝出格瑪蘭威士忌的香醇～
餐點也好吃！推雞肉魯肉飯以及生牛肉牛舌餅","Environment comfortable wine is delicious!Good wine is comfortable and not rash.The bartending is designed with carefully ~ combined with Taiwan's local characteristics.Drinking shot directly can drink the fragrant glory of the whiskey ~
The meal is delicious!Pushing chicken meat rice and raw beef beef tongue cake"
"氣氛很好，酒品不需多說，下酒菜都是很台味的點心，覺得很有趣很適合帶外國朋友來。
甘梅地瓜很推薦，但特製的茶油美奶滋，茶油味太搶味，油味過重（少了茶味清香），與甘梅地瓜不是太合拍～
座位除了吧台區較亮外，其他地方都過暗了，對於看菜單或看酒色、菜色都很吃力。","The atmosphere is very good. Needless to say, the wine is a very unintelligible snack. It is very interesting and suitable for bringing foreign friends.
Ganmei sweet potato is very recommended, but the special tea oil is beautiful, the tea oil taste is too grabbing, and the oil taste is too heavy (less tea flavor).
Except for the brighter seat area, the seats are too dark in other places, and they are very difficult to watch the menu or watch the wine and the dishes."
"Kavalan Whisky Bar最特別的是，在這裡可以體驗到從橡木桶內直接取出酒，直飲的驚喜享受

隨著年齡的增長愛原酒多過於調酒
有人說威士忌🥃的本質是分享也是共享

來到這邊，不僅酒好喝，連心靈都很愉悅","The most special thing about Kavalan WHISky Bar is that you can experience the surprise of directly taking out the wine from the oak barrel and enjoy the surprise

As you grow older, Aiharajiu is too much bartending
Some people say that the essence of whiskey is sharing or sharing

When you come here, not only the wine is delicious, but even the heart is very happy"
非常喜歡這裡的氛圍，店裡的服務人員非常親切，對於每道食物及調酒都會事先介紹他的風味及特色，也會針對客戶的不同需求提供最佳的建議。昨晚場地、食物跟酒都恰到好處，還有一位服務小姐非常親切的幫我解決了一個難題❤完全被圈粉了～,"I like the atmosphere here very much. The service staff in the store is very kind. For each food and bartending, he will introduce his flavor and characteristics in advance, and also provide the best suggestions for the different needs of customers.Last night, the venue, food and wine were just right, and there was a service lady very kind to help me solve a problem."
"蠻適合帶外國客人來這體驗台灣威土忌及
充滿台灣味調酒肯定是讚不絕口","It's quite suitable for bringing foreign guests to experience Taiwan's prestige and taboos and
Full of Taiwanese sake, it must be praised"
"木槿花香的「初心」與另一杯紫蘇帶干貝奶蓋的調酒真的很不錯
另外這也是想體驗葛瑪蘭威士忌前的好選擇
單杯先喝看看，喜歡再帶整瓶回家","The ""initial heart"" of the hibiscus flower fragrance and the bartending of another cup of azissal shellfish milk cover is really good
In addition, this is also a good choice to experience the before the Gemalan whiskey

威士忌吧的氣氛非常悠閒 建議點 trio flight 可一次過品嚐三種威士忌,"The atmosphere of the whiskey bar is very leisurely, it is recommended to click Trio Flight to taste three types of whiskey at a time"
整體來說還不錯，無論是原酒還是調酒都很好喝。但不知道是不是問太多問題，店員漸漸顯得不耐煩🤷🏻‍♀️,"Overall is pretty good, whether it is raw wine or bartending.But I don’t know if I asked too many questions, the clerk gradually seemed impatient 🤷🏻‍♀️"
餐點很好吃調酒師的調酒技術也是一流的餐廳氛圍好服務生的顏值都很高是會想在二訪❤️,"The meal is very delicious, and the bartending technology of the winemaker is also a first -class restaurant atmosphere. The waiter is very high."
對於初次入門威士忌的我，很親切的說明不同威士忌的差異跟推薦，藏身在燒肉店真的很特別，安靜昏暗，心靈有沈澱的感覺，不得不說噶瑪蘭不只威士忌，琴酒也是很有特色，藥草味上疊加上水果味，調酒師的Gin fizz也很有水準,"For the initial entry -level whiskey, I very kindly explained the differences and recommendations of different whiskey. It is really special to hide in a roasted meat shop, quiet and dim, and feel the soul. It has characteristics, the smell of the herbs is superimposed, and the Gin FIZZ of the bartender is also very standard"
"精緻舒服的威士忌酒吧，
環境跟用具都很有質感，
人也不多也不用吼叫聊天，
調酒很有台灣特色很特別，
會願意再訪💪","Exquisite and comfortable whiskey bar,
The environment and utensils are very textured,
There are not many people and do not have to roar to chat.
Bart -up is very special in Taiwan.
Will be willing to visit again"
昨日去用餐，吃到一半發現包包裡的飲料漏出來，所以我把包包裡的東西拿出來然後擦拭包包內吧。結果店員發現我在擦包包，很主動地拿超級吸水的擦手紙過來給我，真的很感動，謝謝店員的貼心！,"I went to dinner yesterday and I found that the drinks in the bag were leaked out, so I took out the things in the bag and wiped the bag.As a result, the clerk found that I was rubbing the bag and took the super absorbent paper to me. It was really touched. Thank you for your thoughtfulness!"
很棒的體驗，會耐心細心分析客人喜好製作調酒，環境舒適餐點好吃😋服務我們的Bryan超專業讚👍，每一款調酒都很喜歡，會再回訪的！,"A great experience, I will patiently analyze the guests' preferences to make bartender. The environment is comfortable and delicious. We serve our Bryan super professional praise. Every bartender likes it."
"很不錯的酒吧，蠻暗的
氣氛很好，沙發很舒服

Bartender 很細心介紹調酒
Menu 蠻特別的，打開是像花瓣一樣盛開
但老實說有點不好讀懂
第一杯喝的百香果相關的調酒
真的不是太好喝

後來換回 Old Fashioned 表現不錯
推薦可以來坐坐喝酒聊天","Very good bar, it's quite dark
The atmosphere is very good, the sofa is very comfortable

Bartender introduced bartending carefully
Menu is quite special, opening is blooming like petals

It's a pity ~~
Before changing the menu, I found a friend to eat the upcoming menu for a round
So satisfied 😆😆
Everything is delicious 都 好 都 都 都

Looking forward to the new menu in November!"
應該是用來Demo葛瑪蘭威士忌的一家調酒吧，但口味很不錯，菜單的設計也頗具新意，非酒精類的果汁也做得非常好喝，就是作為酒館好像打烊的有點太早了。,"It should be a bartending bar used to Demo Gemalan whiskey, but the taste is very good. The design of the menu is quite new. Non -alcoholic juice is also very delicious, that is, it seems that it is a bit too early as a tavern."
空間很寬敞又寧靜🥃✨這次喝的這兩杯還不錯👌第二杯夜空是很特別，上面有滿滿的黑芝麻泡，味道很濃郁😘 …,The space is very spacious and quiet 🥃✨ The two cups that drink this time are pretty good. The second cup of night sky is very special. There are full of black sesame soaked on it.

環境很優雅且舒適，酒保跟服務生服務都很專業且到位,"The environment is very elegant and comfortable, and the wine insurance and waiter services are very professional and in place"
我並沒有特別喜歡噶瑪蘭的威士忌，但是這真的是一個很棒的威士忌酒吧，噶瑪蘭的原酒種類多，且店內也相當舒服，唯獨沙發座坐姿有點高，比較不放鬆，另外，如果可以提供一個小小的下酒點心，可能會讓人更開心,"I don't particularly like Karmaland's whiskey, but this is really a great whiskey bar. There are many types of wine in Karmaland, and the store is quite comfortable. If you can provide a small wine snack, it may make people happier"

It is a very atmospheric bar
The entrance design is clever

There are many specialty bartender at the scene
What attracts me the most is that there are oak barrels on the scene to take the original wine directly

"調酒；
松樹下 沒什麼酒感  綠茶+果汁的感覺
甘草芭樂 一樣沒酒感
Whiskey okay,但太辛辣","Bartending;
There is no wine feeling green tea+juice under the pine tree
Licorice Bara feels like wine
Whiskey okay, but too spicy"
意外地發現一個隱身在大樓內的好去處！每位Bartender 都能對自家調酒侃侃而談，專業地向我們介紹適合的調酒。調酒很精緻，服務也很好。會是以後想要常來的地方😊若說唯一需要再更棒的地方，可能就是在店內的音樂挑選上與店內裝潢或是vibes需要在挑選一下，因為當時店內音樂較多都是pop music，有些許格格不入。,"I accidentally found a good place to be hidden in the building!Each Bartender can talk to his own drowing and professionalism to introduce us to the suitable bartender.The bartender is exquisite and the service is also very good.It will be a place where you want to come often. If you say that the only thing that needs to be better is, it may be that the music selection in the store and the interior decoration of the store or Vibes need to be selected, because at that time, there were more music in the store. Some are incompatible."

值得一訪再訪。","In terms of whiskey brand, the standard is very high. Even compared with other bars, it is not inferior to it, and the environment is secretive and comfortable.

It is worth visiting again."
"很喜歡這邊的氣氛，很放鬆
他們的調酒menu是立體書，看起來很精緻又有趣😍
我點的是屏東的調酒，有椰子、可可的味道，喝起來甜甜的，很符合當天的期待～
會回訪😊👍🏻 …","I really like the atmosphere here, very relaxed

酒吧地點隱密、服務態度佳、介紹酒品時專業度高、調酒極具台灣特色,"Bar location is hidden, good service attitude, high professionalism when introducing wines, and alcoholic bartending very Taiwanese characteristics"
看到評分很高所以跟朋友一起來，到二樓燒肉店店員請我們按開關進去酒吧，第一眼覺得氣氛很好，看起來位置還很多，結果走來一個服務生問我們幾位，我回答兩位，結果服務生竟然叫我們出去門外等，然後過一陣子都沒人來，是等到有別組客人開門，其他的服務生看到我們在外面等，才過來問是不是要進酒吧喝酒，相當的傻眼🙄感覺很不被尊重,"I saw the scoring very high, so I came with my friends. At the second floor, the shop clerk asked us to press the switch to the bar. At first glance, I felt that the atmosphere was good. It seemed that there was still a lot of position. As a result, one waiter asked us a few. I answered the two, but the waiter told us to go out outside the door, and then no one came for a while. It was until the door of the different groups opened the door. The other waiters saw us outside and waited. I went to the bar to drink, and I felt quite dumbfounded. I felt very disrespectful"
"點了5杯酒飲
4個飯及煎餃和小菜
比起前次覺得雖是熟門熟路的客人但失望多過驚讚！","Ordered 5 glasses of drinking

酒單用立體圖片呈現 配上店員詳細的解說 非常可愛 調酒也很棒,The wine list is presented with a three -dimensional picture with the detailed explanation of the clerk.
進店記得點旁邊的台灣標誌才會開門，餐點好好吃！酒也好棒！不小心喝多了，希望我能平安到家。不小心就待了兩小時,"When you enter the store, the Taiwan logo next to you will open the door, and the meal is delicious!Wine is also great!I accidentally drink too much, I hope I can get home safely.Stay for two hours by accident"

"松江南京一站一帶在南京東路接鄰新生高架橋的這處、位在執行署同一棟樓的自家燒肉餐廳裡，一個暗門的滑開藏身在內的酒吧讓人覺得驚奇感十足；穿過排列連續的酒桶、不時穿插著綠色植栽和典雅擺飾的內裝使人感受在質感備至以外也享受著恬靜感；平日位子仍算充足，不過仍是透過線上訂位會比較保險一點。
除了自家釀製的各式招牌威士忌品項外，一系列的台式意象特殊調酒也是訪客必點的項目之一，諸如李塩冰、新娘茶等從外觀上就引起十足好奇感也給人特殊風味誠意口感的酒類都讓氣氛營造的更是到位。","This area of ​​the one -stop area of ​​Nanjing, Songjiang is adjacent to the new viaduct, is located in its own roasted meat restaurant in the same building in the Executive Office. After the arranged continuous wine barrels, from time to time, the interior of green planting and elegant decorations makes people feel the sense of tranquility in the outside of the texture; a little.
In addition to all kinds of signature whiskey products brewed, a series of desktop psychic special bartending is also one of the must -order items for visitors. For example The wine with a sincere and sincere taste has made the atmosphere more in place."
謝謝店員阿琨細心的介紹每種酒，讓我們每個人都可以喝到自己很喜歡的酒，來之前還很怕我朋友會不會不能接受因為她不喝威士忌，可是來了她喝得很開心！很推薦的地方,"Thank you, the clerk Ah Kun introduced each wine carefully, so that each of us can drink the wine that we like very much. Before you came, I was afraid that my friend would accept whether she would not drink whiskey because she did not drink whiskey, but when she came, she drank very well happy!Recommended place"
舒適的環境，別具特色的噶瑪蘭！,"A comfortable environment, unique Karmalan!"
"人生最愛的茶調酒沒有之一
茶味跟酒味平衡的非常驚艷！！
山川首席波特風味 、佛手柑、桂花 加上一斤要7k的鐵觀音(店員說的)，還用帶著檀香加乾冰來模擬指南宮裊裊的香火。
他的調酒的酒單也是有夠浮誇，透過立體紙雕表現大約有15杯左右的調酒，真是辛苦幫我們介紹的Sinsia了。
------以上為嘴砲的部分------
這杯從香氣到口感的層次都很協調，香氣上從剛剛上桌時飽滿的鐵觀音茶香以及尾端點綴淡淡的威士忌蜜香與酒感，隨著溫度的上升香氣更為豐富在茶香後慢慢帶出柑橘以及桂花的甜香；更有趣的是，口感上的風味則與聞香完全相反，是從威士忌略帶木質的調性以及桂花蜜甜味開始，過渡到微微茶感的苦澀最為收口，真的是一不小心就會一口乾掉的調酒。
附上威士忌套酒品飲筆記
fino雪莉桶：
檸檬香，左帶著豆漿以及焦糖的風味
葡萄酒桶：(我目前最愛的一款噶瑪蘭
葡萄的那種葡萄乾的風味超明顯。
泥煤桶：
一開始有泥煤的香氣，放久一點還好，反而帶出更多的蜜糖甜感，意外的好喝！！
228再訪
木槿花調性那杯「初心」非常好喝，適合害怕酒精感的人，像是帶花香的果汁。
另外這次終於下決心點了一杯PX雪莉桶威士忌以及獲得世界冠軍的那隻杯Amontillado威士忌。
PX：前段十分纖細帶點香水檸檬的香氣，白花香以及蜜香，尾段像是蜂蜜一樣非常甜。
世界冠軍威士忌：很標準的一隻酒，該有的味道都有，也是一杯滿分的作品(但反著說就少了個性。
ps這家調酒其他幾款，我個人也覺得不錯，他們家的酒完成度都蠻高的，但最愛的還是這杯貓空指南宮。
pps 宮保薯條味道很妙，反而帶點甜味，附上的也是甜味花生醬，嗜甜者可以考慮，其他人勸退。","There is no one of the favorite tea bartender in life
Tea flavor and wine flavor are very stunning!Intersection
The chief Potter flavor, bergamot, osmanthus, and a pound of Tieguanyin (said by the clerk) with a pound of osmanthus, and also used sandalwood and dry ice to simulate the incense of the guidance palace.
His bartending wine list is also exaggerated enough. It shows about 15 cups of bartending through three -dimensional paper carving. It is really hard to help us introduce SINSIA.
------ The above is the part of the mouth gun -------
This cup is very coordinated from the level of aroma to taste. The aroma is full of Tieguanyin tea fragrance and a faint whiskey honey fragrance and wine feeling from the end of the table. Later, slowly bring out the sweet fragrance of citrus and osmanthus; more interesting is that the flavor of the taste is completely opposite to smelling incense. It starts with the slightly wooden tone of whiskey and the sweetness of osmanthus honey. The bitterness is the most close, and it is really a bartender that will be dried in one bite.

FINO Shirley bucket:
The flavor of lemon, the flavor of soy milk and caramel
Wine barrel: (My current favorite Karmalan
The flavor of the grapes is super obvious.
Porta barrel:

Hibiscus flower tune the ""initial heart"" is very delicious, suitable for people who are afraid of alcohol, like juice with flower fragrance.
In addition, this time I finally decided to order a cup of PX Shirley bucket whiskey and the cup of AMONTILADO whiskey who won the world champion.
PX: The aroma of the lemon in the front section is very slim, the white flower aroma and the honey fragrance, the rear section is as sweet as honey.
World Champion whiskey: A very standard wine, which should have a taste, and a full -scale work (but there is less personality.
PS, this alcohol, I personally think it is good. The completion of their wines is quite high, but the favorite is the Cat Air Guide Palace.
PPS Palace Payon Bao French fries have a wonderful flavor, but have a sweet taste, and they are also sweet peanut butter. Sweet -loving people can consider that others are dismissed."

It is a great place for people who do not understand wine tasting. The waiter will explain it in detail. I drink a lot of delicious and different Shirley barrels.

台北的噶瑪蘭威士忌吧是台灣著名品牌的隱藏的瑰寶。不難找到，但確實有一點神秘的感覺——你必須上一層，進入燒烤餐廳，向左走，按牆上唯一的按鈕，門就會自動打開。我和我的朋友們是星期一去的，所以那裡並不擁擠，但我們當地的朋友告訴我們，週末這裡通常會客滿。我們享用了一些優質的威士忌和創意雞尾酒，搭配了一些美味的菜餚。這次體驗是獨一無二的，絕對值得！,"The Karmalan whiskey in Taipei is a hidden treasure of Taiwan's famous brand.It is not difficult to find, but it really feels a little mysterious -you have to go to the next floor, enter the barbecue restaurant, go left, and press the only button on the wall, the door will automatically open.My friends and I went on Monday, so it was not crowded there, but our local friends told us that we are usually full here on weekends.We enjoyed some high -quality whiskey and creative cocktails, with some delicious dishes.This experience is unique, it is definitely worth it!"
"這是一家時尚的megamax商店。威士忌愛好者絕對應該來。
進入大樓二樓的烤肉餐廳，從左側看起來像威士忌桶的東西進入。按下台灣形狀的按鈕進店很時尚。
工作人員的英語非常流利，並詳細解釋了所有菜單項目。由於我的英語能力很差，很難聽懂我所聽到的內容，但他們給了我一本威士忌口味的小冊子，所以我不用擔心！服務也非常好，他們總是確保我玩得很開心。如果你不知道該喝什麼，可以向工作人員詢問推薦的菜單。我點了一套三種稍微好一點的威士忌。
我個人比較喜歡泥煤的味道，但感覺和噶瑪蘭的味道不太相符，可能是台灣本土特色的緣故吧。如果你喜歡蘇格蘭威士忌，你可以在便利商店買格蘭菲迪，但最好在這裡點雪莉桶之類的東西！
不過，如果你喜歡噶瑪蘭，我想無論點什麼你都會滿意的。
如果你喜歡威士忌，你絕對應該過來！還有一個計數器，看來你可以單獨使用它！","This is a fashionable Megamax store.Whiskey lovers should definitely come.
Enter the barbecue restaurant on the second floor of the building, and it looks like a whiskey barrel from the left.The button that presses the shape of Taiwan is very fashionable to enter the store.
The staff's English is very fluent and explains all the menu items in detail.Because my English ability is very poor, it is difficult to understand what I heard, but they gave me a Book of whiskey flavors, so I don't have to worry!The service is also very good, they always make sure I have fun.If you don't know what to drink, you can ask the staff to ask the recommended menu.I ordered a set of three slightly better whiskey.
I personally prefer the taste of mud, but it feels that it is not consistent with the taste of Karmaland. It may be because of the local characteristics of Taiwan.If you like Scottish whiskey, you can buy Grafdi in a convenience store, but it is best to order things like Shirley buckets here!
However, if you like Karmaland, I think you will be satisfied no matter what you order.
If you like whiskey, you should definitely come over!There is also a counter, it seems that you can use it alone!"
"我是平日晚上去的，沒有預約，但不用等，座位也很多！工作人員都很友好，價格定為一人 700 多美元，兩人 1,400 美元。
我點了一份噶瑪蘭三件組和一杯雞尾酒，我覺得三件套比點一杯更划算！
雞尾酒不適合我的口味，但他們一直問我好不好，當我說不好的時候，他們就仔細地問我喜歡什麼風格，然後就相應地改變了。非常感謝...♡
工作人員都很友善，氣氛很棒，即使是不喜歡喝酒的人也會感覺很好，我想這將是您台灣之旅至少順便來一次的好地方！","I went on weekdays and did not make an appointment, but I did n’t have to wait. There are many seats!The staff are very friendly, the price is set to more than $ 700 per person, and the two are $ 1,400.
I ordered a three -piece Karmalan group and a cup of cocktails. I think the three -piece set is more cost -effective than ordering a cup!
Cocktail is not suitable for my taste, but they always ask me if it is good. When I say it is not good, they carefully ask me what style I like, and then change it accordingly.Thank you very much ... ♡
The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is great. Even those who don't like drinking will feel good. I think this will be a good place for your trip to Taiwan at least once!"
"氣氛和裝飾真的很棒。那種隱藏門很酷。  如果您還沒有嘗試過台灣加瓦蘭威士忌，那麼這將是品嚐它們的好方法。這不是蘇格蘭風格的威士忌。期待更深色、更重的味道。如果你不是威士忌愛好者，我不會推薦它。
也偏貴。因此，也許可以共享一次品嚐航班並享用一些小吃，因為食物價格過高。","The atmosphere and decoration are really great.The hidden door is cool.If you have not tried Taiwan Garvaran whiskey, then this will be a good way to taste them.This is not a Scottish style whiskey.Looking forward to a darker and heavier taste.If you are not whiskey lovers, I will not recommend it.
It's also expensive.Therefore, it may be possible to share a flight and enjoy some snacks, because the price of food is too high."
"身為一個噶瑪蘭威士忌的粉絲，自2010年以來第一次來到台北，去噶瑪蘭威士忌吧就像一次朝聖。壓力進入地下酒吧的台灣形按鈕。

燈光非常引人注目，只有夢幻般的酒吧和酒桶被針燈照亮。  我們很快就坐在角落。  我無意中聽到其他顧客說多種語言，從日語到韓語。

我從精心設計的菜單中嘗試了幾款雞尾酒。  一杯雞尾酒端上來時，托盤冒出一層霧氣。  我還購買了僅在釀酒廠或威士忌酒吧出售的特殊珍藏桶威士忌。

我依稀記得鹹味的開胃菜還不錯。  芋頭和地瓜片，配上美味的辣蛋黃醬。  如果您是噶瑪蘭的粉絲，那麼到台北旅行絕對不能錯過噶瑪蘭威士忌吧。","As a fan of Karmalan whiskey, he came to Taipei for the first time since 2010. It is like a pilgrimage to Karmaland whiskey.Stress enter the Taiwan -shaped button of the underground bar.

The lights are very eye -catching, only dreamy bars and barrels are illuminated by needle lights.We soon sat in the corner.I accidentally heard other customers speak a variety of languages, from Japanese to Korean.

I tried several cocktails from the carefully designed menu.When a cup of cocktails came up, a layer of mist appeared on the tray.I also bought a special treasure bucket whiskey sold in the brewing or whiskey bar.

I vaguely remember that the appetizer of salty taste is not bad.Taro and sweet potato slices with delicious spicy egg yolk sauce.If you are a fan of Karmaland, you must not miss the Karmaland whiskey when you travel in Taipei."
"噶瑪蘭威士忌吧有限量版酒桶可以品嚐（3種波爾多酒桶，泥煤酒）此外，還有各式噶瑪蘭威士忌，以噶瑪蘭威士忌為基底調製的雞尾酒，非雞尾酒，還有季節性的。
我嘗試了 6 個限量版（3 個中的 LT），它們都很美味，符合我的標準。雖然花了點錢，但…哈哈
這裡的食物對於酒吧食物的價格來說很不錯，而且很適合配菜（因為我不挑剔）。
負責的工作人員英語說得很好，很友善地推薦並解釋了我想推薦的順序，但我不能問他的名字（一個右臂有紋身的男人）。","Karmalan whiskey bar can taste (3 types of Bordeaux barrels, mud wine), in addition, there are all kinds of karmaland whiskey, cocktails formed by Karmaland whiskey, non -cocktails, and there are also Seasonal.
I tried 6 limited editions (LT in 3 of 3), which were delicious and met my standards.Although it took some money, but ... haha
The food here is very good for the price of bar food, and it is very suitable for side dishes (because I am not picky).
The responsible staff of the staff speaks very well, it is friendly to recommend and explain the order I want to recommend, but I can't ask his name (a man with a tattoo on his right arm)."
"這是威士忌愛好者必去的餐廳，也是非威士忌愛好者在台北必去的餐廳之一，提供豐富的雞尾酒菜單。
我認為進入商店的方式是讓人興奮的好方法。
附近有一家直營店可以購買噶瑪蘭威士忌，所以建議您在來之前先在這家酒吧找到您最喜歡的威士忌！","This is a restaurant for whiskey enthusiasts and one of the restaurants that non -whiskey enthusiasts must go in Taipei. They provide rich cocktail menus.
I think the way to enter the store is a good way to make people exciting.
There is a direct store nearby to buy Karmaland whiskey, so I suggest you find your favorite whiskey in this bar before you come!"
飲料和食物都很棒！如果你喜歡威士忌，來台北一定要去。所有的服務人員都很友善。雞尾酒裡的酒精濃度比平常強烈一些，所以不喜歡喝酒的人點的時候要小心。,"Drinks and food are great!If you like whiskey, you must go to Taipei.All service staff are friendly.The concentration of alcohol in cocktails is stronger than usual, so be careful when people who don't like drinking."
雖然我不太喜歡威士忌，但我覺得我必須去台灣，因為那裡是噶瑪蘭威士忌的原產地。我抱有很高的期望，因為四處閒逛尋找入口似乎會很有趣，因為這是一個 Spiky Easy Bar 的概念，但我乘坐電梯的酒吧工作人員先打開了門，這極大地破壞了樂趣。週末每人最低訂購量約700台幣。反正每人點一份飲料和一份配菜的話，很快就能吃完，所以問題不大。訂購不同的威士忌並進行比較很有趣。服務生給了我很多解釋，但我對威士忌了解不多，所以我請他推薦一款最受歡迎、最受歡迎的一款，結果我很滿意！我覺得對於喜歡威士忌的人來會比較好，不過對於我這種不太了解的人來體驗一下也是一個好地方。,"Although I don't like whiskey very much, I think I must go to Taiwan because it is the place of origin of the Karmaland whiskey.I have high expectations, because it seems interesting to find the entrance around, because this is the concept of Spiky Easy Bar, but the bar staff on the bar I took open the door first, which greatly destroyed the fun.The minimum order volume per person on weekends is about 700 Taiwan dollars.Anyway, you can eat a drink and a side dish, so you can finish it soon, so the problem is not big.It is more interesting to order different whiskey.The waiter gave me a lot of explanations, but I didn't know much about whiskey, so I asked him to recommend one of the most popular and popular one. As a result, I am very satisfied!I think it would be better for people who like whiskey, but it is also a good place to experience people like me who don't know much about it."
"一進二樓的烤肉店，左邊門外就有一個隱藏的酒吧。
按下台灣島的形狀即可打開門。
當然，酒只是噶瑪蘭。
雞尾酒也將以噶瑪蘭為基礎。
您可以品嚐到釀酒廠限定的威士忌或直接用桶子釀造的威士忌。
由於日本遊客較多，所以有簡單的補充日文菜單，酒保也會說英語。
由於是噶瑪蘭，這裡的價格有點貴，但酒精愛好者絕對應該來這裡作為旅行的紀念品。","As soon as you enter the barbecue shop on the second floor, there is a hidden bar outside the left door.
Press the shape of Taiwan Island to open the door.
Of course, wine is just Karmaland.
Cocktails will also be based on Karmaland.
You can taste the whiskey limited to the brewing or the whiskey brewed directly with a barrel.
Because there are many Japanese tourists, there are simple Japanese menu, and wine insurance can speak English.
Because it is Karmaland, the price here is a bit expensive, but alcohol enthusiasts should definitely come here as a souvenir for travel."
音樂會結束後的深夜 - 各種 Kavalan 威士忌選擇 - 以及創意混合飲料和創意美食菜餚。  我最喜歡的是宮博薯條（薯片）加糖塗層，然後沾滿花生醬。  不是你平常吃的薯條。  對威士忌的一個很好的讚美。  最低消費請提前詢問。  台灣體驗的推薦部分,"Late night after the concert -various Kavalan whiskey selection -and creative hybrid beverages and creative food dishes.My favorite is Gongbo French fries (potato chips) and sugar coating, and then covered with peanut butter.It's not the fries you usually eat.A good praise for whiskey.For the minimum consumption, please ask in advance.Recommended part of Taiwan experience"
"「KAVALAN 威士忌吧」位於大樓二樓，毗鄰同類型的烤肉店。
我沒有預約，但我能夠在正確的時間立即進入。之後很快就人滿為患，有時排隊的人超過10人，所以如果可以的話最好提前預訂。 （可以上網預約，不懂語言也沒關係。）
按下旁邊的台灣島形按鈕即可打開桶形大門。
我們進去吧！

店內光線較暗，有吧台和吧台，所以有很多桌位，氣氛非常好。

當我查看威士忌清單時，我發現大部分都是可以在商店購買的KAVALAN系列，但也有酒吧專用的陣容，這引起了我的興趣。
這次我主動點了「KAVALAN Soloist 波爾多酒桶（拉圖酒莊）（700元幣）」。
然後，一名工作人員拿著一個玻璃杯來到我的座位上，問我是否願意過來觀看他從桶子中倒酒的過程。和。
當我跟著他們時，他們開始從排列整齊的許多桶中倒出。這是一場快樂的表演。

當我回到座位上檢查顏色和香氣時，我發現它的顏色很深。因為是在台灣炎熱潮濕的氣候下製造的，據說桶內的顏色和香氣很容易轉移，但事實確實如此。
雖然沒有註明年份，但酒廠只開業了18年，所以我猜酒之所以有這樣的色香味來自於氣候。
口感順滑，略帶泥炭味。具有杏仁和漿果的香氣，並帶有輕微的澀味，更能襯托出葡萄酒的特性。

我很喜歡「松露口味炸薯條（240新台幣）」作為零食。
這是一家餐飲酒吧，所以有很多像樣的食物，所以氣氛並不安靜，但在購買一瓶並享受限量版威士忌之前，它是一個品嚐的好地方。
我每次來台北都想來這裡。","""Kavalan Whiskey Bar"" is located on the second floor of the building, adjacent to the same type of barbecue restaurant.
I have no appointment, but I can enter immediately at the right time.After that, people were full of people, and sometimes more than 10 people lined up, so it is best to book in advance if possible.(You can make an appointment online, it doesn't matter if you don't understand the language.)
Press the Taiwanese island -shaped button next to the barrel -shaped door.
Let's go in!

The light in the shop is darker. There are bar and bar tables, so there are many tables, and the atmosphere is very good.

When I checked the whiskey list, I found that most of them were the Kavalan series that could be purchased in the store, but there were also lineups for bars, which caused my interest.
This time I took the initiative to click ""Kavalan Soloist Bordeaux (Latu Winery) (Rato)"" (700 yuan).
Then, a staff member took a glass to my seat and asked if I would come to watch the process of pouring wine from the barrel.and.
When I followed them, they began to pour out from many neatly arranged barrels.This is a happy performance.

When I returned to the seat to check the color and aroma, I found that its color was darker.Because it was manufactured under the humid climate of Taiwan, it is said that the color and aroma in the barrel are easily transferred, but it is true.
Although there is no year, the winery has only been opened for 18 years, so I guess the reason why wine has such a color and fragrance comes from the climate.
The taste is smooth and slightly peat.It has the aroma of almonds and berries and a slight astringent taste, which can better set off the characteristics of wine.

I like ""French French fries (NT $ 240)"" as snacks.
This is a catering bar, so there are many decent foods, so the atmosphere is not quiet, but it is a good place to taste before buying a bottle and enjoying a limited edition whiskey.
I want to come here every time I come to Taipei."
"每人700NT為強制使用金額。
我認為預約是個好主意。
能夠嘗試各種類型的卡巴蘭真是太好了。
氣氛也很奢華。
我不知道，因為我沒有點餐。","700NT per person is forced to use.
I think making an appointment is a good idea.
It's great to be able to try various types of Kabalan.
The atmosphere is also luxurious.
I don't know, because I don't have order."
"來自台灣的單一麥芽威士忌。
最小 700mm 亞馬遜 10,000 日元
在台灣我敢一個人去酒吧，即使在日本也有點難進去。
當我小心翼翼地走進大樓的二樓時，裡面出奇的熱鬧。
而且日本人也很多。
他詳細地解釋了一切，所以即使你一個人也可以放鬆地享受威士忌。食物也很豐富。
刨冰的方式很漂亮。
裡面加了很多威士忌，喝兩杯就喝醉了。
如果匯率好的話也就不到1000日元，所以並沒有那麼貴。","Single malt whiskey from Taiwan.
Minimum 700mm Amazon 10,000 yen
I dare to go to the bar alone in Taiwan, even in Japan, it is a bit difficult to enter.
When I walked into the second floor of the building carefully, I was surprisingly lively.
And there are many Japanese.
He explained everything in detail, so even if you alone can relax whiskey.Food is also very rich.
The method of planing ice is very beautiful.
A lot of whiskey was added inside, and I was drunk after drinking two glasses.
If the exchange rate is good, it will be less than 1,000 yen, so it is not so expensive."
聽說台灣也有很發達的酒吧文化，這是一次很好的體驗，因為在那裡你可以直接品嚐來自產地的噶瑪蘭威士忌，所有的員工似乎都能說流利的英語，而且他們的英語也很流利。如果你喜歡的話。,"I heard that Taiwan also has a very developed bar culture. This is a good experience, because you can directly taste the Karmaland whiskey from the place of production. All employees seem to speak fluent English, and their English is also very fluent.If you like it."
氣氛很棒，這是一個真正的臥底酒吧，你以為你走進一家休閒餐廳，但在餐廳後面經過一扇特殊的門就是卡瓦蘭威士忌酒吧，這根本不僅僅是一個休閒酒吧。這是一家非常優雅時尚的酒吧。他們以合理的價格提供真正的單一麥芽威士忌。但最重要的是，服務很棒，這裡的工作人員對他們提供的威士忌和雞尾酒有很多了解，他們也非常友好，如果你願意的話，他們會和你聊天。我忘記了我的夾克，但他們為我保留了它，我可以在第二天取走它，甚至為我提供了一杯免費的威士忌，只是因為「信仰」讓我再次回到他們的酒吧。,"The atmosphere is great. This is a real undercover bar. You think you walked into a casual restaurant, but a special door passed behind the restaurant is the Kavan whiskey bar. This is not just a casual bar.This is a very elegant and stylish bar.They provide real single malt whiskey at reasonable prices.But the most important thing is that the service is great. The staff here have a lot of understanding of the whiskey and cocktails they provide. They are also very friendly. If you want, they will chat with you.I forgot my jacket, but they kept it for me. I could take it away the next day, and even provided me with a cup of free whiskey, just because ""faith"" made me return to their bar again."
"點心：起司薩拉米 - 煙燻起司與輕威士忌非常相配！

服務：女員工有點不友善 / 男員工英文太快
調酒師請常加水。

氣氛：秘密俱樂部的入口很獨特。
天黑了，很適合喝酒。

推薦給喜歡威士忌的人！","Dim Slim: Cheese Salami -Smart Cheese is very matched with light whiskey!

Service: Female employees are a bit unfriendly / male employees are too fast in English
Please add water often.

Atmosphere: The entrance of the Secret Club is unique.
It's dark, it is very suitable for drinking.

Recommend to those who like whiskey!"
"我們是自發性前來的顧客，無需事先預約。事實證明，找到建築物是一項極具吸引力的挑戰，但當我們發現了那座不起眼的街角建築並登上樓梯後，我們就知道我們走在正確的道路上。這家威士忌酒吧是我在全球旅行中遇到的最好的威士忌酒吧之一，而且我在這段時間裡探索過不少酒吧。

氛圍、情緒、裝飾和細心的員工無縫地結合在一起，營造出無可挑剔的和諧氛圍。我衷心推薦享受威士忌飛行三重奏體驗；無論您選擇觀看技術精湛的工作人員倒酒還是親自掌控，這都是一場引人入勝的表演。工作人員對威士忌的淵博知識在他們細緻地闡述其複雜的香氣時展現得淋漓盡致。

當晚會接近尾聲時，我發現自己印象深刻，於是我買了一瓶在家品嚐——我推薦 300 毫升泥煤口味版本，特別是如果你和我一樣喜歡的話。對我和我的妻子來說，這是一個難忘的夜晚，一個將留在我記憶中的夜晚，我熱切地希望有一天能回來重溫它的魔力。","We are the customers who come spontaneously and do not need to make an appointment in advance.It turns out that finding a building is a very attractive challenge, but when we discovered the humble street corner building and boarded the stairs, we knew that we were walking on the right road.This whiskey bar is one of the best whiskey bars I have encountered in the world, and I have explored a lot of bars during this time.

The atmosphere, emotion, decoration and careful employees are seamlessly combined to create an impeccable harmonious atmosphere.I sincerely recommend enjoying the triple experience of the whiskey flight; whether you choose to watch the superb staff of the technology or control it yourself, this is a fascinating performance.The staff's knowledge about whiskey shows its complicated aroma in detail.

When I was close to the end of the night, I found myself impressed, so I bought a bottle at home to taste -I recommend 300 ml of mud flavored version, especially if you like it like me.For me and my wife, this is an unforgettable night. A night when I will stay in my memory, I eagerly hope that one day I can come back to relive its magic."
"以低廉的價格享受您一直想吃的卡巴蘭。

友善且會說英語的工作人員讓您保持愉快的心情。","Enjoy Kabalan you always want to eat at a low price.

Friendly and speak English staff to keep you happy."
"跳過釀酒廠。如果您在台北，但沒有時間去釀酒廠觀看釀酒過程和/或混合和混合自己的威士忌，那麼只需透過他們的台北地下酒吧體驗噶瑪蘭。

我們讓我在台北的表弟幫我們預訂，因為他們似乎需要當地的電話號碼來確認預訂。威士忌酒吧早上 7 點開門。它位於牛肉餐廳內部。  秘密入口是台灣島門開關（見影片），感覺很神秘。等待牛肉餐廳的其他客人對我們對秘密入口的了解感到驚訝。噢噢！

等了一會兒後，我們比預訂的晚上 730 點更早入座了。

路易斯，我們的服務員非常出色：他解釋了所提供的產品並提出了他的個人建議，這非常有幫助。","Skip over the brewry.If you are in Taipei, but you do n’t have time to watch the brewing process and/or mix and mix your own whiskey, you only need to experience Karmaland through their Taipei underground bar.

We asked my cousin in Taipei to book for us, because they seemed to need a local phone number to confirm the booking.The whiskey bar opened at 7 am.It is located inside the beef restaurant.The secret entrance is the Taiwan island door switch (see the video), which feels mysterious.Waiting for other guests in the beef restaurant to be surprised by our understanding of the secret entrance.Oh!

After waiting for a while, we took the seat earlier than 730 pm.

Louis, our waiter is very good: he explained the products provided and put forward his personal suggestions, which is very helpful."
喜歡這裡的氣氛和所有的裝飾。玉米麵包薯條比松露薯條好得多。起司盤不錯。雞尾酒有很多品種，味道真的很好，但服務不太令人滿意，因為女僕脾氣暴躁。,"Like the atmosphere here and all decorations.Corn bread fries are much better than truffle potato strips.The cheese is good.There are many varieties of cocktails, and the taste is really good, but the service is not satisfactory because the maid is irritable."
"短髮女員工態度不友善。
我一進來就感到不安，但其他工作人員都很友好和友善。很高興能夠品嚐不同類型的噶瑪蘭威士忌。 3人花費約12萬韓元。氣氛很好^^","Short -haired female employees are not friendly.
As soon as I came in, I felt uneasy, but other staff members were friendly and friendly.I am glad to taste different types of Karmaland whiskey.3 people spend about 120,000 won.The atmosphere is good ^^"
"走進顧客，無需預約。找到這個地方有點棘手，尋找角落裡的建築物，然後走上樓梯，你就走上了正確的軌道。

很可能是我去過世界各地最好的威士忌酒吧之一，而且我一生中去過不少酒吧。氣氛、情緒、裝飾和員工都很完美，而且非常平衡。

我顯然會推薦參加威士忌飛行；這是一個展示品，無論是觀看工作人員倒酒還是讓自己倒酒都充滿樂趣！工作人員對威士忌非常了解，並花時間解釋註釋。當晚結束時，我印象深刻，最後買了一瓶帶回家，如果你是像我一樣的粉絲，我強烈建議你買一瓶。

一個我永遠不會忘記的夜晚，並希望有一天能再來。","Entering customers, no appointment is required.Finding this place is a bit tricky, looking for the buildings in the corner, and then on the stairs, you go on the right track.

It is likely that I have been to the best whiskey bar in the world, and I have been to a lot of bars in my life.The atmosphere, emotions, decoration and employees are perfect and very balanced.

I will obviously recommend participating in whiskey flight; this is a display, whether it is watching the staff pouring wine or making myself pour wine!The staff knows very much about whiskey and spends time to explain the annotation.At the end of the night, I was impressed. I bought a bottle and took it home. If you were a fan like me, I strongly suggested that you buy a bottle.

A night that I will never forget, and hope that one day I can come again."
從開始到結束都是一次美好的體驗。工作人員非常友善且知識淵博，菜單豐富（適合每個人），氛圍非常適合夜晚外出。,From the beginning to the end is a wonderful experience.The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The menu is rich (suitable for everyone). The atmosphere is very suitable for going out at night.
確實是威士忌愛好者的好去處。很幸運能夠品嚐到他們的一些稀有產品，也很高興得到團隊的善意幫助來選擇要購買的瓶子。,"It is indeed a good place for whiskey enthusiasts.Fortunately, they can taste some of their rare products, and they are also glad to get the team's goodwill help to choose the bottle to be purchased."
建議預約。英語流利，工作人員都很專業而且友善。你應該有 3 杯套裝。 Oloroso 獨奏雪莉酒和維諾酒對我來說很棒。配菜也很好。不錯的威士忌和良好的氛圍。,"Reservations are recommended.Fluent English, the staff are very professional and friendly.You should have 3 cups.Oloroso solo Shirley and Vino are great for me.The side dishes are also very good.Good whiskey and good atmosphere."
如果你只喝3種威士忌（每種30ml），你不會像我花那麼多錢。雞尾酒很有名，點了兩三杯，很好喝。在那裡工作的每個人都很好而且英語說得很好。我去的時候是聖誕節期間，當時是十點，人很多。如果你不想在這裡喝一杯，附近有很多酒吧，順便去一下也不錯。,"If you only drink 3 kinds of whiskey (30ml per type), you will not spend as much money as me.Cocktails are very famous. I ordered two or three cups and it was delicious.Everyone working there is good and English is very good.When I went to Christmas, it was ten o'clock at the time, and there were many people.If you don't want to drink a drink here, there are a lot of bars nearby, and it's good to go by the way."
"在台灣可以放鬆喝酒的酒吧。與烤肉店相連，所以食物很豐富。
有日文菜單，其餘都是英文的。
他會解釋。
噶瑪蘭威士忌有很多種。
您也可以享受比較飲料的樂趣。
還有雞尾酒和無酒精雞尾酒。
我可以輕鬆地在線預訂。","You can relax bars in Taiwan.Connected to the barbecue shop, so the food is rich.
There are Japanese menu, the rest are English.
He will explain.
There are many types of Karmaland whiskey.
You can also enjoy the fun of more drinks.
There are also cocktails and no alcoholic cocktails.
I can easily book online."
"來台北我一定會去的！我總是坐在櫃檯旁，工作人員會告訴我有關 KAVALAN 的各種事情，所以我很享受他們的談話，並沉浸在 KAVALAN 的世界中。一定要嚐嚐這裡的雞尾酒！
所有的零食份量都很大，所以如果你只招待一個人，我認為最好要少一點的份量。","I will definitely go to Taipei!I always sit at the counter, and the staff will tell me various things about Kavalan, so I enjoy their conversations and immerse themselves in Kavalan's world.Be sure to taste the cocktail here!
All snacks are very large, so if you only entertain one person, I think it is better to have less portion."
"Kabalan是BTS的RM和朴贊鬱導演也喜歡喝的東西！這是台灣代表性的單一麥芽威士忌，打破了專家認為威士忌不能在高溫高濕環境下釀造的偏見後創造出來的。

噶瑪蘭利用台灣不利的氣候條件，想出了一種熟成方法，可以讓木桶的味道更快滲透到果汁中。正因為如此，您可以感受到更深、更豐富的味道。

它擁有高品質的口感，僅三年的產品就在頂級蘇格蘭專家參加的盲品比賽中獲得第一名。儘管我沒有胃痛，但我還是被這種獨特而強烈的氣味所吸引，並發現自己一次又一次地回來。

我強烈建議您在旅行期間有一天喝噶瑪蘭威士忌而不是台灣啤酒。在卡瓦蘭威士忌酒吧，您可以真正享受不尋常的氛圍。

✔️ 如何使用噶瑪蘭威士忌吧
1️⃣ 參觀前，請使用Google地圖中的「預約」功能。只需選擇人數、日期和時間即可完成！
2️⃣ 上Buckskin啤酒吧所在的大樓二樓，按下牆上的台灣地圖按鈕。隱藏的威士忌酒吧的門打開了。
3️⃣ 依照工作人員的指示入座，菜單就會拿給你。有韓文版本，即使不懂中文也不用害怕。您還可以從友好的工作人員那裡獲得菜單推薦。
4️⃣ 點威士忌的時候，工作人員會問“你願意和我合照嗎？”如果您沿著入口走，您可以拍攝直接從木桶中取出威士忌的照片和影片。
5️⃣ 再次坐下，享受為您帶來的威士忌。酒吧的裝潢非常豪華，在喝威士忌之前你可能會被這裡的氣氛迷倒。","Kabalan is what BTS's RM and Park Zhanyu also like to drink!This is a representative single malt whiskey in Taiwan, which broke the prejudice created by experts that whiskey believes that the prejudice that whiskey cannot be brewed in a high temperature and high humidity environment.

Karmaland used Taiwan's unfavorable climatic conditions to come up with a mature method that allows the taste of the wooden barrels to penetrate into the juice faster.Because of this, you can feel deeper and richer.

It has a high -quality taste, and only three years of products won the first place in the blind competition participated by top Scottish experts.Although I had no stomach pain, I was attracted by this unique and strong smell, and I found myself back again and again.

I strongly recommend that you drink Karmaland whiskey without Taiwan beer during the trip.In the Kavan whiskey bar, you can really enjoy an unusual atmosphere.

兰️ How to use Karmaland whiskey?
1️⃣ Before visiting, please use the ""appointment"" function in Google Map.Just choose the number, date and time to complete!
2️⃣ On the second floor of the building where the Buckskin Beer Bar is located, press the Taiwan map button on the wall.The door of the hidden whiskey bar opened.
3️⃣ According to the staff's instructions, the menu will be given to you.There is a Korean version, don't be afraid even if you don't understand Chinese.You can also get menu recommendations from friendly staff.
4️⃣ When you order whiskey, the staff will ask, ""Are you willing to take a photo with me?"" If you walk along the entrance, you can take photos and videos of whiskey directly from the barrel.
5️⃣ Sit down again and enjoy the whiskey brought to you.The decoration of the bar is very luxurious, and you may be fascinated by the atmosphere here before drinking whiskey."
即使你不喝威士忌，你仍然可以來這裡享受一段美好時光。酒吧備有豐富的酒吧小吃和多種雞尾酒，讓您品嚐到最好的噶瑪蘭威士忌。酒吧很寬敞，調酒師很友好，隨時為您提供幫助。位於二樓，與燒烤餐廳共用一個空間。,"Even if you don't drink whiskey, you can still come here to enjoy a good time.The bar is rich in bar snacks and a variety of cocktails, allowing you to taste the best Karmaland whiskey.The bar is very spacious, and the bartender is very friendly to help you at any time.It is located on the second floor and shares a space with the barbecue restaurant."
"噶瑪蘭威士忌愛好者必去的目的地！ Kavalan 威士忌酒吧提供各種令人印象深刻的高品質威士忌，營造出迷人的氛圍並提供溫馨的服務。毫無疑問，我熱切期待在下次台北冒險期間再次光臨這家酒店。毫無疑問是個特殊的場地！

如果你喜歡威士忌，你一定要去看看。它很乾淨而且氣氛很好。為慶祝一周年，現訂購滿1,500新台幣以上送幸運券。","Karmaland whiskey enthusiasts must go!The Kavalan whiskey bar offers a variety of impressive high -quality whiskey, creating a charming atmosphere and providing warm services.There is no doubt that I was eagerly looking forward to visiting this hotel again during the next Taipei adventure.There is no doubt that it is a special venue!

If you like whiskey, you must go to see it.It is clean and the atmosphere is good.To celebrate the first anniversary, the lucky coupon is now available for more than 1,500 Taiwan dollars."
我在城裡待了幾天，很高興能抽出時間來參觀這個酒吧。  調酒師對這位外國人非常友善和熱情。  而且航班的價格/價格都很好。  如果您喜歡威士忌，強烈建議您停下來品嚐。  我會回來的。,"I stayed in the city for a few days, and I was glad to take time to visit the bar.The bartender is very friendly and enthusiastic about the foreigner.And the price/price of the flight is very good.If you like whiskey, it is strongly recommended that you stop to taste.I will come back."
"這是一家地下酒吧風格的噶瑪蘭威士忌酒吧。如果你走進大樓轉角處的入口二樓，有牛肉店嗎？有一個入口，右側有一個牡蠣形狀的按鈕。按下按鈕後，右側的木門就會打開。

威士忌當然很美味，每人應該點一杯。請注意，點得最多的3種飲品，1100NT酒精以1杯收費（性價比最佳）
就我個人而言，我最喜歡 Olorosso 雪利酒桶。這嘗起來就像是經過充氣的，而不是直接從木桶裡倒出來的。
直接從木桶中倒出的酒精有 6 種。酒精含量很高，還有很多辛辣的味道……下次我會去嘗試更多的充氣瓶！

而且……我通常不會把威士忌和食物一起吃，但我餓了，所以我點了松露薯條，它們太美味了……看起來他們有磨碎的新鮮松露，而不是松露油。我沒有拍照ㅜㅜ 真是令人垂涎欲滴，提拉米蘇也很好吃！ （具體時間我不記得了，但有截止點餐時間，所以如果想從菜單點餐的話，就得早於12點去）

工作人員很友好，他們自己磨製的冰塊品質很好。還有韓國菜單，營業時間一直到凌晨1點。可以刷卡支付！","Going to the Ground Floor Bar Style Gen the Maran Whiskey Bar.If you walk into the entrance to the corner of the building, is there a beef shop?There is a portal with a oyster shape button on the right.After pressing the button, the ilk door on the right will open.

Whiskey is of course delicious, each person should order a cup.Please note that the most 3 drinks, 1100NT alcohol charge for 1 cup (best value for money)
For me personally, I prefer Oloosso Xueli wine barrel.It tastes like the inflatableness of slang, and the unlearn directly from the wooden barrels.
There are six alcohol poured directly from the wooden barrels.There is a high alcohol content, and there are many spicy flavors... next time I will try more inflatable bottles!

And……… I usually don’t eat with whiskeys and food, but I’m hungry, so I order truffle fries, which are too delicious to…… look at the things that have a grinding fresh muffins and unrest muffin oil.I have a photo shoot, the really snug, tiramisu is also very tasty!(Specific time I do not remember, but there is a deadline, so if you want to say from the menu, it's just 12pm)

Very friendly staff, and by grinding ice cubes very well.There are also Korean menus, opening hours until 1am.You can brush cards!"
這家酒吧絕對是太棒了。我們度過了一個愉快的夜晚，調酒師是一個真正的說故事的人。我們喜歡所有關於威士忌和雞尾酒背後的故事。味道真的很好，而且擺盤讓它更特別。酒吧位於二樓，需要先走進Buckskin，才能進入暗門。,"This bar is definitely great.We spent a pleasant night, and the bartender was a real person who told stories.We like all stories behind whiskey and cocktails.The taste is really good, and it makes it more special.The bar is located on the second floor. You need to walk into Buckskin to enter the dark door."
"工廠太遠了，所以適合在城市裡快速有趣的旅行。
價格比台灣的價格貴。","The factory is too far away, so it is suitable for fast and interesting travel in the city.
The price is more expensive than the price of Taiwan."
您可以享受各種卡巴蘭系列。如果您不知道該買什麼，可以在這裡找到適合您的威士忌。,"You can enjoy a variety of Kabalan series.If you don't know what to buy, you can find whiskey that suits you here."
我在台北最喜歡的酒吧，也許是台灣。它不僅僅是一個漂亮的酒吧。雖然他們是一家以KAVALAN威士忌開始的酒吧，但有各種雞尾酒向你展示他們威士忌的可能性。但如果你看看他們的菜單，這是一家向你展示台灣文化的酒吧。各種台灣元素，美食、花藝、飲料、味道，甚至節慶。這是向外國朋友展示的最佳酒吧。還有一個您每週都可以去的酒吧，並以季節性特色菜來充實您的假期。就是喜歡它。強烈推薦。,"My favorite bar in Taipei may be Taiwan.It is not just a beautiful bar.Although they are a bar started with Kavalan whiskey, there are various cocktails to show you the possibility of whiskey.But if you look at their menu, this is a bar that shows you Taiwanese culture.Various Taiwanese elements, food, floral art, drinks, taste, and even festivals.This is the best bar displayed to foreign friends.There is also a bar you can go every week, and you can use seasonal special dishes to enrich your holidays.Just like it.Strongly recommended."
"沒有華麗的招牌，所以從外面看就像是一個隱秘的地方，你甚至不知道如何進去。
工作人員都很友善，雖然我不會說太多日語，但他們會用中文或英文向你解釋，所以你可以在那裡度過舒適的時光。我們提供多種 Kavalan 粉絲樂意購買的產品，包括在日本很難找到的稀有 Kavalan。
首先，您可以享受飲料比較套餐，然後以噶瑪蘭威士忌為基礎的雞尾酒，這樣您就可以度過充滿噶瑪蘭威士忌的時光。
即使在工作日也很繁忙，因此如果您與兩個或更多人一起參觀，最好進行預訂。
當我再次來到台北時，我肯定會再次訪問。","There is no gorgeous signboard, so it looks like a secret place from the outside. You don't even know how to get in.
The staff are very friendly. Although I do n’t say too much Japanese, they will explain to you in Chinese or English, so you can spend comfortable time there.We provide a variety of products that Kavalan fans are willing to buy, including rare Kavalan that is difficult to find in Japan.
First of all, you can enjoy a drink comparison package, and then cocktail based on Karmaland whiskey, so that you can spend time full of Karmaland whiskey.
Even if you are busy on your working day, if you visit with two or more people, it is best to book.
When I came to Taipei again, I would definitely visit again."
"事實上，如果你喝了很多噶瑪蘭，可能並沒有什麼特別的好處。 🙄
不過，卡巴蘭本身就很好吃，所以值得一去！ 🤩🤗

食物比我想像的要平庸,,,🙄
你可能沒有註意到，因為飲料是如此美味，但食物卻非常令人失望。

由於雞尾酒和威士忌酒杯的價格與韓國相比非常便宜，
這裡是品嚐各種優質威士忌的最佳場所！ XD

這裡的杯墊比我想像的還要漂亮，而且他們是單獨賣的哈哈。
我帶了一個。 😍","In fact, if you drink a lot of Karmalan, there may not be any special benefits.Bleak
However, Kablan itself is delicious, so it is worth going!Bleak

Food is more mediocre than I think ,,,,
You may not notice that because the drink is so delicious, but the food is very disappointing.

Since the price of cocktails and whiskey glass is very cheaper than South Korea,
This is the best place to taste various high -quality whiskey!XD

The coasters here are more beautiful than I think, and they are sold alone haha.
I brought one.Bleak"
"我在評論中聽說旁邊沒有什麼可以點的，但根本沒有！
一定要吃炸魷魚。
這是我一生中吃過的最好吃的炸魷魚。
我沒有嘗試過，但是菜單上有很多有趣的雞尾酒，服務也很好。
請繼續自行加水。
有很多韓國人來這裡。
每次去台灣都會去看看。","I heard that there is nothing to order next to the comments, but there is no!
Be sure to eat fried squid.
This is the best fried squid I have ever eaten in my life.
I haven't tried it, but there are many interesting cocktails on the menu, and the service is very good.
Please continue to add water by yourself.
Many Koreans come here.
Every time I go to Taiwan, I will see it."
受到工作人員的熱烈歡迎，調酒師的推薦等，並推薦招牌菜單。驚人的組合，創意十足。氣氛很好。他們的威士忌很棒，應該帶回家。我會再回來的！,"It is warmly welcomed by the staff, the recommendation of the bartender, etc., and recommend the signature menu.Amazing combination, full of creativity.The atmosphere is very good.Their whiskey is great and should be brought home.I will come back again!"
"如果你喜歡噶瑪蘭，這裡就是你該去的地方！
調酒師動作很快而且樂於助人。
不幸的是，我更願意稱其為“普通”酒吧或雞尾酒吧，而不是威士忌酒吧。
這裡非常吵鬧，音樂聲音太大，不適合喝威士忌和愉快地交談。
酒吧本身漂亮又乾淨，可能有點太花俏了
特別是對於響亮且錯誤的音樂類型只有 3 顆星","If you like Karmaland, this is where you should go!
The bartender moves quickly and is helpful.
Unfortunately, I am more willing to call it a ""ordinary"" bar or cocktail bar, not whiskey bar.
It's very noisy here, the sound of music is too loud, not suitable for drinking whiskey and talking happily.
The bar itself is beautiful and clean, it may be a bit too fancy
Especially for loud and wrong music types only 3 stars"
很棒的酒吧，供應台灣最好的創意之一——卡瑪蘭威士忌。我喜歡他們的飲料展示了該國的當地農產品和特產。期待有很多以不同類型的茶和/或亞洲風味為主題的選擇。我們喜歡我們所有的飲料，並在那裡度過了一個愉快的夜晚，布萊恩確保我們得到很好的照顧。我對他們在酒吧裡有威士忌桶的事實感到驚訝，沒有比這更新鮮的了！,"A great bar, one of the best ideas in Taiwan -Kamalan whiskey.I like their drinks to show the country's local agricultural products and specialties.Looking forward to many choices with different types of tea and/or Asian flavors.We like all of our drinks and spend a pleasant night there, Brian guarantees that we have good care.I was surprised by the fact that they had whiskey barrels in the bar, not fresher than this!"
"我在想什麼時候再來，所以我有點用力過猛了。
威士忌更不用說了，小吃也不錯，不過你得吃完晚餐才走，我身體不舒服。","I wondered when I came again, so I was a bit too hard.
Not to mention the whiskey, the snack is also good, but you have to leave after dinner, and I am uncomfortable."
"台北最酷的地方，可在涼爽的環境中享用噶瑪蘭威士忌和雞尾酒。

我預訂了卡瓦蘭威士忌酒吧參加私人婚禮，我們所有的客人都對卓越的服務和優質飲料感到滿意。

感謝 James Lin 和 Kavalan 威士忌酒吧團隊為 Kavalan 品牌高舉旗幟。","The coolest place in Taipei can enjoy Karmaland whiskey and cocktails in a cool environment.

I booked the Kavan whiskey bar to attend a private wedding, and all our guests were satisfied with excellent service and high -quality drinks.

Thank you James Lin and Kavalan whiskey bar team for holding up the banner for the Kavalan brand."
"它位於一家烤肉餐廳內。
除非你問，否則很難找到入口。
正常進入烤肉店門口並向左走。
當我轉身時，我看到牆上掛著一張台灣地圖。
有一個門開關。
當您按下按鈕時，照片後面可以看到一扇形狀像桶的門打開。
就像進入了一個秘密酒吧♪
卡瓦蘭的味道很甜，即使是女性也很容易飲用。
這裡有日文。
我不太懂，所以如果你會說英語
他們將為您提供您選擇的酒精飲料！","It is located in a barbecue restaurant.
Unless you ask, it is difficult to find the entrance.
Enter the door of the barbecue shop and go left to the left.
When I turned around, I saw a Taiwanese map hanging on the wall.
There is a door switch.
When you press the button, you can see a door -like door open behind the photo.
It's like entering a secret bar ♪
Cavan's taste is very sweet, and even women are easy to drink.
There are Japanese here.
I don’t know much, so if you can speak English
They will provide you with the alcoholic beverages you choose!"
這是我第二次來，仍然很好。工作人員也很友善,"This is the second time I have come, and it is still very good.The staff is also very friendly"
"當你進去的時候，他們會先問你是否有預訂，然後問你來自哪個國家。
有韓文菜單。
最低價格為 1,900 美元（約 80,000 韓元）起。
如果在那裡點一份小吃，價格就超過10萬韓元。
調酒師不關心顧客，只回應訂單。
還不如買一瓶假酒的Vinobarique...","When you go in, they will first ask if you have a booking, and then ask which country you are from.
There are Korean menu.
The minimum price is 1,900 US dollars (about 80,000 won).
If you order a snack there, the price will exceed 100,000 won.
The bartender does not care about customers, but only responds to orders.
It's better to buy a bottle of vinobarique ..."
由於是直營店，所以可以以低廉的價格享用各種KAVALAN，還有比較飲料套餐和桶裝清酒！很方便找到您最喜歡的商品作為紀念品購買！氣氛很豪華，非常好！,"Because it is a direct -operated store, you can enjoy a variety of Kavalan at low prices, as well as compared beverage packages and barrels!It is very convenient to find your favorite product as a souvenir to buy!The atmosphere is luxurious and very good!"
美妙的體驗！正如預期的那樣，飲料很棒，但服務更上一層樓。我們的服務員賽勒斯知識淵博，樂於助人，對不同的威士忌提出了很好的建議。而且冰塊晶瑩剔透……真正的威士忌飲用者會欣賞這一點。,"Wonderful experience!As expected, the drink is great, but the service is higher.Our waiter is knowledgeable and helpful, and made good suggestions for different whiskey.And ice cubes are crystal clear ... real whiskey drinking users will appreciate this."
"餐點的品質很好，雖然是自己燒烤，但他們似乎不願意提供任何食用油讓我煮盤子裡的蔬菜，真可惜。
服務還可以，就是換網對我來說太頻繁了。人們很友好，氣氛還可以。","The quality of the meal is very good. Although it is a barbecue, they seem to be unwilling to provide any vegetable oil to make me cook the vegetables in the plate.
The service is okay, it is too frequent for me to change the net.People are very friendly and the atmosphere is okay."
展示台灣精釀威士忌的絕佳場所。我總是帶著來台灣旅遊的朋友來這裡，體驗一直都很棒。他們也提供各種零售的噶瑪蘭威士忌酒瓶。,"Show the great place for Taiwan's craft whiskey.I always bring friends who come to Taiwan to travel here, and the experience has always been great.They also provide various retail Karmaland whiskey bottle."
"友善、周到的服務
特殊經歷
所有系列的威士忌都可以體驗和購買。
來台北一定要來！","Friendly, thoughtful service
Special experience
All series of whiskey can experience and buy.
Must come to Taipei!"
喜歡這裡的氛圍和友好的工作人員 - 感謝 Alice 提供的有用建議，讓體驗變得更好！威士忌也很棒:),Like the atmosphere and friendly staff here -thanks to the useful suggestions provided by Alice to make the experience better!Whiskey is also great :)
"氣氛很好，食物很美味。
給我留下了深刻的印象，因為為我服務的男性工作人員非常友好。","The atmosphere is very good and the food is delicious.
I left a deep impression on me, because the male staff members who served me were very friendly."
"我可以在乾淨寬敞的室內放鬆地喝酒。
穿過烤肉店的入口就到了酒吧的入口。
如果你有點迷路，工作人員會出來引導你。","I can drink in a clean and spacious room.
The entrance to the barbecue restaurant reached the entrance to the bar.
If you are a little lost, the staff will come out to guide you."
我對威士忌了解不多。但在這裡您可以享受真正特別的體驗。這是我們5天行程中最特別的體驗。在這裡，射擊是直接從槍管中進行的。它可能比你從瓶子裡得到的辣一點，但這是一種味道炸彈般的體驗。可惜沒能去啤酒廠。,"I don't know much about whiskey.But here you can enjoy the real and special experience.This is the most special experience in our 5 -day trip.Here, the shooting is performed directly from the barrel.It may be a bit spicy than you get from the bottle, but this is a flavor bomb -like experience.Unfortunately, I failed to go to the beer plant."
"我第一次開始喝威士忌。
我的一個好朋友告訴我，台灣有一些美味的威士忌。雖然因為交通堵塞和陌生的計程車司機而遲到了，但我還是玩得很開心。
讓我特別高興的是我能夠認識一些很棒的老師。
我愛我的老師。","I started to drink whiskey for the first time.
A good friend of mine told me that there were some delicious whiskey in Taiwan.Although I was late because of traffic jams and strange taxi drivers, I still played happily.
What makes me particularly happy is that I can know some great teachers.
I love my teacher."
很榮幸能見證台灣威士忌的誕生。買了很多威士忌並註冊了 VIP 會員資格。如果照我的方式，我會每種威士忌都買 2 份😂 …,"I am honored to witness the birth of Taiwan whiskey.I bought a lot of whiskey and registered VIP membership qualifications.If I use my way, I will buy 2 parts every whiskey ..."
"氣氛很棒，雞尾酒也很美味。
我喜歡噶瑪蘭，所以我喜歡以噶瑪蘭為基礎的雞尾酒。
我去那裡是因為我很好奇那會是什麼樣子。
下次旅行我還會再去。
我推薦夜空","The atmosphere is great, and the cocktails are also delicious.
I like Karmaland, so I like cocktails based on Karmalan.
I went there because I was curious what it would look like.
I will go again next time.
I recommend night sky"
"對於一個學生來說，這個價格是不菲的，但是
能夠嘗試不同的東西並看看哪條線最好，真是太好了！
雞尾酒也不錯","For a student, this price is expensive, but
It's great to be able to try different things and see which line is the best!
Cocktail is also good"
"如果你想在台灣留下美好回憶

如果您擔心購買噶瑪蘭威士忌

如果您想與友好的調酒師度過愉快的時光

這是一個很棒的地方","If you want to leave a good memory in Taiwan

If you are worried about buying Karmaland whiskey

If you want to have a happy time with a friendly bartender

This is a great place"
"4月29日到店/預約7點開放抵達

我聽說如果你按住地圖形狀，它就會打開，但它去哪裡了？我找了找，卻沒有，差點迷路了，不過因為是店中店，所以只好到二樓的餐廳裡去找。

它比在附近的酒吧喝 Kavalan 便宜，是一個合理的選擇。

我強烈推薦給那些還沒有在韓國體驗過多種卡巴蘭的人。

事實上，我認為你不需要吃任何零食。喝韓國流行的雪利酒、Vinobarique和馬德拉酒三種類型/如果你已經嘗試過這三種類型，請嘗試更昂貴的系列，例如莫斯卡特爾和皮諾。你可以喝一杯。

調酒師能夠用英語為顧客服務，不僅親切地傾聽客人的要求，還對有關酒的調性的問題進行詳細的解釋，讓我們度過了一段舒適愉快的時光。","April 29th, go to the store/make an appointment to open 7 o'clock

I heard that if you hold down the map shape, it will open, but where is it going?I looked for it, but I almost lost my way, but because it was a store in the store, I had to go to the restaurant on the second floor.

It is cheaper than drinking Kavalan in a nearby bar and is a reasonable choice.

I strongly recommend those who have not experienced many Kabalaland in South Korea.

In fact, I don't think you need to eat any snacks.Drink three types of Sherry, Vinobarique, and Madra. If you have tried these three types, you can try more expensive series, such as Moscarter and Pino.You can drink a cup.

The bartender can serve customers with English, not only listening to the requirements of the guests, but also explaining the problems of the tone of the wine, let us have a comfortable and pleasant time."
價格有點貴，但是可以喝到噶瑪蘭稀有的威士忌。平日，不需預約。我被告知要等5分鐘，然後就進了商店。入口很難找到。按下左牆上的台灣地圖鈕即可開門。,"The price is a bit expensive, but you can drink the rare whiskey of Karmaland.There is no need to make an appointment on weekdays.I was told to wait for 5 minutes and then entered the store.It's hard to find at the entrance.Press the Taiwan map button on the left wall to open the door."
"不對，為什麼大家不寫下怎麼開門呢？ ... 第一次進去的時候，尤其是去晚了，我在2樓，餐廳已經關門了，所以我很震驚。 ，有一個暗門，但是打不開第二個尷尬……原來是一轉身，有一個東西就彈出來，一按或者就打開了。按羽毛形狀
Cask Cabalan，在韓國吃不到的...我很高興價格是1,100，你可以選擇3種類型的樣品，或者選擇你自己的，只需獲得推薦。
它與瓶裝威士忌的不同之處在於它具有更強烈、更辛辣的氣味。所以，吃完飯後，請過來喝一杯。吃了這個連幽門螺旋桿菌都會死...","No, why don't you open the door without writing?... When I went in for the first time, especially late, I was on the second floor, and the restaurant was closed, so I was shocked.There is a secret door, but I ca n’t open the second embarrassment ... It turned out that when it turned around, there was something popped up, and it opened or opened.Shaped by feather
Cask Cabalan, I ca n’t eat it in South Korea ... I am very happy that the price is 1,100. You can choose 3 types of samples, or choose your own, just get recommended.
The difference between it is different from the bottle whiskey that it has a stronger and more spicy smell.So, after dinner, please come over for a drink.After eating this pylori, even H. pylori will die ..."
如果您喜歡威士忌，尤其是單一麥芽威士忌，那麼您一定聽說過 Kavalan，他們在相對較短的時間內建立了這個品牌，同樣他們也釀造了一些屢獲殊榮的令人驚嘆的威士忌。  口味是一個非常個人化的事情，但我喜歡他們的 Vinho Barrique 和 olorosso 雪利酒桶，絕對值得您，而且工作人員知識淵博，而且威士忌航班物超所值。,"If you like whiskey, especially a single malt whiskey, then you must have heard of Kavalan. They have established this brand in a relatively short period of time, and they also breed some amazing whiskey.Taste is a very personal thing, but I like their Vinho Barrique and Olorosso Sherry Barrel. It is definitely worth you, and the staff is well -known, and the whiskey sailing is worth it."
我們透過3種品嚐套餐品嚐了美味的清酒。,We tasted delicious sake through 3 kinds of tasting sets.
"工作人員很友好，威士忌也很棒。
店裡氣氛很好，小吃價格也很合理。","The staff is very friendly and whiskey is also great.
The atmosphere in the store is very good, and the price of snacks is also reasonable."
"有點像是隱藏的酒吧。您需要按（某處）按鈕才能打開門。
種類繁多的威士忌和威士忌雞尾酒。如果您不確定，可以請友善的工作人員介紹。總的來說是一次很棒的體驗。請注意，與其他酒吧相比，它的價格要貴一些。","A bit like a hidden bar.You need to press (somewhere) to open the door.
A variety of types of whiskey and whiskey cocktails.If you are not sure, you can ask a friendly staff to introduce.In general, it is a great experience.Please note that it is more expensive than other bars."
"非常好的酒吧，位於大樓的二樓，與餐廳相同。當牆壁滑開時，入口有些隱藏。我認為最好提前預訂，但我走進去，效果很好。

每個人都超級友善。調酒師詹姆斯知道他在做什麼，會說英語，可以根據您的喜好調製一杯飲料。我嘗試了煙熏馬提尼，做得很好。接下來，我喝了一杯純淨的煙燻卡瓦蘭，但喝了幾口後就變硬了。

氣氛優雅但不做作。除夕那天在那裡我真的很開心。","A very good bar, located on the second floor of the building, is the same as the restaurant.When the wall slides, the entrance is a bit hidden.I think it's best to book in advance, but I walk in and the effect is very good.

Everyone is super friendly.The bartender James knows what he is doing and speak English, and you can make a drink based on your preference.I tried the smoky Martini and did a good job.Next, I drank a cup of pure smoky Kavan, but after a few mouthfuls, I harden.

The atmosphere is elegant but not contrived.I am really happy there on New Year's Eve."
"能夠體驗各種噶瑪蘭威士忌真是太棒了。
新推出的15週年紀念雪莉酒真的很好喝。
非常滿意！","It is great to be able to experience all kinds of Karmalan whiskey.
The new 15th anniversary of Shirley is really delicious.
Very satisfied!"
非常適合雞尾酒。但我實際上認為非獨家威士忌選擇是時好時壞。很多都沒有我想要的平滑度。真的很棒的服務和很好的氛圍。雖然價格昂貴。,Very suitable for cocktails.But I actually think that the choice of non -independent whiskey is good and bad.Many do not have the smoothness I want.It's really good service and a good atmosphere.Although the price is expensive.
"我認為這是一次非常獨特的體驗——你很難找到一家酒吧可以讓你以這裡提供的價格嘗試卡瓦蘭。我們進行了預訂（這很容易在網站上找到），但事實證明我們是酒吧里前一個小時左右唯一的客人。

我們選擇了乘飛機——大約 30 美元，喝了三杯 Kavalan，其中一些來自入口處的限量版酒桶。

我認為這個地方最酷的部分是入口。進入大樓後，請前往二樓。當你穿過餐廳時，向左轉，將台灣的輪廓按在牆上——桶門就會打開，露出卡瓦蘭酒吧。

工作人員非常友好，引導我們做出「最佳」選擇。他們消息靈通，能夠解釋不同類型的葡萄酒是如何陳釀和製作的。我們還瀏覽了搭配菜單——威士忌配小零食——這肯定會讓我回味無窮。他們有小口的食物可以搭配你的飲料。

裡面非常黑暗和安靜——這是品嚐如此美妙的飲料的完美氛圍。","I think this is a very unique experience -it is difficult for you to find a bar that allows you to try Cavan at the price provided here.We made a reservation (this is easy to find on the website), but it turns out that we are the only guest of about an hour before the bar.

We chose a plane -about $ 30, drank three cups of Kavalan, some of which came from the entrance at the entrance.

I think the coolest part of this place is the entrance.After entering the building, please go to the second floor.When you pass through the restaurant, turn to the left, press the outline of Taiwan on the wall -the barrel door will open, exposing the Kavan bar.

The staff is very friendly to guide us to make the ""best"" choice.Their news can explain how different types of wine are aged and made.We also browsed the matching menu -whiskey with small snacks -this will definitely make me have an endless aftertaste.They have small foods to match your drink.

It is very dark and quiet inside -this is the perfect atmosphere of taste such a wonderful drink."
這絕對是完美的。工作人員賽勒斯提供了最好的服務。謝謝你，我度過了一段快樂的時光！謝謝,"This is definitely perfect.Staff Cyrus provides the best service.Thank you, I spent a happy time!Thanks"
強烈推薦。城裡最好的酒吧之一。噶瑪蘭威士忌，獨特的雞尾酒，價格合理，環境優美。酒吧大約有 50 個座位，也提供食物。,"Strongly recommended.One of the best bars in the city.Karmaland whiskey, unique cocktail, has a reasonable price and beautiful environment.There are about 50 seats in the bar and also provide food."
我真的很喜歡這個酒吧。我以前從未嘗試過卡瑪蘭威士忌，但這次飛行非常棒。工作人員推薦了一些，味道都很棒。氣氛真的很平靜和放鬆。,"I really like this bar.I have never tried the Kamaland whiskey before, but this time was great.The staff recommended some, and the taste was great.The atmosphere is really calm and relaxed."
在台北購買噶瑪蘭威士忌的最佳地點。很棒的優雅內飾，很棒的友好的東西！我特別喜歡酒吧和木桶的暗門！,"The best place to buy Karmalan whiskey in Taipei.Great elegant interior, great friendly things!I especially like the secret door of bar and wooden barrels!"
服務很棒！被介紹了許多噶瑪蘭威士忌。我去的那天晚上很空，所以氣氛非常安靜和放鬆。,"The service is great!Many Karmaland whiskey was introduced.The night I went was empty, so the atmosphere was very quiet and relaxed."
如果您認為這個酒吧只是您不需要去的休息站，我強烈建議您改變主意。調酒師詹姆斯確實是一位技藝大師。我們都喝過太苦、太甜或太酸的雞尾酒，但我的經歷並非如此。詹姆斯與我訂購的所有雞尾酒實現了成分的完美平衡。他還了解您所點飲料的所有信息，並且能夠在您實際購買之前準確地向您解釋您所點的內容。我迫不及待地想下次再來台灣！,"If you think this bar is just a rest station you don't need to go, I strongly recommend that you change your mind.The bartender James is indeed a master of skill.We all drank too bitter, sweet or too sour cocktails, but my experience was not the case.James and all the cocktails I ordered to achieve the perfect balance of ingredients.He also understands all the information of your drinks and can accurately explain the content you point to you before you buy.I can't wait to come to Taiwan next time!"
很棒的酒吧，有很多 Kavalan 的選擇。雞尾酒都很特別。絕對值得一遊！,"A great bar, there are many Kavalan choices.Cocktails are very special.Absolutely worth visiting!"
"服務很好而且很吸引人。 (≧∇≤)b
非常感謝對細節的關注，例如威士忌酒杯是用戴著手套的手遞過來的，因此沒有指紋。","The service is very good and attractive.(≧∇ ≤) B
Thank you very much for your details. For example, the whiskey glass is handed over with a hand wearing gloves, so there is no fingerprint."
我們在這裡度過了一段美好的時光。我們剛剛去了一個非常吵鬧的酒吧，所以希望我們的下一站有一個更涼爽的氛圍。這個地方太完美了！氣氛很好，我們仍然可以交談。工作人員對他們的工作充滿熱情，並花時間描述每杯飲料。飲料獨特而美妙，提拉米蘇也很棒。強烈推薦！,"We have a good time here.We just went to a very noisy bar, so we hope that our next stop will have a cooler atmosphere.This place is too perfect!The atmosphere is good, we can still talk.The staff is full of enthusiasm for their work and spend time describing each drink.The drink is unique and wonderful, and Tiramisu is also great.Recommended strongly!"
如果你喜歡威士忌，你將會有最好的體驗。這是一家由Kingka Group最近推出的威士忌酒吧，該集團經營Kavalan Distillery。亞洲最好的威士忌，充分擁抱熱帶的炎熱，在這裡只需400元就能買到。您可以品嚐到真正意義上的CS威士忌。高素質的主人親自從木桶中抽取威士忌。除非你在這裡嘗試過一杯CS，否則不要去任何地方說你喜歡威士忌。,"If you like whiskey, you will have the best experience.This is a whiskey bar recently launched by Kingka Group, which runs Kavalan Distillery.The best whiskey in Asia fully embraces the heat of the tropical, and it can be bought at 400 yuan here.You can taste the real CS whiskey.The high -quality owner personally extracts whiskey from the barrel.Unless you have tried a cup of CS here, don't go to anywhere to say that you like whiskey."
氣氛很棒，周圍很安靜。我和朋友一起去的，每人花費約30美元。認為這是一個很好的價值。,"The atmosphere is great, and the surroundings are quiet.I went with my friends, and each person spent about $ 30.Think this is a good value."
調酒師應該專注於自己的事情，而不是去勾搭女性顧客。當我出去上廁所時，我女朋友被兩個調酒師調情了。修理它。,"The bartender should focus on their own affairs, not to hook up female customers.When I went to the toilet, my girlfriend was flirted with two bartenders.Repair it."
兩個人參觀並點了炸薯條和三人菜單（3 杯飲料）。我試著分享三人菜單，但他們說我必須每人點一杯飲料。這是不靈活的。但工作人員很友好，服務也很棒。,"Two people visited and ordered fried French fries and menu menus (3 cups of drinks).I tried to share the menu, but they said I had to order a drink per person.This is not flexible.But the staff is very friendly and the service is great."
我向所有對噶瑪蘭威士忌感興趣的人推薦它。你可以品嚐到在韓國很難找到的各種噶瑪蘭威士忌，就連雞尾酒也很棒。因為我打算參觀一家釀酒廠，所以我對以卡瓦蘭威士忌為基礎的雞尾酒感到好奇，而不是喝它。喝了3杯。,"I recommend it to everyone who is interested in Karmalan whiskey.You can taste all kinds of Karmaland whiskey that is difficult to find in South Korea, and even cocktails are great.Because I plan to visit a brewery, I am curious about cocktails based on Cavan whiskey, instead of drinking it.I drank 3 cups."
"如果你來台北，一定要
如果你喜歡喝酒，絕對可以
30ml 塞尚三重奏 1,100 新台幣
點心：約300個炸土豆
性價比非常不錯
氣氛很好。","If you come to Taipei, you must
If you like to drink, you can definitely
30ml Cezanne Triple 1,100 NT $ 1,100
Dim Slim: About 300 fried potatoes
The price / performance ratio is very good
The atmosphere is very good."
"可以體驗KAVALAN威士忌魅力的酒吧
最好提前預約。
您可以直接將 KAVALAN 威士忌桶中的威士忌倒入您的酒杯中。","You can experience the charm of Kavalan whiskey charm
It's best to make an appointment in advance.
You can directly pour the whiskey in the Kavalan whiskey barrel into your wine glass."
"很棒的氛圍，非常友好和專業的工作人員，

您可以按下台灣形狀的按鈕打開餐廳的側門進入。饒舌風格！

這家酒吧由 Kavalan 威士忌公司經營。第一次嘗試，是很好的體驗。雖然我已經是一隻老狗了，無法教新技巧，哈哈。我嘗試過的所有他們的產品都有一種常見的果味甜朗姆酒的味道。與優質蘇格蘭威士忌有很大不同，但值得嘗試。

酒吧小吃的選擇很好，嘗試了大蒜薯條和冷切奶酪。很好。

亮點是台灣風格的友善服務。

非常值得一遊。除非獨自一人，否則請提前預訂。即使是周日晚上也是爆滿的","A great atmosphere, very friendly and professional staff,

You can press the Taiwan -shaped button to open the side door of the restaurant and enter.Rap -up style!

This bar is operated by Kavalan whiskey.The first attempt is a good experience.Although I am already an old dog, I can't teach new skills, haha.All their products I have tried have a common taste of fruity sweetness.It is very different from high -quality Scottish whiskey, but it is worth trying.

Bar snacks have a good choice, tried garlic fries and cold cut cheese.very good.

The highlight is the friendly service of Taiwan -style.

Very worthwhile.Unless you are alone, please book in advance.Even on Sunday evening, it is full"
雖然是工作日，人比預期多，但很吵/但這不是一個安靜的酒吧/我喜歡適合喝酒的氛圍，工作人員也很主動地解釋事情。,"Although it is a working day, there are more people than expected, but it is very noisy/but this is not a quiet bar/I like the atmosphere suitable for drinking. The staff also actively explained things."
"這確實是世界上最好的威士忌。找到台灣按鈕然後你就會打開門。
威士忌非常好喝，雞尾酒也很好喝。","This is indeed the best whiskey in the world.Find the Taiwan button and then open the door.
The whiskey is very delicious and the cocktails are also delicious."
"首先，門難找。感覺就像一個藏身處。我去的時候沒有預約，不過大概20分鐘就進去了。燈光、家具、天花板上懸掛的插花？真是太複雜了。
我選擇了威士忌品嚐套餐。
一位開朗的女士向我解釋了它，但它太技術性了，我聽不懂。
我一邊嚐一邊查字典裡這個字的意思。","First, the door is difficult to find.It feels like a hiding place.I didn't make an appointment when I went, but I went in about 20 minutes.Lighting, furniture, and flower arrangement hanging on the ceiling?It's too complicated.
I chose the whiskey tasting package.
A cheerful lady explained to me, but it was too technical and I couldn't understand.
I tasted the meaning of the word in the dictionary while trying."
由噶瑪蘭直接經營的威士忌酒吧。按下台灣形狀的按鈕即可開啟地下酒吧風格的入口。平日沒有預約，但是等了15分鐘就可以進去了。比較稀有的桶裝飲料可能會貴一些，但還是推薦的。就我個人而言，我發現瑪歌桶很美味。,"The whiskey bar operated directly by Karmaland.Press the Taiwan -shaped button to open the underground bar style entrance.There is no appointment on weekdays, but after 15 minutes, you can go in.The rare barrel drinks may be more expensive, but it is still recommended.Personally, I found that the Magoga barrel was delicious."
"地下酒吧。很棒的員工和很棒的地方！
我們可以喝合理的價格。
工作人員非常友善和專業。","Bar underground bar.Great employees and great places!
We can drink reasonable prices.
The staff is very friendly and professional."
很棒的雞尾酒，充滿台灣風情，氣氛非常棒。,"The great cocktail is full of Taiwanese style, and the atmosphere is great."
"很高興能夠以這個價格嘗試各種菜餚。
我不知道，因為我沒有嘗試過這裡的食物，但氣氛很好，工作人員也非常友好。
請注意，平日和週末設有每人最低價格。","I am glad to try various dishes at this price.
I don't know, because I haven't tried the food here, but the atmosphere is very good, and the staff is very friendly.
Please note that there is a minimum price per person on weekdays and weekends."
店內有一種隱密的氛圍，我很喜歡。我們建議比較三種噶瑪蘭，但如果您不太喜歡酒精，請在選擇時注意酒精含量。 工作人員很有禮貌，英語流利，溝通沒有壓力。,"There is a secret atmosphere in the store, I like it very much.We recommend comparing three kinds of Karmaland, but if you don't like alcohol, please pay attention to alcohol content when choosing.The staff is very polite, fluent in English, and there is no pressure on communication."
不錯的酒吧，喜歡老式雞尾酒！服務很好，一切都解釋的很詳細。肯定會回去,"Good bar, like old -fashioned cocktails!The service is very good, everything is explained in detail.I will definitely go back"
威士忌愛好者的好地方。噶瑪蘭的品質和員工將為您提供完美的時光。,A good place for whiskey lovers.Karmaland's quality and employees will provide you with perfect time.
真是一次有趣的經驗。  訂製雞尾酒和令人驚嘆的威士忌。  結合優質的服務。,Really an interesting experience.Custom cocktails and amazing whiskey.Combined with high -quality services.
"是一家非常有氣氛的店。
威士忌是一種微甜的威士忌。","It is a very atmospheric shop.
Whiskey is a slightly sweet whiskey."
"6月23日第一次來，環境好，氣氛好
我將重新審視本月的可用行程🤩","The first time on June 23, the environment is good, the atmosphere is good
I will re -examine the available itinerary of this month 🤩"
布萊恩正在為我服務。這次飛行是一次體驗——他們從木桶中取出的酒的展示非常精彩，味道也很棒。真的很酷的經驗 - 下次我一定會再去台北！,Brian is serving me.This flight was an experience -the display of the wine taken from the barrel was very exciting and the taste was great.Really cool experience -I will definitely go to Taipei next time!
工作人員非常自命不凡，除了他們自己之外對任何事情都不感興趣。去一個你的習俗受到讚賞的地方。,"The staff is very extraordinary, and is not interested in anything except them.Go to a place where your custom is appreciated."
11月30日晚上我參觀了Kavalan威士忌酒吧。那位女工作人員非常專業。男服務員在放下食物或上水時需要學習一些禮儀……酒吧的禮儀與當地酒吧的禮儀類似。,"On the evening of November 30, I visited the Kavalan whiskey bar.The female staff member is very professional.Male waiters need to learn some etiquette when putting down food or water ... The etiquette of the bar is similar to the etiquette of the local bar."
我只喝了一杯，但它寬敞又時尚。,"I only drank one cup, but it was spacious and fashionable."
"我喜歡這個地方。
飲料直接從木桶中倒出。專業而友好的員工。還有一個很好的選擇來搭配你的飲料。","I like this place.
The drink is poured directly from the barrel.Professional and friendly employees.There is also a good choice to match your drink."
偉大的。種類很多，可以事先想好要免稅買什麼。令人驚訝的是它是直接從桶子裡倒出來的。,"Great.There are many types, you can think about what you want to buy in advance.Surprisingly, it poured directly from the barrel."
它是直接從桶子倒出來的，這似乎是一個很好的體驗。 3杯套裝不錯！,"It is poured directly from the barrel, which seems to be a good experience.3 cups are good!"
雞尾酒獨特而美味。氣氛也很好。,Cocktails are unique and delicious.The atmosphere is also very good.
"很棒的服務。很棒的雞尾酒。很棒的經驗。最後以一杯免費的威士忌作結。

去了卡瓦蘭威士忌酒吧後，又去了同一地區其他評價很高的酒吧，所有這些酒吧都給我留下了深刻的印象。
這就是卡瑪蘭威士忌吧的魅力所在。","Great service.A great cocktail.Great experience.Finally, a cup of free whiskey was settled.

After going to the Kavan whiskey bar, I went to other bars with high evaluations in the same area, and all these bars were impressed by me.
This is the charm of the Kamaran whiskey bar."
"可以從大樓二樓的烤肉店內部進入！
工作人員很友善，可以用英語點餐。
根據類型的不同，您甚至可以直接從桶中飲用噶瑪蘭！
店內看起來很熱鬧，所以幾個人去也沒問題！
需另加10%服務費！
您可以使用日本發行的信用卡！","You can enter from the barbecue shop on the second floor of the building!
The staff is very friendly and can order in English.
Depending on the type, you can even drink Karma directly from the barrel!
The store looks lively, so there is no problem in a few people!
Add another 10%service fee!
You can use a credit card issued by Japan!"
亞當超級友善而且非常專業！ 超專業哦！溫暖值得嘗試！他們的單桶從桶中倒出的酒讓你有一種身處他們釀酒廠的感覺。氣氛非常涼爽，所有工作人員都非常熱情好客！下次還會再來！,"Adam is super friendly and very professional!Super professional!Warm is worth trying!The wine poured out of the barrel from the barrel makes you feel like they are in their brewery.The atmosphere is very cool, all staff are very enthusiastic hospitality!Will come again next time!"
門不錯，但午夜後就不要再出現了：雖然營業到凌晨 1 點，但中午 12 點之後將不再接受您的訂單。上帝禁止你在凌晨 0.02 點出現！,"The door is good, but after midnight, don't appear again: Although it is open until 1 am, it will no longer accept your order after 12 noon.God prohibits you from appearing at 0.02 in the morning!"
優秀的調酒師，威士忌推薦很完美。嘗試飛行！,"Excellent bartenders, whiskey recommendation is perfect.Try to fly!"
享受噶瑪蘭的好地方。,Enjoy a good place to Karmaland.
顯然，對於有興趣的人來說，精選的噶瑪蘭威士忌值得一去。雞尾酒也非常好，儘管價格相當昂貴。除了入口處的木桶外，內部裝飾沒有什麼令人印象深刻的，而且音樂有點過於夜店風格，不適合這種氣氛。,"Obviously, for those who are interested, the selected Karmaland whiskey is worth visiting.Cocktails are also very good, although the price is quite expensive.Except for the barrels at the entrance, there is no impressive interior decoration, and the music is a bit too much nightclub style, which is not suitable for this atmosphere."
7/14 去過那裡。不錯😊美味的食物,7/14 There.Good 食 delicious food
台北市的一個世外桃源，我們推薦這個地方作為您在台北的最後一站！ ︎,"A paradise in Taipei City, we recommend this place as your last stop in Taipei!Bleak"

喝台灣特色威士忌的特色場所,Drinking Taiwanese characteristic whiskey characteristic places
這是菜單。一張圖說一千個字。這裡的所有雞尾酒都有一個故事。,This is the menu.One thousand words.All cocktails here have a story.
可愛的地方（喜歡音樂選擇），桶裡有很棒的單一麥芽威士忌,"Cute place (like music choice), there are great single malt whiskey in the barrel"
喜歡這個酒吧。在這裡舉辦生日派對！一定要去找調酒師詹姆斯，他調製出有史以來最好/獨特的雞尾酒。,"Like this bar.A birthday party here!Be sure to find the winemaker James, and he prepares the best/unique cocktail ever in history."
