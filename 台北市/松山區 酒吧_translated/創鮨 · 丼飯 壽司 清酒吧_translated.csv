"存了很久的口袋名單，真的不虛此行！

環境很舒適悠閒，生魚片的品質不在話下，每一口都能感受到肉質的鮮美還有油脂散開在口中的香氣。

🔹明太子山藥：掛在牆上的餐點，山藥烤的外酥內軟，明太子用量更是絕，不妨可以嘗試不在菜單上的料理！
🔹酒蒸蛤蜊：蛤蜊鮮甜，酒蒸後的清湯更是絕味，比起味增湯的味道，個人覺得酒蒸的比較好喝。
🔹玉子燒：表層用焦糖炙燒過後，又多一層口感，味道不會太甜也不會太鹹。
🔸燒酎+梅酒：順口好喝，很令人上癮的組合！

"朋友吃過覺得不錯所以帶我們來吃吃看（本人為初訪）。

有發票（可載具）、可刷卡，+10%服務費
位子雖然沒有到很寬敞，但畢竟受限室內坪數問題，屬於可接受的範圍。

老闆們都很熱情、友善，原本以為只有2人可能要稍等一下，但上菜速度比想像中快。

店家有招待海帶豆腐味噌湯及白蘿蔔小菜。

壽司基本上都為一貫。

酒蒸蛤蜊：
蛤蜊大、多且鮮，只是畢竟是酒蒸，所以湯的酒味滿明顯的，可惜個人問題無法喝完。

干貝漢堡加海膽：
干貝漢堡本身120元，可+100加海膽
此款單價較高，當時也猶豫很久，但後來聽老闆說他們家海膽吃起來比較沒腥味（帶甜），所以決定吃吃看（推薦一口吃）。
覺得點了不後悔，吃下去的瞬間感覺回到當時在海邊浮潛的感覺，眼前都要跑出派大星了😂

（我有點的）蔥花鮪魚手捲、焦糖鮭魚壽司、午仔魚壽司、日本獅魚壽司、真鯛壽司：
我覺得都不錯，有一個偏白色魚肉的壽司我滿喜歡的，但忘記是什麼魚了……

另外聽她們說比目魚、紅甘、花枝也好吃，可惜我今天沒點，等下次回訪再嚐嚐看。

手作玉子燒：
頂層有焦糖，吃起來不會太單調。

日本甜蝦：
吃起來不軟爛而且有甜。

山藥明太子：
（本人很愛山藥），山藥是白色的那種，烤得脆脆的挺好咬的，明太子也不會給得吝嗇。

烤麻糬：淋煉乳，為長條片狀，如果表皮能烤到焦脆覺得會更棒。

黑芝麻大理石：
芝麻奶酪，很嫩（搖它會晃動），喜歡，上面還有灑黃豆粉搭配，湯匙是櫻花的樣式覺得很可愛。

3/14晚上吃的餐點都滿喜歡的（覺得沒有雷的），已加入最愛名單內😍
也跟朋友約好下次會再來訪。","My friends have been eating well, so I take us to eat and watch (I am a first visit).

The bosses are very enthusiastic and friendly. Originally, only two people might have to wait a minute, but the speed of serving is faster than expected.

The store has entertaining kelp tofu soup and white radish.

Sushi is basically consistent.

Wine steaming clams:
The clams are large, many, and fresh, but after all, it is steaming, so the soup taste is obvious, but unfortunately the personal problem cannot be finished.

Dry Burger and Sea Bilin:
The scallop burger itself is 120 yuan, which can be +100 plus sea urchin
The unit price was high, and he hesitated for a long time at the time, but later he heard the boss said that their sea urchin was less fishy (with sweet), so I decided to eat it (recommend a bite).
I don't regret it. The moment I eat it, I feel that I feel like a snorkeling at the time of snorkeling at the time of the seaside.

(I have a bit) green onion catfish hand roll, caramel salmon sushi, noon fish sushi, Japanese lion fish sushi, real bream sushi:
I think it's good. I have a white fish sushi. I like it, but I forgot what the fish is ...

In addition, they listen to them say that they are more delicious than fish, red and flower branches, but unfortunately I don't order today, and wait for the next return visit to try it.

Hand -made Yuzi burning:
There are caramel on the top layer, and it will not taste too monotonous.

Japanese sweet shrimp:
It is not soft and sweet.

Prince Yam Ming:
(I love yam very much), the yam is white, and the bakery is crunchy and bite, and the prince Ming will not be stingy.

Baking hemp: Permailing milk, it is a long piece of slices.

Black sesame marble:
Sesame cheese is very tender (shake it will shake). I like it. There are also sprinkled soybean flour with it. The spoon is very cute.

🥣中午點的丼飯有招待味增湯，但不太知道是本來就有附贈還是特別贈送，對於中午點餐的部份仍然有點困惑。（尤其是請客人吃飯不太方便一直詢問店家細節時，如果可以直接多印一張午餐菜單或者點餐前告知會很好）

上星期吃的，是個小店，品項不多，不過幾乎都蠻好吃的，干貝漢堡很新鮮，牡丹蝦頭還會塞一點飯烤過，肉質非常Q彈，酒蒸蛤蜊湯很好喝，還點了山葡萄酒，第一次喝，很不錯，味增湯是送的，感覺裡面有一點點紫蘇味，不知道有沒有喝錯，很清爽又有味道的好喝。除了山藥明太子我吃不慣，不過這是我個人問題，我以為山藥烤完之後會跟馬鈴薯一樣，我錯了🤣。店面小但是用的很乾淨整齊，工作人員不多，可以刷卡，老闆很愛聊天（聽到他跟熟客聊蠻好笑的），菜色可以客製，可以坐在吧台跟老闆點菜，希望之後菜色再多一點。 …,"It was a small shop last week.

"看餐廳評價很高，很期待想去嘗試，提早訂5:30，到場已經快客滿，菜單很簡單，老公最近腸胃不好，想點一些熟食，我們坐在吧台，請問師傅熟食有那些可以點，師傅也許很忙，不耐煩的回答：我們這裡全部都是生食，沒有熟食，我和老公面面相覷，還是把菜單和牆上貼的紙條看了個遍，然後點了炙燒鮭魚丼，烤鮭魚下巴，干貝漢堡，酒蒸蛤蜊湯，天使蝦壽司，大部分都是熟的，吃完這些還是沒飽，看到菜單有花枝壽司40元一個，老公想吃手捲，問吧台師傅可以做成手捲嗎？師傅回答，做成手捲是特製一個要 100 元，我們說好，餐後還點了招牌布丁，餐點都不錯吃，食材也很新鮮，可是怎麼走出餐廳，二人都覺得心情不太好，昨晚我居然做夢跟餐廳老闆吵架🥵，想提醒店家，雖然店裡只有一位師傅和一位服務員真的很忙碌，但我們是第一次去，對描述簡單的菜單，並不太了解，詢問時
希望店家能口氣和善一點，而且真的都是生食嗎？那我們點的烤魚下巴，酒蒸蛤蜊湯都是生的嗎？😨😨

後記： 看到店家的回覆，我真的莫名非常，只是吃一餐飯本不想糾結，但店家的回覆，我決定要澄清當天原貌：

1. 當天已經快客滿，店裡只有一位服務人員，服務員只把菜單拿給我們並沒有跟我們做介紹，我把手機截圖詢問推薦菜色，他應該太忙了，就叫我們先看菜單。

2. 之後我詢問吧台，因為也只有一位主廚，我說：請問有熟食嗎？也許是太忙，他的態度另我驚訝（因為沒遇過）他說： 我們這裡都是生食，沒有熟食，怎麼店家是回應：大部分是生食，吧台師傅明明說：只有生食，請注意差一個字差很多

3. 當下我們也默默的看遍紙本和牆上貼的菜單，才點了烤魚和蛤蜊湯之類，除了點餐，完全沒有和吧台師傅交流，我是在評論區表達我的疑問，明明是有熟食的，怎麼說我是刁難呢？ 再次強調：吧台師傅是說，（只有生食，沒有熟食）

4. 本來當天沒有要寫評論，隔天真的做了一個和老闆吵架的夢，我不知道這是不是和昨天晚餐有關，是因為這樣才想給店家建議，雖然很忙，請對新來的客人態度和善一點，食物雖然好吃，不善的口氣，也會給客人帶來壓力

5. 最後就是我們是陌生人，不需要店家給建議，叫我們以後不要吃日式料理，我們吃不吃是我們的自由，店家的言外之意就不是在刁難嗎？如此沒有檢討的回覆，真是坐實了：此地無銀三百兩","Looking at the restaurant's evaluation is very high, I am looking forward to trying to try it. I booked 5:30 early. It is almost full of the scene. The menu is very simple. My husband has a bad stomach recently. We want to order some cooked food. We sit on the bar. Click, the master may be very busy and impatiently answer: All of us here are raw food, there is no cooked food, and my husband and I look at each other. I still look at the note and the note on the wall, and then ordered the roasted salmon. Roasted salmon chin, dried scallops burger, wine steamed clam soup, angel shrimp sushi, most of them are cooked. After eating these, I still have 40 yuan per flower sushi. My husband wants to eat hand rolls. Is it a hand roll?The master answered that it is a specially made of 100 yuan for making a hand scroll. We said yes. After the meal, we ordered the signature pudding. The meals were good and the ingredients were fresh. Last night I dreamed that I quarreled with the restaurant owner. I wanted to remind the store that although only one master and a waiter in the store were really busy, but for the first time, we did not know much about the simple menu. When inquiring
I hope that the store can tone a better breath, and is it really food?Then we ordered the roasted fish chin, is the steamed clam soup raw?Bleak

Postscript: Seeing the reply of the store, I was really inexplicable, but I did n’t want to tangle a meal, but the reply from the store, I decided to clarify the original appearance of the day:

1. It was almost full that day. There was only one service staff in the store. The waiter only gave us the menu and did not introduce it to us. I asked the screenshot of the mobile phone to ask the recommended dishes. He should be too busy. Essence

2. After that, I asked the bar, because there was only one chef. I said: Is there a cooked food?Maybe it's too busy, and my attitude is surprised (because I haven't encountered it). He said: We are all raw food here. There is no cooked food. How can the shop respond: Most of them are raw food. A lot of words

3. At present, we also silently look at the menu and the menu posted on the wall before ordering grilled fish and clam soup. Except for ordering, I did not communicate with the master of the bar. I expressed my doubts in the comment area. Obviously there is cooked food, how can I make it difficult?Once again: the master of the bar is saying, (only raw food, no cooked food)

4. I did n’t want to write a comment that day. I really made a dream of quarreling with the boss the next day. I don’t know if this is related to the dinner last yesterday. It is because I want to give the store suggestion. The attitude of the guests is more kind. Although the food is delicious and a bad tone, it will also put pressure on the guests

5. Finally, we are strangers. We do n’t need a store to give suggestions. We do n’t need to eat Japanese cuisine in the future. Is it our freedom to eat or not?There is no reply to the review, it is really true: There are no silver in this place, three hundred or two silver",False

Ordered salmon sashimi slices of rice, holding sushi, prince yam, and tea bowl steaming, each of which is above the standard, especially the scallops small burger. Although it takes 120, it is really sweet and fresh!If girls are full about 500 (if they have no drink)

服務100分，朋友約的但我不敢吃生食，老闆很有耐心跟我說熟食的餐點，還有招待味增湯跟小鮭魚，甜點烤麻糬很好吃，照片中為2份的份量。,"The service is 100 points, but my friend's appointment, but I dare not eat raw food. The boss has the patience to tell me the meal for cooked food, as well as entertaining the flavor and salmon, and the dessert grilled hemp. Essence",False
"在週五的晚上找開到比較晚的壽司店的時候發現這家店，沒想到會留下這麼美好的體驗，
首先價格非常親民，生魚片也非常新鮮，
綜合握壽司中的每一貫都非常有特色，
也能各別的選擇是否要炙燒，
生魚片上會巧妙的運用松露、金桔等點綴，
讓整個食材的美味再昇華了一個層次，

接著是海膽，這裡的馬糞海膽非常令人驚艷，
完全吃不到一絲一毫的腥味，
一進到口內會先品嘗到新鮮的甜味，
再來是有如牛奶般的濃密感整個包覆著舌頭，
不斷刺激味蕾，令人回味無窮，

最後這道干貝漢堡 加 馬糞海膽，
是我這輩子到目前為止吃過最好吃的東西，
首先從外觀上看到就知道師傅這道料理的用心程度，在海膽的表面除了松露以外，
還使用金箔來點綴，
一進入口中就會先嚐到濃濃的松露味，
再來是馬糞海膽的鮮甜濃稠，
主角干貝非常的鮮嫩新鮮，入口即化，
而它稱作漢堡的原因，我想就是他兩片疊起來的干貝中間，還有蟹膏及蟹肉作為內餡，
蟹膏及蟹肉的鮮味在最後爆射出來，
但與其他食材之間又取得了一個完美的平衡，
彼此交融之間，能感受到每個食材的味道，
又能嚐到食材融合之後那更高級的美味，
在品嚐的過程中久久不能自已，說不出話，
吃完之後還彷彿能感受到干貝的鮮嫩，
真的是我吃過最好吃的東西

感謝兩位老闆，人都非常的nice，
會主動介紹菜色，也可以讓客人自行選擇要炙燒或是生食，這次還招待我們味噌湯以及烤鯖魚下巴，
以後會常來回顧，希望這家這麼棒的店能被更多人看到！！","When I found a late sushi restaurant on Friday night, I found this shop. I did not expect to leave such a beautiful experience.
First of all, the price is very close to the people, and raw fish fillets are also very fresh.
Every consistent in comprehensive sushi is very distinctive,
You can also choose whether to burn each other,
The sashimi will be clever on the sashimi.
The deliciousness of the entire ingredients has been sublimated at a level,

Then there is sea urchin, the horseshow sea urchin here is very amazing,
Can't eat the slightest fishy at all,
As soon as you enter your mouth, you will taste the fresh sweetness first,
Then there is a strong sense of milk like milk. The whole tongue is covered,
Continuous stimulation of taste buds, which is endless,

Finally, this dried scallop burger plus horse dung sea urchin,
It's the best thing I have ever eaten so far in my life,
First of all, when you see the appearance, you can know the degree of intention of the master's cuisine. In addition to the surface of the sea urchin, in addition to truffle,
Also use gold foil to embellish,
As soon as you enter your mouth, you will taste the thick truffle flavor first,
Then there is the freshness and thickness of the horseshow sea urchin,
The protagonist's scallops are very fresh and fresh, and the entrance is melted.
And the reason why it is called a burger, I think it is the middle of his two pieces of scallops, as well as crab paste and crab meat as the filling.
The umami flavor of crab paste and crab meat burst out at the end,
But a perfect balance between other ingredients,
By blending with each other, you can feel the taste of each ingredient,
After the fusion of the ingredients, you can taste the more advanced deliciousness,
I ca n’t help myself in the process of tasting, I ca n’t speak,
After eating it, it seems that I can feel the tenderness of scallops,
It's really the best thing I have ever eaten

Thanks to the two bosses, the people are very nice.
I will take the initiative to introduce the dishes, and let the guests choose to burn or eat raw. This time, we also entertain our miso soup and grilled catfish chin.
I will often look back in the future. I hope that this great store can be seen by more people!Intersection",False
