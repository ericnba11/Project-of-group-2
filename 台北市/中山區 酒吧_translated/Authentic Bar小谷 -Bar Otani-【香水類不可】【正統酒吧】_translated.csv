超級喜歡！ 第一次去這麼安靜，沒有播音樂的店，只有一些水聲跟器皿的聲音，而且店內香香的，入座後很放鬆，就算沒有品酒經驗也推薦來，老闆蠻好聊的，可以依據酸、甜、苦、辣，濃厚、清爽等讓老闆調製，目前最喜歡酸的然後是辣的，味道豐富，加上冰塊慢慢地享受味道的變化，期待下一次到訪,"I really like it!The first time I went to such a quiet, no music broadcast, there were only some sounds of water sounds and utensils, and the incense in the store was very relaxed after seating. Even if there was no wine tasting experience, I was recommended. Sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, strong, refreshing, etc. The boss is prepared. At present, the most likely sour one is spicy, rich in taste, and the ice cubes slowly enjoy the change of taste. I look forward to the next visit to the next visit."
"店內極度要求音量放低，燈光昏暗，沒有酒單，直接跟老闆形容你想喝的酒/風味/食材，成果無比滿意，芒果搭配泥煤味威士忌非常驚艷，百香果風味的也很驚人
————-
二訪依舊滿意","The volume in the store is extremely low, the lights are dim, and there is no wine list. It directly describes the wine/flavor/ingredients you want to drink with the boss.
——————
The second visit is still satisfied"
"來了不少次了
總而言之非常推薦
一組客人最多兩位
每人低消800（隔天是上班日的話）
經典調酒可以說是非常的好喝","A lot of times have been here
All are very recommended
There are two groups of guests with a maximum of two guests
Each person eliminates 800 (the next day is the case of work day)
Classic bartending can be said to be very delicious"
"非常安靜享受的夜晚 適合獨自靜靜品飲
小谷先生內斂親切

隔一年二訪
以經典調酒為主 每日也看情況有不同的水果原汁當原料 小谷先生也會使用台灣市面不常見的日本利口酒們 風味很棒~
店內很安靜沒有音樂 只能輕聲說話 燈光昏暗 很適合1-2人慢慢品嘗~","The night that is very quiet and enjoyable is suitable for drinking alone
Mr. Kobaya is restrained and kind

Visiting every two year
The classic bartending is the main fruit daily. Different fruits are raw juice. Mr. Kobayashi, raw materials, will also use the uncommon Japanese liquor in Taiwan.
The store is very quiet without music, but you can speak softly. The light is dim. It is suitable for 1-2 people to taste slowly ~"
很特別的一間BAR，其實很適合一個人來喝酒放空想事情，這次點草莓調酒好喝，杯裡聞得到草莓香，喝到草莓籽，像是加入現榨草莓進去酒裡調味。店內沒有音樂、燈光其暗，下班後來喝兩杯放鬆很不錯！,"A very special bar, in fact, it is very suitable for a person to drink and think about things. This time, strawberries are delicious, and the strawberry fragrance can be smelled in the cup.There is no music or light in the store, and it is very good to drink two glasses after work after get off work!"
"非常隱密而且氣氛獨特的無酒單小Bar。在穿過老大樓內的一樓矮門之後馬上可以感受到一種都會中難以尋覓的靜謐感。

老闆是日本人（蠻多客人也是），不過點酒上的溝通並不會太困難，對雞尾酒稍有認識的人可以直接指定酒種或品牌，也可以直接告知想要的酸甜苦口味、酒感、濃度、元素，老闆也會直接量身客製，並且在遞上酒時把主要挑選的酒一併展示。

店內的氣氛相對一般酒吧的熱鬧氣氛來說是比較迴異的，第一次步入可能會被寧靜的空間嚇到不太敢說話，連音樂都是沒有的。不過如果空間內有另一組人開始低聲聊天之後就比較沒那麼衝擊了www 當然這也跟不接待一組超過兩位的客人政策有關係。

Bar小谷的酒真的很棒，推薦給想放鬆一下，給自己尋找片刻寧靜和微醺的人。","Very hidden and unique atmosphere.After passing through the dwarf door on the first floor of the old building, you can immediately feel a sense of tranquility that is difficult to find.

The boss is Japanese (there are many guests), but the communication on the wine is not too difficult. Those who know a little about cocktails can directly specify the wine species or brand, or to tell the sweetness and bitter taste of the desired. The wine feel, concentration, and elements, the boss will also be tailor -made directly, and it will be displayed together to show the main selection of wine when handing the wine.

The atmosphere in the store is relatively different from the lively atmosphere of the bar. The first time you can step into the tranquility space, you don't even dare to speak, not even music.However, if there is another group of people in the space, it is less impacting WwW. Of course, this is also related to not receiving a group of more than two guest policies.

Bar Kobaya's wine is really great. It is recommended to relax and find people who want to relax and find themselves quiet and slightly."
"日式的服務風格，氣氛十分幽靜，
經典調酒令人驚艷！！","Japanese -style service style, the atmosphere is very quiet,
Classic bartending is amazing!Intersection"
今天真的趕時間無法待太久 不然一個人來真的很推,I really ca n’t stay for too long today
怎麼說呢？很個人風的一家調酒Bar，無酒單，限時消費時間，一個人低消800，基本上每人必須要點兩杯酒，金額要等結帳時開獎才知道，整家店小小沒有甚麼裝潢，也沒有甚麼燈光，黑到你連隔壁桌客人都看不清楚，講話必須輕聲，交頭接耳耳邊說，適合曖昧情侶升溫，肢體接觸專武用，這算優點嗎？🤣 …,"What do you say?A very personal style of bartending BAR, no wine list, time -limited consumption time, one person eliminates 800 lows, basically everyone must order two glasses of wine, the amount has to wait for the award at the checkout. There is no lighting in the decoration. It is so black that you can't even see the guests of the next table. The speech must be softly whispered. It is suitable for ambiguous couples to heat up and use physical contact for specialty. Is this advantage?🤣 🤣 ..."
"沒有菜單，直接向老闆描述想要的酒，每杯酒都很有水準，血腥瑪麗更是好喝。
店內很黑，小聲交談，不能超過二人、不能噴香水。","Without a menu, he described the desired wine directly to the boss. Each glass of wine is very standard, and the bloody Mary is even more delicious.
The shop is very dark, and talked in whispering. It cannot exceed two people or spray perfume."
適合獨自前往的日式酒吧。氛圍舒適，安靜但不壓抑。看著小谷先生調酒，十分享受。三杯飲品皆十分細緻，尤其喜歡第一杯的苦甜調酒及第三杯的white Negroni 。,"Suitable for Japanese -style bars alone.The atmosphere is comfortable, quiet but not depressed.Looking at Mr. Kobaya's bartender, he enjoyed it very much.Three cups of drinks are very detailed, especially like the first cup of bitter sweet bartending and the third cup of White Negroni."
"隱身在林森北路巷弄裡的個性小店。
店裡的規矩就放在門口牆上，不能大聲喧嘩，不接受三人以上團體客人，同意方可入內，低矮的拉門讓每位客人都必須彎腰低頭才能踏進店裡，由此可見老闆的個性，不過這種日本職人特有的執拗和堅持並不惹人厭，反倒優雅地讓人覺得有些欽佩。
第一次踏進店裡的時候有些被裡頭幾乎伸手不見五指的幽暗嚇到，唯一的光源是每張座位桌前的小夜燈，在黑暗中隱隱透著微光。
店裡無酒單，想喝什麼要和老闆溝通，雖然老闆是日本人，但基本的中文溝通完全沒有問題，之後老闆會在客人面前親自調製飲料，老闆的手藝優雅細膩，安靜而不過分喧嘩，一如店裡的裝潢和氛圍。
唯一的缺點是店裡沒有洗手間，想上廁所必須要去外頭大廈社區的有些骯髒老舊的公共廁所，雖然不至於無法接受，但總會讓剛從店裡出來的人有種回到現實的感覺，有些掃興。
不過整體而言這還是一間十分值得一來再來的個性小酒吧，如果你在尋找一兩個人安靜喝酒的地方，千萬不要錯過這裡。","Hidden in a personality shop in Lane Lane Lane Lane Lane Road.
The rules in the store are placed on the door of the door. You cannot make a loud noise. You do not accept the group guests of more than three people. You can only enter the inside. It can be seen that the personality of the boss is not annoyed by the unique persistence and persistence of this Japanese staff, but it makes people feel a little admired.
When I stepped into the store for the first time, I was scared by the darkness that almost reached out and could not see the five fingers. The only light source was the night light in front of each seat table, which was faintly light in the darkness.
There is no wine list in the store. What you want to drink to communicate with the boss. Although the boss is Japanese, there is no problem with basic Chinese communication. After that, the boss will prepare the drink in front of the guests. The boss's craftsmanship is elegant and delicate. Just like the decoration and atmosphere in the store.
The only disadvantage is that there is no toilet in the store. If you want to go to the toilet, you must go to the dirty and old public toilets in the community of the outside building. It feels a bit dismissal.
But overall, this is still a very worthwhile bar that is worthwhile again. If you are looking for a place where one or two people drink quietly, don't miss this."
比起其它把酒用得假鬼假怪的酒吧，這家的酒非常有誠意，裡面要輕聲細語，也沒有音樂，彷彿要你專心品酒就好，另外老闆不會幫你幫你決定口味，要什麼就自己講，不能說不知道你推薦😂 整體感受蠻特別的，會帶朋友來試試看，一次最多只能兩個人。,"Compared to other bars that use wine as fake ghosts, this wine is very sincere. It has to whisper softly, and there is no music, as if you want you to focus on wine. In addition, the boss will help you decide the taste. If you want, you can say what you want. You ca n’t say that you do n’t know that you recommend that the overall feeling is quite special. You will take friends to try it. At one time, you can only have two people."
"照片第二張
是讓我最驚豔的第二杯
泥煤威士忌、生薑利口酒、番茄
最後撒上梅粉
嗅覺感混著泥煤與番茄的草味
像是走進來果園
味覺上帶有的鹹甜酸
讓泥煤味順口卻不失本色

老闆表示日式酒吧的精神，是希望酒精更重，但喝起來像水一樣順。
除了對融水量的掌握，基酒的搭配也很厲害，真的好喝！","Photo second
It is the second cup that makes me the most amazing
Patty whiskey, ginger liquor, tomato
Finally sprinkle plum powder
The sense of smell is mixed with the grass smell of peat and tomato
It's like walking into the orchard
The salty sweet and sour on the taste
Let the mud flavor go well without losing the color

The boss said that the spirit of Japanese -style bars is to hope that alcohol is heavier, but it is as smooth as water.
In addition to the mastery of the amount of water melting, the matching of base wine is also very good, it is really delicious!"
"［一個很神秘又安靜的bar］
當你一個人又很想喝酒，來這邊就沒錯了!
可以不受打擾也不用在意別人眼光
因為裡面很暗很暗誰也看不清誰～
日式調酒蠻特別的，調完bartender還會把使用的酒擺放到客人面前。
是個很舒服自在的地方。","[A very mysterious and quiet bar]
When you want to drink alone, it's right to come here!
You can not care about it without being disturbed
Because it is very dark and dark, who can't see anyone ~
Japanese -style bartending is quite special, and Bartender will also put the wine used in front of the guests.
It's a very comfortable place."
"入店前請先看看門口的說明，老闆大概不太希望店內太吵XD，所以注意事項大家就入境隨俗配合囉。不過老闆是很親切的哦！
店內氣氛真的蠻安靜的，顧客大多都是一人，沒怎麼交談，就是單純的來喝酒。想喝什麼樣的類型都可以跟老闆(日本人)說，簡單的中文沒問題，調好的酒也會把材料放在面前給大家參考。調酒部分喝得出來老闆的功力。單純想喝幾杯時可以來這碰碰運氣(不能訂位)，會再訪的店。","Before entering the store, please look at the instructions at the door. The boss probably does not hope that the store is too noisy XD, so the precautions are cooperated with the custom as you enter the country.But the boss is very kind!
The atmosphere in the store is really quiet. Most of the customers are one person. They do n’t talk much. They simply drink.You can tell the boss (Japanese) what kind of type you want to drink. Simple Chinese is no problem. The adjustable wine will also put the ingredients in front of you for your reference.The alcoholic part can drink the skill of the boss.When you want to drink a few glasses, you can come here to touch your luck (you can't book a position), and you will visit the shop again."
調酒有一個調酒師想要呈現的獨特風格 是從一般經典調酒裡調出偏bourbon風味的味道，酒不錯喝，一杯大約450元，只是裡面是在太暗幾乎黑暗 沒有音樂 遮板遮得有點像監獄有點壓迫感。屬於酒好喝但環境普通的酒吧然後價錢是台北市高單價的價位,调酒有一个调酒师想要呈现的独特风格是从一般经典调酒里调出偏bourbon风味的味道，酒不错喝，一杯大约450元，只是里面是在太暗几乎黑暗没有音乐遮板遮It is a bit like a prison.Bar that belongs to the wine that is good but the environment is ordinary and the price is the price of the high unit price of Taipei City
每一杯調酒味道都很淡雅，融水量都很講究，呈現出很棒的經典調酒，即興的創意調酒也能符合客人需求，尤其是芒果跟泥煤威士忌的搭配真的一絕,"Each cup of bartender tastes very elegant, and the amount of water melts is very particular. It presents a great classic bartending. The improvisation of creative bartending can also meet the needs of guests. Especially the mango and muddy whiskey combination is really a must"
"非常推薦的酒吧，適合1-2個人前往。
Bar小谷是日式酒吧，店內非常暗也很安靜，可以講話但真的要壓低聲音喔。
很多人是1人前往，很適合喝喝酒想事情，沈澱自己再出發的酒吧。

低消是800元（2杯調酒，1杯400）。
店家沒有酒單，跟小谷講你想要的風味跟酒感即可。
比較推薦他們的作品水果跟經典的調酒系列。
New York, Sidecar都很優秀。

小谷人非常好，調酒技術無庸置疑。第一次來可能會害怕是沈默寡言的嚴格老闆，但實際上是非常友善的人。

店內位子不多，有機會可以進來試試看，喝杯好酒沈澱自己。","A very recommended bar, suitable for 1-2 people.
BAR Komatsu is a Japanese -style bar. The shop is very dark and quiet. You can speak but really low your voice.
Many people go to one person. It is very suitable for drinking and wanting things, and precipitates the bar where they set off again.

The low is 800 yuan (2 cups of wine, 1 cup 400).
The store does not have a wine list, just tell Kobaya you can feel the flavor and wine you want.
It is more recommended for their work fruit and classic bartending series.
New York and Sidecar are excellent.

The Kobayashi people are very good, and the bartending technology is unquestionable.For the first time, I may be afraid of the strict boss who is silent, but it is actually a very friendly person.

There are not many seats in the store. You can come in and try to drink a good wine."
"Bartender 夜晚的諮商師
選擇個人喜好的口味，調和出一杯屬於自己的味道⋯
同樣的酸、同樣的濃，卻杯杯都精彩，沒有重複的味道～

此店沒有音樂，屬於安靜的日式酒吧⋯
品嚐著屬於當下的心情良藥","Bartender at night consultant
Choose the taste of personal preferences, blend a cup of your own taste ...
The same acidity and the same thick, but the cups are wonderful, there is no repeated taste ~

There is no music in this shop, it belongs to a quiet Japanese bar ...
Taste the good medicine that belongs to the present"
一兩人，靜靜喝杯調酒的好地方，老闆規矩多不喜歡喧嘩，有著好手藝能隨性品味，意外的靜謐之所,"One or two people, drink a good place to drink a glass of bartending, the boss does not like the noise, has good handicapytables and tastes, unexpectedly quiet places."
極有質感的調酒，極低光安靜的吧，只招待兩人內的客人，想喝什麼都能問問老闆~💕 …,"The textured bartender, extremely low light and quiet, only entertain the guests in the two people, you can ask the boss if you want to drink anything ~ 💕 ..."
"一個極簡風的昏暗日式酒吧
店內只有一排長吧台桌，約10個席位
為避免不必要的文化差異糾紛，
老闆特別把rule清楚寫在店外及網頁上
希望來店消費的客人也能以尊重的態度面對，你一定也能得到相對應禮貌的回饋

今天點了四杯經典調酒
1.Silent third
2.Side car
3.Negroni
4.Alaska （green)
每一杯都相當有水準！

尤其Side car應該是我經驗品到最優質的！
摒棄人頭馬/軒尼斯+君度；
老闆選用了bisquit COGNAC的白蘭地 與
SAUMUR的橙酒，調出來的side car竟完全沒有任何不平衡與惱人的尖銳酒感或檸檬酸感！
讓人只想一口接一口的快速喝完，真的太好喝了

在喝酒並與老闆的對談之中
也學到了許多日本式對於調酒與其他bar的不同見解，也讓我見識到日本bartender追求精確、完美的那種職人精神

今天真是一個完美的夜晚！

店當然也有小小缺點是
1.廁所在外面與其他店家共用，清潔程度普而已
2.店內沒有供水作chaser,要付費買瓶裝礦泉水

以這樣的調酒品質來說
價錢上絕對是談不上貴的；
四杯經典調酒加一瓶水，結帳是1700大洋
（店好像不收一成服務費）
供諸君參考","A minimalist Japanese -style bar
There is only a row of long bar table in the store, about 10 seats
To avoid unnecessary cultural differences disputes,
The boss clearly wrote Rule on the outside of the store and on the webpage
I hope that the guests who come to the store can also face with a respectful attitude, and you will definitely get a relatively polite feedback

I ordered four cups of classic bartending today
1.SILENT Third
2. side car
3.negroni
4.Alaska (Green)
Every cup is quite standard!

In particular, SIDE CAR should be the highest quality of my experience!
Abandon the head and horse/Hennis+Jun Du;
The boss chose Bailan land and
SAUMUR's orange wine, the SIDE CAR that has been mixed out has no unbalanced and annoying concept or citrate sore at all!
It makes people just want to drink it one by one, it ’s really delicious

Drinking and talking with the boss
I have also learned the different opinions of many Japanese styles on bartending and other bar, and also made me see that the pursuit of accurate and perfection of the pursuit of accurate and perfect jobs in Japan

Today is a perfect night!

Of course, the store also has a small disadvantage.
1. The toilet is externally shaped with other stores.
2. There is no water supply in the store as a chaser, pay to buy bottles of mineral water

For this kind of alcoholic quality
The price is definitely not expensive;
Four cups of classic bartending plus a bottle of water, the checkout is 1700 oceans
(The store does not seem to charge a service fee)
For the reference"
喝酒的好地方，作品很有水準，會自己進一些日本產的酒，可以跟老闆聊聊酒、聊聊美食、聊聊酒吧(進而認識一些不錯的店），只是想買醉、找地方跟好友喧鬧的人，拜託不要來,"For a good place to drink, the work is very standard. I will enter some Japanese wines by themselves. You can talk to the boss about wine, talk about food, and talk about bars (then know some good shops). Noisy person, please don't come"
"這是我安放靈魂的酒吧
也是我追尋的神之杯所在

有人問我最喜歡哪間酒吧
我會回答：我是小谷的客人
帶著驕傲而且誠摯

這是個讓人專心品味調酒味道的地方
未必很輕鬆的
因為調酒師灌注心力與人生的調酒
也該被同等珍視

我以前會再回家洗過澡後
換上乾淨的衣服再去拜訪

如果你是愛酒人
那這是我非常推薦的酒吧
你不用精通酒類知識或是會調酒
但你可以抱持著對酒的喜愛跟敬意
試著讀懂每一杯酒背後想告訴你的故事

對日式調酒師來說
那可能是替你量身打造的
只說給你聽的故事

Ps: 寫於疫情期間

這是我非常喜歡的店
我人生中開心的時刻 難過的時刻
我都會來這裡
當你來第二次之後
你會發現無論你怎麼點 怎麼喝
喝到的都讓你覺得很喜歡

因應疫情 這裡座位間隔拉開
而且要求除了喝酒的期間以外
都要戴著口罩😷
店裡感覺也一直都很乾淨
我想是很安全的店家

我一直都覺得
在台北喝酒的人如果沒來過小谷
不算是有喝過酒
而如果有人說他喜歡小谷的酒
對我來說就像知己一樣

這是我最愛的酒吧
無論世事如何紛擾
無論疫情如何沈重
我都得來這裡
讓自己開心 也安放自己的靈魂","This is the bar I put on the soul
Also the Cup I pursued

Someone asked me which bar I like best
I will answer: I am the guest of Kobayashi
With pride and sincerity

This is a place that makes people concentrate on taste alcoholic taste
Not very easy
Because the bartender pours the heart and the bartender of life
It should also be cherished

I used to go home and take a bath again
Put on clean clothes and then visit

If you are a lover
So this is the bar I recommend very much
You don't have to be proficient in alcohol knowledge or can bartender
But you can hold your love and respect for wine
Try to understand the story behind every glass of wine wants to tell you

For Japanese bartender
That may be tailor -made for you
Just tell the story to you

PS: Write in the epidemic period

This is the shop I like very much
The time when I am happy in my life
I will come here
When you come for a second time
You will find no matter how you order and drink
What you drink makes you feel like it

In response to the epidemic, the seat interval here is opened
And it is required to be except for drinking
We must wear a mask 着
The store feels very clean
I think it's a very safe shop

I always think
People who drink alcohol in Taipei have not been to Kobayashi
Didn't you have a drink
And if someone says he likes Komana's wine
It's like a confidant for me

This is my favorite bar
No matter how the world is disturbed
No matter how heavy the epidemic
I have to come here
Make yourself happy and place your soul"
"很適合一個人安靜放鬆的喝杯調酒
調酒水準極高
一開始踏進bar 老闆看起來很嚴肅
但實際上很Nice
把你想喝的告訴他 他都能夠完美的呈現","It is very suitable for a person to drink a glass of drinking quietly
High alcoholic level
At first, I stepped into the boss of BAR and looked very serious
But it is actually nice
Tell him what you want to drink, he can perfectly present"
隱身在巷弄中的寧靜酒吧，只差一道門彷彿兩個世界一樣，酒吧內只有小夜燈點綴，十足令人放鬆，少人數可以來的無菜單酒吧，只要你對老闆說濃、淡、酸、甜、苦、還有基底酒老闆就可以變出令你滿意的調酒，也別忘了記得要點兩杯以上才有過低消歐～可以獨自沈醉在自己的世界的好地方。,"The quiet bar in the alley, only one door is like two worlds. There are only small night lights in the bar, which is full of relaxation. , Sweet, bitter, bitter, and base wine bosses can change the bartending that satisfies you. Don't forget to remember to order more than two cups before you have a low consumption. You can get intoxicated in your own world."
"Bar小谷很適合來談戀愛，或是和曖昧對象約會過幾次然後想要快速升溫的地方，原因是非常黑又非常安靜，但那種安靜卻又像是不尷尬的輕身細語。

店本身有時候沒開，可能要碰碰運氣前往，建議2人前往，因為位置數真的不多，而且要到齊才能入座。

小谷很酷，他每一杯酒都會問你喜歡的風味再幫你調制，以我自己來說，我目前都滿喜歡的，比方說特制的紫蘇風味的Gin Negroni.

非常推薦和曖昧對象一起來的Bar 小谷，誠心推薦！","BAR Kobaya is very suitable for falling in love, or dating a few times with the ambiguous objects and who wants to rise rapidly. The reason is very dark and quiet, but the quiet but not embarrassing lightly language.

Sometimes the store itself is not open, and you may have to run out of luck. It is recommended that two people go because the number of positions is really not much, and you can take the seat before you can take it.

Kobaya is cool. Each glass of wine will ask you the flavor you like to help you modify it. For myself, I am currently like it. For example, the special purple flavor Gin Negroni.

Bar Komaguy, who is very recommended with the ambiguous object, sincerely recommends!"

"很有個性的酒吧！隱身在住宅大樓一樓，要稍加留意入口。

整體風格很日式，入口處有注意事項，記得詳閱且同意後再入內。

室內空間很昏暗，很有隱密的氣氛，我個人覺得滿放鬆，很適合來喝一杯，但不能太吵鬧就是了。

調酒口味個人覺得中等，不到太令人驚艷，但整體來說是間舒服的小酒吧！","Very individual bar!Hidden on the first floor of the residential building, pay a little attention to the entrance.

The overall style is very Japanese. There are precautions at the entrance. Remember to read it for details and agree.

I personally feel that the taste of the bartender is medium. It is not too amazing, but overall is a comfortable little bar!"
"非常喜歡😍 超適合一個人安安靜靜的去喝酒，也不會有吵鬧或是莫名其妙的人。

如果你是老饕，這裡是台北市喝調酒最有儀式感的酒吧了！沒有過分熱情或是喜歡抬槓的 bartender，沒有 drum and bass 的潮流音樂，沒有潮男女把酒吧當伸展台做精品火力展示，這裡只有安靜默默欣賞不同酒精對話的滿足，幾乎每晚都被懂喝的客人坐滿，你還懷疑嗎 😉 …,"If you are an old lady, this is the most ritual bar in Taipei City!Bartender, who is not too enthusiastic or likes to lift the bar, does not have the trend music of Drum and Bass, and there are no trendy men and women to show the bar as an extended station for a fine firepower display. Only the satisfaction of different alcohol dialogue is quietly appreciated. The guest is full, do you still doubt ..."
"很舒服安靜的酒吧，整間店超暗😂，跟平常去的非常不同，可以專心體會調酒的味道
很喜歡這邊的酒，味道很有層次 …","Very comfortable and quiet bar, the whole shop is ultra -dark, which is very different from usual. You can concentrate on the taste of bartending
I really like the wine here, the taste is very layered ..."
"這是間位在條通舊式大樓裡很酷的日式酒吧，整間店烏漆抹黑僅有微弱的燈光，冰塊和酒液的碰撞聲是店內最肆無忌憚的聲響。Bar小谷無酒單、無供餐食、沒有音樂、不接受預約、不接待超過2人的團體。在這微光、低音量的環境氛圍，相當適合細細品味每杯酒的韻味🍸

由於沒有酒單，點酒時可以向老闆小谷先生直接點想喝的調酒；在店內觀察到大部分的情況是，客人會與小谷先生討論想喝的口味與基酒，小谷先生再根據客人提供的喜好客製化調酒。調酒製作前，也會先跟客人確認將使用的基酒並說明基酒富含的調性與風味，上酒後會將使用的調酒材料一瓶瓶擺放在客人的座位跟前，製作的調酒相當有水準。覺得這次的造訪是個相當有趣的體驗，值得再訪。店內只有９個座位，到訪時還有沒有位置就只能碰碰運氣了。

初訪：
這次依序點了 Gin Tonic、Vesper Martini 、White Negroni、Last Word","This is a cool Japanese -style bar in the old -fashioned building. The whole shop has only weak lights. The collision of ice cubes and wine liquid is the most unscrupulous sound in the shop.Bar Kobaya has no wine list, no meals, no music, no reservation, and no more than two people.In this environmental atmosphere of light and low volume, it is quite suitable for the charm of each glass of wine.

Because there is no wine list, when you order wine, you can directly order the bartender that Mr. Kobayashi wants to drink. Most of the situations are observed in the store. The guests will discuss the taste and base wine they want to drink with Mr. Kobaya. The preferences provide customized bartending.Before the bartending production, it will also confirm with the guests to confirm the tone and flavor of the base wine used and explain the richness and flavor of the base wine. After the wine is put on the wine, the bartender used in the wine will be placed in front of the guest's seat. The bartender is quite standard.I think this visit is a very interesting experience and it is worth visiting.There are only 9 seats in the store, and there is only a place where you can only touch your luck when you visit.

Initial visit:
This time, I ordered Gin Tonic, Vesper Martini, White Negroni, Last Word"
"安靜的空間，且店內無過多照明，不會看到旁邊人的臉，令人非常放鬆。
調酒也讓人非常滿意。","The quiet space, and there are many lighting in the store, and you will not see the face of the people next to them, which is very relaxed.
Blooming is also very satisfactory."
對於調酒有很不一樣的體驗，下次來臺北一定再找時間來訪！,"There is a very different experience for bartending, and next time I come to Taipei to find a time to visit!"
"適合喜歡安靜昏暗的朋友
用的酒有些不常看到
可以跟小谷先生聊天，本人很和善","Suitable for friends who like quiet and dim
The wine used is a bit uninteresting
I can chat with Mr. Kobayashi, I am very kind"
個性小店，調酒水準很高非常好喝，在這邊可以安安靜靜的品嘗，可惜座位有點少。,"Personal stores, the level of alcohol is very high, very delicious, you can taste quietly here, but unfortunately the seats are a bit less."
"藏在大樓一樓的小店
可以完全認真喝酒的場合
燈光十分微弱
一開始開門進去時還嚇到
有黑暗中品酒的感覺

調酒很厲害

沒有菜單 BARTENDER會問你想要喝怎樣類型的酒
每天會有不同的新鮮水果調酒

就算點 HIGHBALL 也和一般的不一樣
會以比較少見的威士忌調製
不單單只是角瓶

並且會將使用的酒 擺在桌前
讓客人知道使用了那些品項
所以也是可以認識酒的好地方

雖然是日本人開的店
但當天客人大部分是台灣人
因為店小 所以也有些規矩
整間店畢竟只有吧檯座位

所以拒絕三人以上的客人
適合單獨或是雙人去酌飲","The small shop hidden on the first floor of the building
A occasion that can drink completely seriously
The light is very weak
I was scared when I first went in
There is a feeling of wine tasting in darkness

Blooming is very powerful

No menu Bartender will ask you what kind of wine you want to drink
There will be different fresh fruits every day

Even if you order Highball, it is different from ordinary ones
Will be modified with relatively rare whiskey
Not just a horn bottle

And will put the use of wine in front of the table
Let the guests know that those items are used
So it's a good place to know wine

Although it is a shop opened by the Japanese
But most of the guests were Taiwanese that day
Because the store is small, there are some rules
After all, there is only a bar seat after all

So the guests who reject more than three people
Suitable for individual or double people to drink"
"老闆很有趣又很嚴肅
非常神奇的mix體
最好一個人去 專心品嚐孤獨感和調酒
喝到很驚艷的gimlet","The boss is very interesting and serious
Very magical MIX body
It's best to focus on taste loneliness and bartending alone
Drink the amazing gimlet"
隱密的小酒吧，適合安安靜靜地喝一杯，或和一兩位朋友聊聊天。（注意，據說老闆不接3位以上的客人哦！） 如果有來這裡消費也請保持輕聲細語：）,"The hidden bar is suitable for drinking a cup quietly or chatting with one or two friends.(Note, it is said that the boss does not pick up more than 3 guests!) If you come here to consume, please keep a soft voice :)"
老闆調酒技術專業，對待客人有禮，把日本調酒師的職人文化帶來台北,"Boss bartending technology major, treat guests courtesy, bring the culture of Japanese bartenders to Taipei to Taipei"
小谷調和的手法非常的優雅，酒感也很重，安靜昏暗的店內，一個人點個兩杯獨自享受會非常開心。,"Xiaogu's reconciliation technique is very elegant, and the wine feels very heavy. In a quiet and dim shop, you can enjoy two cups alone to enjoy it alone."
環境氣氛好，安安靜靜，適合沈澱自我，酒真的好喝。小谷先生調完後會把酒放在桌上給你看。,"The environment atmosphere is good, quiet, suitable for precipitating self, wine is really delicious.Mr. Kobaya will show you the wine on the table after tuning."
調酒的味道很特別，講話真的不能很大聲，因為很安靜，點酒時，大家都在看你。適合一個人來安靜，不適合呼朋引伴。北極光不會調，不用點。,"The taste of bartending is very special, and the speech really cannot be loud, because it is quiet, everyone is watching you when ordering wine.Suitable for a person to be quiet, not suitable for friends.Northern light will not be adjusted, no need to order."
"無菜單的地方
只要跟老闆說 濃淡 口味 酸甜苦辣
老闆便會調出令你滿意的酒
而且每個動作都很細膩
另外這邊只適合喜歡安靜的地方
如果你很吵 會被其他客人白眼 甚至被老闆請出去","No menu
As long as you say to the boss, the flavor is sweet, sweet, bitter
The boss will call up the wine that makes you satisfied
And every action is very delicate
In addition, here is only suitable for the place where you like quiet
If you are noisy, you will be asked by other guests and even invited by the boss"
有用薑的都很厲害 其他調酒口感也很棒 老闆也很nice,"Those who have ginger are very powerful. Other bartending taste is also great, the boss is very nice"
酒保十分專業，基本功非常扎實，經典調酒都在水準之上。環境簡潔靜寗，適合獨飲或聊天。,"The wine insurance is very professional, the basic skills are very solid, and the classic bartending is above the standard.The environment is simple and quiet, suitable for drinking or chatting alone."
氣氛營造非常好，近乎全黑的環境搭配曖昧的led燭燈燈光，能帶來意想不到的體驗。無酒單由客人提供口味讓酒保調製，用酒跟調製的水準高但是建議要會一點日文，因為他是日本人，雖然聽得懂基本的中文但太難的沒辦法傳達。,"The atmosphere is very good. The nearly black environment with ambiguous LED candlelight lights can bring unexpected experiences.The wine -free list is provided by the guests to make the wine guarantee. The level of wine and modulation is high, but it is recommended to have a little Japanese, because he is a Japanese, although he understands the basic Chinese but it is too difficult to convey."
極度安靜的酒吧，位置有限，能讓人專心的品味當下與調酒，味道還不賴，是個適合一個人來訪的酒吧,"The extremely quiet bar, limited location, can make people focus on the present and bartender, the taste is not bad, it is a bar suitable for visiting alone"
"最新的評論：
最近再訪，還是適合一個人喝酒，四年來我也跑了不少店，但這裏的兩杯量少的酒居然要台幣1100，無法接受，且較創新的風味如茶酒這邊是無法提供的，可能比較適合old school吧。

這家的冰塊是使用外送進來已經切好的方冰，但讓我最不能接受的是我親眼看到調酒師用手拿已切好的方冰放在客人的酒杯裡，差評。

四年前的評論：
適合一個人去喝酒的地方，店內很安靜，調酒師為日本人，不太會說中文。
每個客人進來都說日文，害我以為都是日本人，結果根本台灣人。","The latest comment:
Recently, I still have to drink alone. I have also ran a lot of stores for four years, but the two cups of wine here are NT $ 1100, which cannot be accepted. Yes, it may be more suitable for Old School.

This ice cubes are Fang Bing, who has been cut in with the delivery, but what makes me most unacceptable is that I saw that the bartender used the cut Fang Bing to put it in the guest's glass. Essence

Comments four years ago:
Suitable for one person to drink, the store is very quiet, the bartender is the Japanese, and it is not very good at speaking Chinese.
Every guest comes in and says Japanese, which hurts me that they are all Japanese, and they are fundamentally Taiwanese."
需要安靜的酒吧，老闆會講一點中文，氣氛跟其他酒吧差異很大。,"Need a quiet bar, the boss will speak a little Chinese, and the atmosphere is very different from other bars."
低調內斂的Bar ，需要互相接受規定後享受生活中的黑暗時光與twilight,"Low -key and restrained BAR, you need to enjoy the dark time and Twilight in life after accepting the requirements of each other"
"座席約十人，風格簡約嚴謹日式，燈光昏暗，安靜，可以把注意力集中在酒，也許跟自己同行友人的細語互動。
酒類風格偏重，不丟失這個前提，確保了風味又順口。老闆會有一些特殊的酒，很適合在這個前提下品味這些佳釀帶來的差異。

一個人，
適合想要放鬆，將自己愛好信任交給老闆，客製的客人。
如果對調酒略懂，可以去觀察每一個細節，老闆的風味組成手法，可以得到很多啟發。特別是會自己動手的人，大推觀察。
兩個人的話，對於不那麼確定自己愛好的友人也可以放心把要求交給老闆。
完成品很簡約，同時會把構成的酒類材料放在前方，如果喜歡，趕快筆記，回家複製，如果發現還是不如老闆的手藝，那就是為什麼要上去光顧的又一個理由了。

因為無酒單，所以適合理解自己愛好，或是對調酒有認識的人慢慢享受。當然也能單純的享受老闆的手藝，敞開心胸去享受每一杯精心調製的成品，每一杯都有獨特的風味可以玩味。

單杯的威士忌，只要是加冰，老闆也會適度去融水，延展完整精彩的風味才放到客人手邊，大推。","There are about ten seats, the style is simple and rigorous, the lights are dim, and the lights can be concentrated in wine. Maybe interact with your friends with your friends.
The style of wine is heavy, and the premise does not lose, ensuring the flavor and smoothness.The boss will have some special wines, which is very suitable for the difference between these wines on this premise.

one person,
Suitable for guests who want to relax and give their own hobbies to the boss, customer -made guests.
If you know a little about bartending, you can observe every detail. The boss's flavor composition method can be inspired by a lot of inspiration.Especially people who do it by themselves, push for observation.
For two people, for friends who are not so sure, they can also associate with the request to the boss.
The finished product is very simple, and at the same time, the alcohol materials that constitute the formation are in front. If you like it, take notes, go home and copy. If you find that you are not as good as the boss's craftsmanship, it is another reason why you go to patronize.

Because there is no wine list, it is suitable for understanding your hobbies, or people who know alcohol slowly.Of course, you can simply enjoy the boss's craftsmanship, open your mind to enjoy each cup of carefully prepared finished products, and each cup has a unique flavor to play.

With a single cup of whiskey, as long as it is adding ice, the boss will moderate the water, extend the complete and wonderful flavor, and put it on the hand of the guests."
"高分給了小谷先生精心維護的昏暗低調氣氛，對於習慣酒吧中熱烈又有濃烈費洛蒙競爭的男男女女來說，小谷是個能好好喘口氣的憩處（沒有背景音樂）。直到眼睛適應黑暗後，身旁的人還是只有假燭光映照的輪廓，雖說看不清，但你想藏的情緒也都能藏起來。
酒精濃度偏高，但滋味極好。","The high score gave the dim and low -key atmosphere that Mr. Kobaya was carefully maintained. For men and women who were used to the warm and strong Ferlo Mon competition in the bar, Kobaya was a resting place (no background music).Until the eyes adapt to the darkness, the people next to them still only have the outline of the fake candlelight. Although it is unclear, the emotions you want to hide can be hidden.
The concentration of alcohol is high, but the taste is excellent."
氣氛非常好的小bar，適合幾個朋友聊天，小酌一下。(店家門口有標示不接待四人以上的團體),"Little BAR, who is very good atmosphere, is suitable for a few friends to chat and drink.(There is a group that labels not to receive more than four people at the door of the store)"
日式酒吧，安靜適合一個人，調酒細緻有質感。,"Japanese -style bar, quiet suitable for a person, meticulous and textured."
"目前去過最安靜的bar
特地找適合一人喝酒的
真的很適合一個人靜靜喝酒的地方😌 …","I have been to the quietest BAR currently
Find specifically for one person to drink
It's really suitable for a person where a person is drinking quietly 😌 ..."
"老實說，一開始進去前有點怕怕的，裡面真的很暗啊😂
勇敢的跨進店門後才發現，這裡是個適合與自己相處的療癒處🥰

今天點了兩杯以苦為主題的Whisky調酒😋

小谷先生在調好第一杯時，會細心詢問是否有符合；調整後，第二杯就比較接近喜歡的風格🖤

但我忘了，物極必反，其實兩杯喝起來還是甜的😂","Honestly, it was a bit scared before entering at first, and it was really dark.
After entering the store bravely, I found out that this is a healing place suitable for yourself 🥰

I ordered two cups today with bitky as the theme.

When Mr. Kobaya adjusts the first cup, he will carefully ask if it is in line; after the adjustment, the second cup is closer to the style of favorite 🖤

But I forgot that things must be reversed. In fact, the two cups are still sweet."
道地的日本酒吧，專業的調酒，但化粧室是公共廁所😅$$$😋😋😋 …,"The authentic Japanese bar, professional bartending, but the makeup room is a public toilet 😅 $ 6 😋😋😋 ..."
"這是不能訂位，並且位置極少的店家，能夠進入的訣竅就是早一點到或是你的運氣爆發。

店內非常安靜，也非常暗，在裡面，可以很快的平靜下來，反觀自己。我非常推薦一人前往。","This is the tips that cannot be reached and the shops with very little location.

The store is very quiet and very dark. Inside, you can calm down quickly and look at yourself.I recommend one person to go."
"我很少因為沒有任何贈品評論5星
但是這間店我私心認為是台灣水準最高的酒吧
沒有之一
絕對值得造訪","I rarely have 5 stars because there are no gift comments
But this shop I personally think it is a bar at the highest level in Taiwan
One without one
Absolutely worth visiting"
氣氛很好，調酒很專業，適合一個人來沉澱一下，不能訂位、最多招待兩人的客人,"The atmosphere is very good, the bartending is very professional, it is suitable for one person to settle."
很適合放鬆的地方，不會有太多的喧囂，可以享受一下獨處的時光,"It is very suitable for relaxation, there will be too many hustle and bustle, you can enjoy the time you are alone"
"很特別：

2.只能1個人或2個人來

無光、無音樂&無酒單的酒吧，適合獨飲、知己好友小聲閒聊放鬆的好地方，也適合存粹享受調酒，抽離城市的塵囂與煩雜,"Bar without light, no music & no wine list, suitable for good places for drinking and relaxing and relaxing, also suitable for alcoholic bartending, pulling away from the custody and annoyance of the city"
直接跟老闆說想喝的味道，調出來的口味超過預期的好喝，適合想靜靜品酒放空的人。,"He told the boss directly to the taste of drinking, and the taste of the tuned out exceeds the expected deliciousness, suitable for those who want to quietly tastor wine and empty."
經典方面無懈可擊，香氣跟平衡感都做的很好,"The classic is impeccable, and the aroma and balance are done well"
如果你喜歡安靜，想要下班後靜一靜，非常適合,"If you like to be quiet, you want to be quiet after get off work, it is very suitable"
只有燭光，沒有音樂再加上小谷先生的職人精神，搭配平衡度極佳的經典調酒，非常適合想獨處時自己前往的酒吧！,"Only candlelight, no music, coupled with the spirit of Mr. Komana, with classic bartending with excellent balance, it is very suitable for the bar where you want to go alone!"
1~2個人來，能夠擁有安靜、愜意的喝酒空間,"1 ~ 2 people come, be able to have a quiet and comfortable drinking space"
老闆是日本人，調酒技術非常好，地方小但靜謐很適合兩人聊天,"The boss is a Japanese, and the bartending technology is very good. The place is small but quiet is suitable for two people to chat"
酒都很好喝 經典調酒都超讚,The wine is delicious and the classic bartend
日式無菜單酒吧，職人精神，要保持安靜,"Japanese -style menu -free bar, the spirit of the staff, to keep quiet"
"我發現這裡的酒的冰度很適合人的腸胃
在這裡喝到的酒有一股舒服的甜味
讓我可以好好休息的同時精神又慢慢變好","I found that the ice of the wine here is very suitable for people's stomach
The wine you drink here has a comfortable sweetness
Let me take a good rest and slowly get better at the same time"
極為經典的日式酒吧，店主嚴肅與風趣並存，適合已有長期品酒經驗的人前來，店內沒有音樂燈光極為昏暗，僅適合1~2人前來（人多也不收座位數少），建議以喝酒為主要目的時到訪。,"The very classic Japanese -style bar, the owner coexists seriously and funny, suitable for people with long -term wine tasting experience. There is no music light in the store very dim, only suitable for 1 to 2 people (there are few people who do not receive seats). Visit with drinking as the main purpose."
"有自信是好事
反正台灣人也哈日

如果你很哈日本人，覺得日本人很酷，這家店適合你，
如果你是正常想喝酒開心的，台北一堆比這好的酒吧，真的沒必要到一個伸手不見五指還不能聊天講話的店","Being confidence is a good thing
Anyway, Taiwanese

If you are very Japanese, I think the Japanese are cool, this shop is suitable for you,
If you want to drink and be happy normally, a bunch of bunch of bars in Taipei really does not need to go to a shop where you can’t chat with five fingers and you can't chat and speak."
十足的日式調酒風格，細膩、講究細節，環境安靜而沈穩，很適合聊心事的地方。,"The full Japanese -style bartending style, delicate, particular about the details, quiet and calm environment, which is very suitable for talking about things."

"氣氛很好 不吵雜  老闆總能調出讓人驚艷的酒
很有深度的人與酒","The atmosphere is very good.
Very deep people and wine"
第一次體驗愛上了，謝謝小谷先生的細心與貼心,"I fell in love for the first time, thank you for your carefulness and thoughtfulness of Mr. Komana"
就像無菜單高級日本料庭，沒有menu（自然也沒有價目表），小小幽暗的空間，沒有自己的洗手間（附近有大樓稍簡陋的公廁），來自日本神奈川的型男調酒師，中文略通，調酒過程像是一個儀式，調好酒後主要使用的基酒會擺在你面前讓你“品鑒”。沒賣紅酒、白酒、清酒，除了雞尾酒外好像有賣啤酒，可能也有whisky，抵消每人500，基本一杯酒350起跳。酒杯裡的大冰塊是方形的，這點我挺喜歡，但調酒不能說很驚艷，但我也不是專家。生意還不錯，裡面非常安靜，門口寫不招待四人以上團體。總體來說三星，但因為特殊的氛圍，有在村上春樹小說裡的情境感，因為所在的破舊大樓，也有香港、老上海或者科幻電影裡場景的奇妙體驗，為這再加一星，推薦可以嘗試看看。,"Just like there is no menu high -end Japanese material, there is no Menu (naturally there is no price list), a small and dark space, no toilet (there is a slightly simple public toilet nearby), a male winemaker from Kanagawa, Japan, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese, Chinese Slightly, the process of bartender is like a ritual. The main wine used after adjusting the wine will be placed in front of you to ""taste"".No red wine, liquor, and sake. In addition to cocktails, there seems to be a beer. There may also be whisky, which offsets 500 per person. Basically, a glass of wine is 350.The big ice cubes in the wine glass are square. I like this, but I ca n’t say that bartending can not be said to be amazing, but I am not an expert.The business is not bad, and it is very quiet inside. The group does not entertain more than four people at the door.Generally speaking, Samsung, but because of a special atmosphere, there is a sense of context in Haruki Novels in Murakami, because the shabby building where it is located also has a wonderful experience in the scenes of Hong Kong, old Shanghai or science fiction movies. You can try it."
當我第一次遇到情傷時有人推薦了我這個地方，我真的很感謝我朋友介紹了一個能讓人感到放鬆、安靜、舒服的地方.,"When I first encountered love, someone recommended me. I really thanked my friends for introducing a place that makes people feel relaxed, quiet, and comfortable."
整體氣氛幽靜，適合靜靜喝酒的好地方。老闆對氣氛掌握很有主見，滑手機的客人有太大的影片聲會被制止，但2-3人小聲聊天就不特別在意。下次還想再去,"The overall atmosphere is quiet, suitable for a good place to drink quietly.The boss is very opinionated about the atmosphere. The guests who slide the mobile phone too much will be stopped, but 2-3 people will not pay special attention to chatting.I want to go again next time"
心靈的場所，可以好好的品嚐一杯酒。,The place of the soul can taste a glass of wine.
老闆規定很多，店裡的小燈一直閃讓眼睛不舒服，不能把小燈移走或關掉；整個空間讓人不自在也不放鬆。調酒的部分口味還可以，三杯調酒加一杯礦泉水花了1300，個人覺得不值得,"The boss stipulates that there are many, the small lights in the shop have been flashed to make the eyes uncomfortable, and the small light cannot be removed or turned off; the entire space makes people uncomfortable and not relaxed.Part of the taste of bartending is okay. Three cups of bartending plus a cup of mineral water spend 1300, personally I think it is not worth it"
空間不大、非常的暗，很適合安靜的喝杯酒,"The space is not large and very dark, it is very suitable for drinking a glass of wine quietly"
其實我不想給高分讓大家一起來搶位子但小谷好棒唷～,"Actually, I don’t want to give everyone a high score to grab the seat together, but Komatsu is great ~"
"接近滿分的環境，
安靜、乾靜，就是高端，酒品平價又好喝","Near the full score environment,
Quiet, dry, is high -end, wine is cheap and delicious"
"很特別的一家小酒館。能招待的顧客有限，不過是就算一個人也能盡情喝酒的地方，價錢上也是能接受的。
喝酒時還能研究老闆放在你面前的酒瓶來知道調配的可能方法，如果帶女伴去也是一個很好的話題（笑","A special tavern.Customers who can entertain are limited, but even if a person can drink alcohol, the price is acceptable.
When drinking, you can also study the bottle in front of you to know the possible method of allocation. If you take a female companion, it is also a good topic (laugh"
很安靜、連音樂都沒有的酒吧，很適合跟一兩個朋友聊天或是自己小酌。小谷先生的各項經典調酒都很專業，就算不太懂酒也沒關係，小谷先生會很有耐心的為你推薦及講解,"It is very quiet and not even music, which is very suitable for chatting with one or two friends or drinking by yourself.Mr. Komana's classic bartending is very professional, even if you don't know much about wine, it doesn't matter. Mr. Kobaya will be patiently recommended and explained for you."
隱密的地點，日式的木矮拉門，進去是黑色的牆面，昏暗燈光安靜的氛圍，有一些獨自前來的日本人在此品酒獨飲並與老闆聊天，這裡很適合想要安靜品飲的人士。低消500一人（啤酒一瓶500）,"The hidden location, the Japanese -style wooden sloping door, the black wall in the go in, the dim light and quiet atmosphere, some Japanese people who came alone to drink and chat with the boss here. People with quiet drinks.500 people low (a bottle of 500 beer)"
可以體驗日本酒館的感覺，自己一個人很適合來，安靜的沈思喝酒，這裡沒有酒單，憑著當下的心情點所想要風味的酒，甜苦辣隨心點，或者想喝beer，品嚐喜愛的酒悠閒渡過夜晚。,"You can experience the feeling of the Japanese tavern. You are very suitable for yourself. He is meditating and drinking quietly. There is no wine list here. With the flavor of the flavor you want at the moment, you are sweet and bitter. The wine crossed the night leisurely."
氛圍很特別，是可以好好品酒的地方，但經典調酒的酒氣/口味非常濃厚，可能要重型醉漢才能接受了,"The atmosphere is very special. It is a place that can be tasting well, but the classic alcoholic alcohol/taste is very strong. It may be necessary to accept it."
適合一個人的安靜酒吧。視力不好的人要注意，因為會被小谷先生說手機不能太亮。,"Suitable for a quiet bar.People with poor vision should pay attention, because Mr. Kobayashi will say that the mobile phone should not be too bright."
"激推，安靜舒服放鬆以外
小谷的調酒技術，是重點中的重點
無菜單，你如何跟他要求
小谷都能特制一杯：你要求條件下，又極好喝的酒
發揮的淋漓盡致，真的好喝！專業！","Push, be quiet and comfortable to relax
Komatsu's bartending technology is the focus of the focus
No menu, how do you ask him
Kobaya can make a special cup: You have a good wine under the requirements of your requirements
The full performance is really delicious!major!"
越簡單的調酒，越看得到職人的精神,"The simpler the bartending, the more you can see the spirit of the staff"
"低消500沒有菜單
但只要告訴小谷先生你想要の他會帶給你驚喜👍🏻👍🏻
座位只有10個，裡面沒有音樂🎵很適合小酌與好友談心。 …","There is no menu at low 500
But as long as you tell Mr. Komana, you want の to bring you surprise 👍🏻👍🏻
There are only 10 seats, there is no music, it is suitable for drinking with friends.Mowing"
精準的服務與雞尾酒。第一次去對於沒有音樂及黑暗的環境可能會感到小有壓力，但離開時，絕對會想再次造訪!,"Accurate services and cocktails.For the first time, I may feel small pressure on the environment without music and darkness, but when I leave, I will definitely want to visit again!"
調酒師很專業，會幫客人客製化，想喝什麼都可以~喝起來適中剛剛好，我一個女孩子都非常喜歡，,"The bartender is very professional, it will help guests customize, you can drink anything ~ It is just right to drink. I like a girl very much. I like it very much."
氣氛很...凝重，不太適合high咖,"The atmosphere is very ... dignified, not suitable for High coffee"
非常有特色及安靜的地方，彷彿身境日本的酒吧，想一個人靜一靜或跟朋友聊天都很適合，調酒很棒也很專業。,"Very distinctive and quiet places, like a Japanese bar in Japan. It is very suitable for people to be quiet or chatting with friends. The bartending is great and professional."
"非常講究的日式酒吧,適合一個人去或是與朋友輕談心事. 時隔兩年再訪一樣令人喜愛的地方.",The very particular Japanese bar is suitable for one person or talks with friends. It is just like a favorite place after two years.
燈光美氣氛佳，調酒又好喝，很適合一個人來小酌,"The lights are beautiful, and the bartending is delicious. It is very suitable for a person to drink"
氛圍與選酒都非常獨到，調得好極了,"The atmosphere and the selection of wine are very unique, and the adjustment is extremely good"
"氣氛佳 安靜 無酒单
只要說出想要酸甜苦辣哪種味道就可以調出滿意的調酒
口袋名單+1","The atmosphere is good and quiet without wine
As long as you say you want sweet and sour bitterness, you can mix out satisfactory bartending
List of Pocket +1"
終於前來朝聖！調酒和氛圍都很棒的一間小店，非常安靜非常暗😂想找地方靜靜喝一杯的好選擇 …,"Finally come to the pilgrimage!A small shop with a great bartending and atmosphere, very quiet and dark 😂 I want to find a place to drink a cup quietly ..."
"調酒很讚，老闆很專業，中文英文日文都能通哦
適合安靜喝，跟老闆聊聊天","The bartending is very good, the boss is very professional, Chinese English can be opened in Chinese and Japanese
Suitable for quiet drinking, chat with the boss"
空間小，但安靜舒適，空調也非常剛好，老闆會讓你先聞一下基酒的味道喜不喜歡再調非常棒。,"The space is small, but quiet and comfortable, and the air conditioner is also very good. The boss will let you smell the taste of the base wine first."
"絕對是我最愛的一家店
也是我藏在心中
絕不隨便帶不懂酒 不懂寧靜的人
前往的一間店
這是台北bar hooper的聖殿","Definitely my favorite shop
I also hidden in my heart
Never bring people who do not understand wine casually
A shop where you go
This is the temple of Taipei Bar Hooper"
我人生這輩子去過最安靜的Bar。質感很好 調酒很好 音量很小,"I have been to the quietest BAR in my life.The texture is very good and the bartender is very good, the volume is very small"
適合一個人安靜思考人生或是專心品嚐酒的地方，遇到很吵的客人會很抓狂,Suitable for a person to think quietly in life or concentrate on tasting wine. It will be crazy when encountering very noisy guests.
細心調酒，貼心的服務，酒的亮點足以照亮整個店面！推個不容錯過的sidecar!,"Careful bartending, intimate service, the highlight of wine is enough to illuminate the entire store!Push a Sidecar that you can't miss!"
非常安靜、幽暗，真正專注在調酒本身，適合自己一個人來,"Very quiet and dark, really focusing on the bartender itself, suitable for yourself"
調酒以經典為主的酒吧，品質還不錯，很適合寧靜躲藏。,"The bartending bar is mainly classic, the quality is not bad, it is very suitable for hiding quietly."
"只有自己與酒，沒有聲音，沒有燈光。
仔細聽就會聽到酒在跟你說故事。","Only yourself and wine, no sound, no light.

"真的很有趣的酒吧。沒有音樂，燈光非常昏暗，座位有限（總共可能有 6-10 人）。

感覺很日本——很多人獨自去喝一杯，幾乎完全沉默地坐著。

調酒師知識淵博。沒有菜單，但我們描述了我們想要的口味，他做了 4 種很棒的飲料。

這是一家雞尾酒吧。他們不提供任何酒。","Really interesting bar.Without music, the lights are very dim and have limited seats (there may be 6-10 people in total).

It feels very Japanese -many people go to drink a drink alone, sitting almost completely silently.

The knowledge of the bartender is profound.There is no menu, but we describe the taste we want, and he made 4 great drinks.

This is a cocktail bar.They do not provide any wine."
"雞尾酒非常美味且令人難忘。毫無疑問，這是我一段時間以來去過的最好的酒吧。

強烈建議您前來參觀，您將品嚐到獨特的獨特而難忘的雞尾酒。

請注意，這是一家非常重視飲酒體驗的酒吧，如果您想要舉辦狂歡或派對，這裡就不是您想要的！

謝謝卡祖桑","Cocktails are delicious and unforgettable.There is no doubt that this is the best bar I have been there for a while.

It is strongly recommended that you come to visit, and you will taste unique and unforgettable cocktails.

Please note that this is a bar that attaches great importance to drinking. If you want to hold a carnival or party, it is not what you want here!

Thank you Kazan"
"位於台北市中心的非常特別的酒吧，不容錯過。沒有菜單，沒有音樂，沒有大聲的談話，（週五）幾乎沒有燈光。雖然只有 11 個座位，所以很可能在早些時候就已經滿了。不幸的是，由於焦點問題，聚會人數上限為 2 人，但由於這是一個放鬆的地方，所以也沒有太大關係。調酒師是日本人，但只能用普通話和英語進行有限的對話。我已經嘗試過了。總共有 9 個人看過飲料，而且還沒有不喜歡任何一種。只要告訴他你想要什麼口味，他就會當場做出來。
我向所有喜歡在黑暗的空間裡喝一杯放鬆的人推薦這種體驗。","A very special bar located in the center of Taipei, not to be missed.No menu, no music, no loud conversation, (Friday) almost no lights.Although there are only 11 seats, it is likely to be full earlier.Unfortunately, due to focusing, the upper limit of the number of parties is two, but because this is a relaxed place, it does not have much relationship.The bartender is Japanese, but only a limited dialogue with Mandarin and English.I have tried it.A total of 9 people have seen drinks, and I don't like any kind.As long as he tells him what taste you want, he will make it on the spot.
I recommend this experience to everyone who likes to drink a cup of relaxation in a dark space."
Bar otani 適合安靜的人獨自喝酒，理清思緒，同時享受台北最好的雞尾酒。調酒師（也是老闆）非常專業。 😍 …,"Bar Otani is suitable for quiet people to drink alone, clarify their thoughts, and enjoy the best cocktails in Taipei at the same time.The bartender (also the boss) is very professional.😍 😍 ..."
我去過台北最酷的酒吧。它位於一棟大樓下的小巷裡，不顯眼。在進入之前，請仔細閱讀規則，以免成為那些吵鬧、令人討厭的顧客之一，肯定會引起惱怒的目光。一旦你低下頭，打開拉門，你就會進入一個燈光昏暗的酒吧，大約有 10 個座位。沒有菜單。簡而言之，讓調酒師知道您通常喜歡或渴望什麼類型的酒。例如，我要了一杯以威士忌為基礎的飲料，並且特別想要一些不含大量糖且相對較烈的飲料。下一杯飲料時，我想要一些茶味的東西，他為我做了一杯杜松子酒。兩者都很棒，每喝一杯，調酒師都會將用於調製飲料的瓶子帶到您面前，供您檢查和享用。我不願意寫這篇評論，因為這絕對是一顆隱藏的寶石，但它太好了，無法不分享。請負責任地享受！,"I have been the coolest bar in Taipei.It is located in an alley under a building, which is not conspicuous.Before entering, please read the rules carefully to avoid becoming one of the noise and annoying customers, and it will definitely cause anger.Once you lower your head and open the sliding door, you will enter a dim light, with about 10 seats.No menu.In short, let the bartender know what type of wine you usually like or long.For example, I want a drink based on whiskey, and I especially want some drinks that do not contain a large amount of sugar and relatively strong.In the next drink, I want some tea -flavored things. He made a glass of Du Songzi wine for me.The two are great. Every time you drink a cup, the bartender will bring the bottle used to prepare the drink to you to check and enjoy it.I don't want to write this comment, because this is definitely a hidden gem, but it is so good that it cannot be shared.Please enjoy it responsible!"
烈酒是標準品牌。位置和風格都非常好。日本調酒師的能力低於國際標準。至少他已經訂婚了。他的技能不允許他的行為和酒吧規則。應該回去接受專業調酒師培訓以找到合適的口味。,Broken wine is a standard brand.The location and style are very good.The ability of Japanese bartender is lower than international standards.At least he has been engaged.His skills do not allow his behavior and bar rules.You should go back to receive professional bartender training to find the right taste.
隱藏在舊公寓裡，步行到酒吧就能感受到安靜的氛圍，與其他的不一樣！ Kazuo san 完全專注於他的調酒！在這裡，你唯一能做的就是靜下心來，享受美酒！值得再去一次,"Hidden in the old apartment, walking into the bar can feel the quiet atmosphere, different from others!Kazuo San is completely focused on his bartender!Here, the only thing you can do is calm down and enjoy wine!It's worth going again"
"好店！
有美味飲品的餐廳(^_-)
天津街附近一家感覺像是藏身處的店！
沒有音樂…沒有燈光…沒有菜單，但您可以享受輕鬆的時光。只要告訴他們你當天的感受以及你想喝的酒類型，師傅就會根據你的心情調製酒。
這是一家只有櫃檯的小店，所以即使你一個人喝酒也可以使用！
(^_-)(^_-)(^_-)(^_-)","Good shop!
Restaurant with delicious drinks (^_-)
A shop near Tianjin Street feels like a store hiding!
No music ... no light ... without menu, but you can enjoy relaxed time.As long as you tell them your feelings and the wines you want to drink, the master will prepare wine based on your mood.
This is a small shop with only counters, so you can use it even if you drink alone!
(^_-) (^_-) (^_-) (^_-)"
隱藏在老公寓裡，走進去就能感受到安靜的氛圍，與其他的不一樣！在這裡，你唯一能做的就是冷靜下來，享受美酒！如果您無法應對並且害怕小黑暗的地方，那麼這裡不適合您。,"Hidden in the apartment, you can feel the quiet atmosphere when walking in, different from others!Here, the only thing you can do is calm down and enjoy wine!If you can't deal with and are afraid of small darkness, then it is not suitable for you."
只有精彩才能表達我對酒吧大谷的喜愛。請遵守保持微妙氛圍的規則，一起享用令人驚嘆的雞尾酒。,Only by wonderful can I express my love for Bar Oshigu.Please follow the rules of maintaining a delicate atmosphere and enjoy the amazing cocktail together.
也許是我去過世界上最好的酒吧之一。就像在夢中一樣。無論您的喜好如何，一位調酒師都會照顧您。美麗的雞尾酒。強烈推薦。早點去，自己佔地方。,"Maybe I have been to the best bar in the world.Just like in a dream.No matter what you like, a bartender will take care of you.Beautiful cocktail.Strongly recommended.Go early and take up your own place."
台北一家隱藏的酒吧，沒有背景音樂，燈光也很少。不一樣的空間只有這裡。,"A hidden bar in Taipei has no background music, and there are very few lights.The different space is only here."
雞尾酒很棒，我肯定會再光臨。,"The cocktail is great, and I will definitely come again."
探索大谷 (Otani)，這是一家舒適的日式酒吧的隱藏瑰寶，專注於預約服務。黑色的牆壁和沒有背景音樂營造出一種讓飲料佔據中心舞台的氛圍。這些飲料均根據您的個人口味和心情精心調製，使大谷成為日本調酒藝術的真正聖地。無論您是單獨遊客還是只是尋求寧靜的體驗，這個地方都能為您提供特別的體驗。在我的網站上了解有關 Bars & Booze 的更多信息，請參閱個人資料中的連結。,"Exploring OTANI, this is a hidden treasure of a comfortable Japanese -style bar, focusing on the appointment service.Black walls and no background music create an atmosphere of drinking beverage to occupy the center stage.These drinks are carefully prepared according to your personal taste and mood, making Oku the real holy place for Japanese bartending art.Whether you are alone or just seeking a tranquility experience, this place can provide you with a special experience.For more information about Bars & Booze on my website, please refer to the connection in your profile."
"這是一家非常原始的商店。我是一個人去的，所以謝謝你讓我和你談論各種事情。
兩種雞尾酒都很美味，所以我會再回來！ （我不知道要不要拍照，因為天黑，氣氛不好，所以沒有照片。）","This is a very primitive store.I went alone, so thank you for let me talk to you about various things.
Both cocktails are delicious, so I will come back again!(I don't know if you want to take a picture, because it is dark, the atmosphere is not good, so there is no photo.)"
喜歡這個安靜的空間，在這裡你知道你會得到一杯美味的雞尾酒，而不必在其他人的聲音和音樂中互相大喊大叫。也非常適合單獨約會之夜。如果我們住在台北，我們就會一直在這裡。也感謝您對酒吧和咖啡的推薦！,"Like this quiet space, here you know you will get a delicious cocktail without having to yell in each other's voice and music.It is also very suitable for a single dating night.If we live in Taipei, we will always be here.Thank you for your recommendation for bar and coffee!"
一個人喝酒最好的地方~~如果你想知道自己喝了多少，哈哈。如果你孤獨就不要走,"The best place to drink alone ~~ If you want to know how much you drink, haha.If you are lonely, don't leave"
"很安靜。適合單身女性。無壓力。簡單的。
需使用公共廁所。","Very quiet.Suitable for single women.No pressure.Simple.
Public toilets need to be used."
我給這家日本酒吧十分之十的評價是出色的雞尾酒和寧靜的環境。,The 10 tenth evaluations of this Japanese bar are excellent cocktails and tranquil environments.
非常特別的地方，沒有任何音樂。適合兩三個人的好地方。這些飲料鼓舞人心且新鮮。,"Very special place, there is no music.Suitable for two or three people.These drinks inspire people's hearts and fresh."
非常私密的酒吧，燈光昏暗，沒有音樂。週四晚上，只有我和調酒師——我們聊得很開心，我也喝了幾杯美味的飲料。,"Very private bar, the lights are dim and have no music.On Thursday night, only I and I talked with the bartender, and I had a few cups of delicious drinks."
在黑暗簡約的環境中精心調製的訂製雞尾酒。沒有菜單——只要告訴 Kazu 你想要什麼，他就會幫你實現。橘子、龍舌蘭酒和苦酒？沒問題——它與少許抹茶利口酒完美地結合在一起。有更甜的東西嗎？杜松子酒和巧克力！有趣的是，這也有效。您也可以訂購所有經典。是台北旅遊的好去處。,"Customized cocktails carefully prepared in the dark and simple environment.No menu -as long as you tell Kazu what you want, he will help you realize.Orange, agave and bitter wine?No problem -it is perfectly combined with a little matcha lip wine.Is there anything sweeter?Du Songzi wine and chocolate!Interestingly, this is also effective.You can also order all classics.It is a good place for Taipei to travel."
"這個地方是一顆寶石。我從未見過如此精心和自豪地釀造的酒。

如果你有一群朋友並且吵鬧的話，這不是一個可以去的地方。

絕對是您晚上喝飲料之前要去的地方。

它是黑暗的、獨特的。只有十個座位。

只要告訴他你喜歡喝什麼類型的酒，剩下的就交給他了。 👍😃","This place is a gem.I have never seen such a well -brewed wine.

If you have a group of friends and noisy, this is not a place to go.

Definitely a place you have to go before drinking drinks at night.

It is dark and unique.There are only ten seats.

Just tell him what type of wine you like to drink, and the rest will be left to him.Bleak"
"這裡的氛圍非常適合隱密的酒吧，雖然它是一家成熟的酒吧，但價格很平均。
即使是大師的手藝、雞尾酒以及每杯飲品的和諧，都讓我有一種在日本標準酒吧受過訓練的感覺。
使用的許多利口酒都是稀有的，大師的選擇也非常出色，簡單的雞尾酒卻有著美味又獨特的口感。
說實話，我很慶幸台灣有這家店，也很慶幸它營業到凌晨2點30分。","The atmosphere here is very suitable for hidden bars. Although it is a mature bar, the price is very average.
Even the master's craftsmanship, cocktails, and the harmony of each drink make me feel a feeling of being trained in the standard bar in Japan.
Many of the liquid wines used are rare, and the choice of the master is also very good. The simple cocktail has a delicious and unique taste.
To be honest, I am very fortunate to have this store in Taiwan, and I am very fortunate that it will open until 2:30 in the morning."
我以前從未覺得有必要寫評級，但這裡的調酒師絕對是一位魔術師。我一生中從未嚐過如此美味的雞尾酒。強烈推薦。相信調酒師，給他最少的指導，他就會為你調製出令人驚嘆的東西。,"I never thought it was necessary to write rating, but the bartender here was definitely a magician.I have never tasted such a delicious cocktail in my life.Strongly recommended.Believe that the bartender, give him the least guidance, will make a amazing thing for you."
一定會回到台北只是為了這裡的雞尾酒！  👍🏼 …,I will definitely return to Taipei just for the cocktails here!👍🏼 👍🏼 ...
"黑暗中，燈光最少！氣氛很好。
飲料很美味。
店主也很好！現在想來，我和專業人士進行了一次可恥的談話，但我非常感謝你。","In the dark, the light is the least!The atmosphere is very good.
Drinks are delicious.
The owner is also very good!Now I want to come, I have a shameful conversation with the professionals, but I am very grateful to you."
這個地區最好的酒吧。請注意，這不是一個吵鬧的地方。主人很仁慈，不會強行帶走，但起碼的禮貌還是要遵守的。小聲地提出各種要求（笑），然後讓他們為您提供適合您的杯子。你會度過一段美好的時光。,"The best bar in this area.Please note that this is not a noisy place.The owner is kind and will not take away forcibly, but at least the politeness still must be observed.Make a whispering request (laughs), and then let them provide you with a cup suitable for you.You will spend a good time."
"我希望店主不要假設每個新顧客都透過心靈感應進行交流，並且知道您的商店運營的系統。如果你在門上貼一個牌子，上面寫著“容量已滿”，這對每個人都會更有幫助，這是一種燈箱，在吧台處有一個觸摸按鈕開關，可以由工作人員在監控裡面的情況時進行控制。

當我打開門時，裡面一片漆黑，氣氛絕對不友善。過了一會兒才適應，這時我注意到調酒師默默地向我揮手。我以為這是一種問候。我向前踏了一步，突然意識到這實際上是一種「再見」的揮手。感覺自己像個不受歡迎的入侵者，突然破壞了他精心打造的安靜空間。非常失望，因為一個朋友強烈推薦它，而且我走了很長的路才找到它。","I hope that the owner will not assume that every new customer communicates through the mind and knows the system of your store operation.If you post a sign on the door, which says ""the capacity is full"", this will be more helpful for everyone. This is a light box. There is a touch button switch at the bar. Control in the case.

When I opened the door, the inside was dark, and the atmosphere was absolutely not friendly.After a while before adapting, I noticed that the bartender silently waved to me silently.I thought this was a greeting.I took a step forward and suddenly realized that this was actually a ""goodbye"" wave.It feels like an unpopular invader, suddenly destroying the quiet space he created.Very disappointed because a friend highly recommended it, and I found it for a long time."
完全關注雞尾酒。沒有音樂、燈光和大聲轉換的干擾。如果您無法應對並且害怕小黑暗的地方，那麼這裡不適合您。如果您真的喜歡不尋常且挑戰口味的雞尾酒，那麼您就來了。,"Focus on cocktails.There is no interference of music, lighting and loud conversion.If you can't deal with and are afraid of small darkness, then it is not suitable for you.If you really like unusual and challenged cocktails, then you are here."
光是氣氛就值得了，飲料也很好——沒有菜單。雖然並不是所有的雞尾酒都像我期望的那樣，但我仍然會再次去安靜地聊天。,"The atmosphere alone is worth it, and the drink is very good -no menu.Although not all cocktails are as expected, I will still chat quietly again."
在這裡，你會全神貫注地品嚐每杯酒。店內的氣氛還有bartender 的調酒技巧讓你不得不把所有註意力集中在你吞下的每一口，然後回味無窮。,"Here, you will fully taste each glass of wine.The atmosphere in the store also has Bartender's bartending skills that allow you to focus all your attention to every bite you swallowed, and then the aftertaste is endless."
這是一個安靜喝一杯的好地方。店主是日本調酒師，很注重自己的手藝。風格是日式的，簡約、精緻、安靜。沒有音樂，沒有藝術，只有酒精和桌子。  最低 500 台幣,"This is a good place to drink a cup quietly.The owner is a Japanese bartender, paying attention to his own craftsmanship.The style is Japanese, simple, delicate, and quiet.There are no music, no art, only alcohol and tables.Minimum 500 Taiwan dollars"
"你必須了解如何尊重飲酒然後你
在這裡享受。","You must understand how to respect drinking and then you
Enjoy here."
"我在東京的某個地方
看起來像酒吧
有些人喜歡這樣
注意事項是成人禮儀
一杯令人愉快的雞尾酒
我得到了它","My place in Tokyo
Looks like a bar
Some people like this
Note is adult etiquette
A pleasant cocktail
I got it"
城裡最頂尖的調酒師之一，說話也很溫柔，所以他就在自己周圍建造了一家酒吧。沒有音樂，沒有裝飾，只專注於精準調製的優質飲品。,"One of the top bartender in the city, he was very gentle, so he built a bar around him.There are no music, no decoration, and only focus on high -quality drinks."
"這是一個獨自喝酒的好地方。店主非常溫柔又友善。如果有人想喝一杯美味的雞尾酒，我會推薦來這裡參觀。

我已經期待著再次去那裡了。","This is a good place to drink alone.The owner is very gentle and friendly.If someone wants to drink a delicious cocktail, I will recommend visiting here.

I have been looking forward to going there again."
"這個地方是光輝的統治者。

你可以訂購任何你喜歡的東西：一種感覺、情緒、給他看一張照片、告訴他一種顏色，任何你能想到的東西他絕對會以液體形式釘下來。
我要了一杯“該死的好咖啡”，他卻把它喝掉了。
那天是他 30 歲生日，所以我們要了一個生日蛋糕，他做了液體形式的。
我的朋友要求參加一場綜合格鬥比賽，他調製了一杯飲料，讓你感覺自己正被一塊滿頭大汗的紋身牛肉餅壓著。
街頭幫派？不是問題！不久之後，我們就被詹姆斯·迪恩圍住了，而方齊則跳過了我們倆以及我們飲料中的鯊魚。

參觀了這個地方後，我意識到其他所有酒吧都沒有嘗試過，需要回去睡覺。

iirc 團體最多可容納 4 人，總共只有大約 12-15 個座位。
最好的方法是預訂或在開放時間到達，因為它很快就滿了，而且你不知道人們會待多久。

最低訂購金額約為新台幣 500 美元，飲料每份約為 300 美元，如果您來自澳大利亞珀斯，這個價格並不算貴，在那裡您可以以這個價格買到 1/2 瓶用過的水。

也不要吝嗇，給他小費！","This place is a glorious rulers.

You can order anything you like: a feeling, emotion, showing him a photo, and telling him a color. What you can think of will be nailed down in the form of liquid.
I asked for a ""damn good coffee"", but he drank it.
It was his 30th birthday that day, so we asked for a birthday cake, and he made a liquid form.
My friend asked to participate in a comprehensive fighting competition. He made a cup of drink, making you feel that he was pressed by a sweat tattoo beef cake.
Street gang?Not a problem!Soon after, we were surrounded by James Dien, while Fang Qi skipped the sharks in the two of us and our drinks.

After visiting this place, I realized that all other bars had never tried and needed to go back to sleep.

IIRC groups can accommodate up to 4 people, with only about 12-15 seats in total.
The best way is to book or arrive at the opening time, because it is full soon, and you don't know how long it will stay.

The minimum order amount is about $ 500, and the drink is about $ 300 per copy. If you come from Perth, Australia, the price is not expensive, where you can buy 1/2 bottles of water at this price.

Don't be stingy, give him a tip!"
適合每個人的很棒的酒吧。當然，主人會說英語、中文和日語。如果您對威士忌或雞尾酒一無所知，請不要害怕。快來享受一次美好的體驗吧！,"A great bar suitable for everyone.Of course, the owner will speak English, Chinese and Japanese.If you know nothing about whiskey or cocktail, don't be afraid.Come and enjoy a good experience!"
很棒的地下酒吧，調酒師很友善。 10/10還會再去！,"A great underground bar, the bartender is very friendly.10/10 will go again!"
美味的雞尾酒以及安靜輕鬆的氛圍。  強烈推薦它。,The delicious cocktail and a quiet and relaxed atmosphere.Recommend it strongly.
我們至少去過這個地方 5 次，每次日本老闆 Kazuo 的風格都讓我們感到驚訝。一次關於雞尾酒和寧靜的未知體驗。謝謝一夫,"We have been to at least 5 times in this place, and the style of Japanese boss Kazuo is surprised at each time.An unknown experience about cocktails and tranquility.Thank you"
有趣的藏身處，飲料還可以（我喝了一杯杜松子酒馬提尼，太甜了，而且很一般），適合安靜的聚會，不適合大團體。無需預約。,"Interesting hiding, drinks are okay (I drank a cup of Dutongzi wine Maridini, which is too sweet, and very general), suitable for quiet gatherings, not suitable for large groups.No appointment is required."
日本調酒師提供的創意雞尾酒。我們進行了兩次實驗，一次是琴酒，另一次是蘭姆酒。這是令人滿意和鼓舞人心的。,"Creative cocktail provided by Japanese bartender.We conducted two experiments, one was piano wine, and the other was Rim.This is satisfactory and inspiring."
"我第一次來的時候，顧客很多，但令我驚訝的是店主的粗魯。即使日本經理人在台灣很受歡迎，
對顧客態度這麼差可以嗎？","When I came for the first time, there were many customers, but what surprised me was the rudeness of the owner.Even if the Japanese manager is very popular in Taiwan,
Is it so bad for the customer's attitude?"
整體來說很酷的酒吧，但不幸的是我覺得我喝的飲料就一般般了。每人最低消費為新台幣800元，即每人2杯飲品。,"Overall the cool bar, but unfortunately, I think the drink I drink is average.The minimum consumption per person is NT $ 800, that is, 2 cups of drinks per person."
如果您正在尋找正宗的東西，這是台北最好的餐廳之一。沒有那麼花哨，但只是最好的飲料。,"If you are looking for authentic things, this is one of the best restaurants in Taipei.Not so fancy, but just the best drink."
一個安靜祥和的酒吧，提供美味的雞尾酒！,A quiet and peaceful bar offers delicious cocktails!
沒有音樂，所以只有你和你的思緒，沉思著為你提供的飲料，偶爾會被安靜的談話或調製另一種雞尾酒的輕柔叮噹聲打斷。,"There is no music, so only your thoughts and you, contemplating the drinks provided for you, occasionally interrupted by quiet conversations or modulation of another cocktail."
"隱密的酒吧♪
很好吃！
推薦單獨飲用！
如果多人的話，可能無法進入。","Hidden bar 吧
Very delicious!
It is recommended to drink alone!
If there are many people, it may not be able to enter."
這是日本還是台北？一個讓你流連忘返的酒吧。沒有音樂，沒有鄰居的噪音。讓您感到輕鬆。,"Is this Japan or Taipei?A bar that makes you linger.No music, no neighbors' noise.Make you feel relaxed."
"如果您想品嚐正宗的雞尾酒和台灣獨有的創意陣容，那就來這裡吧！
主人會帶著慈祥的笑容歡迎您的光臨！ ！","If you want to taste authentic cocktails and unique creative lineups in Taiwan, come here!
The owner will welcome you with a kind smile!Intersection"
"一個隱蔽的酒吧
沒有菜單，飲料是根據顧客的喜好提供的。","A hidden bar
No menu, drinks are provided according to the preferences of customers."
一個真正的藏身處。我希望我早點找到它。樓主的人品也很完美。如果下次有機會去台灣，我一定會去的。,"A real hiding place.I hope I will find it early.The character's character is also perfect.If I have the opportunity to go to Taiwan next time, I will definitely go."
有史以來最好的調酒師。不要照自己的要求去做，讓他給你做點什麼，並給予一兩個指導方針。晚點再謝我！,"There is the best bartender ever.Don't do it according to his requirements, let him do something, and give one or two guidelines.Thank you later!"
這裡幾乎是漆黑一片，一片寂靜，所以我說話時盡量小心！我覺得一個人的話還好，但是如果有人在一起的話，可能會很難說話！,"This is almost dark and silent, so be careful when I speak!I think it's okay for a person's words, but if someone is together, it may be difficult to speak!"
燈光比之前更暗了，真是個藏身之所啊！,"The lights are darker than before, it is a place to hide!"
比日本的高級酒吧還貴。兩杯飲料加一杯汽水1500元…,It is more expensive than a high -end bar in Japan.Two cups of beverages plus a cup of soda 1500 yuan ...
在獨特的禪宗環境中調製出台灣最精心調製的雞尾酒。就走吧,"In the unique Zen environment, the most elaborate cocktails in Taiwan are used.Just leave"
調酒師/老闆是雞尾酒的專家。強烈推薦這個地方。,The bartender/boss is an expert at cocktail.Recommend this place strongly.
友好的日本調酒師認真對待他的工作。非常適合尋找安靜喝酒場所的孤獨旅行者,Friendly Japanese bartender treats his work seriously.It is very suitable for lone travelers who are looking for a quiet drinking place
由來自神奈川縣的日本人經營。  哈哈,Operated by Japanese from Kanagawa Prefecture.Ha ha
對自己的技能充滿信心固然很好，但你需要更好地照顧你的客戶。,"It is good to be confident in your skills, but you need to take care of your customers better."
"師父的反應是最糟糕的。
如果你不想受傷，最好不要去。","Master's response is the worst.
If you don't want to be injured, it's best not to go."
完美的宮殿，喝一杯👍👍👍 …,"Perfect palace, drink a cup ..."
這是一個非常好的空間。還有很多稀有飲料！可口的！,This is a very good space.There are many rare drinks!Affordable!
對於那些喜歡在輕鬆安靜的環境中喝上一兩杯的人來說，這是一個必去的地方,"For those who like to drink one or two cups in a relaxed and quiet environment, this is a must -have place"
台北市的精選馬尼,Selected Mani in Taipei City
很酷的酒吧。一定會回來的。調酒師超好。,Very cool bar.Will definitely come back.The bartender is super good.
非常好的飲料，但有點貴,"Very good drink, but a bit expensive"
