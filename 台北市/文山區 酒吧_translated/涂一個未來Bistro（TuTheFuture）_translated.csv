"菜色的部分：
白飯煮的很好，很喜歡。
吃過雞肉和叉燒，肉質本身還可以，但口感和調味沒有很合胃口。
蔬菜燙花椰，沒有剝皮，比較硬，菜芯冷冷的。
老實說除了白飯，菜肉很像是加熱食品...

環境與體驗：
1.服務：兩次去買單都站在櫃檯，乾等非常非常久，老闆看起來像剛畢業的大學生，對於客人的態度非常chill？隨便？。對於讓客人站在櫃檯乾等很久，並不感到抱歉。整個店面像是沒有人在工作一樣，要結帳找不到人。找到空檔就和朋友嘻鬧。

2.設備：店內播放的音樂很雜亂，年代、語言混亂的播放，猜測大概是某人的播放清單。網路和藍芽連線很差，歌曲斷斷續續的很恐怖。音響又大聲音質又差。耳朵飽受折磨，很想建議老闆寧缺勿濫。
另外，店內的桌椅是陽春、不舒服的。

總而言之，去了兩次都覺得好像誤闖了大學生家，微波便當、華而不實家具設備。無論是在餐點、環境和服務上，感覺不太到店家的用心。請再加油。","The dish part:
The rice is cooked very well and likes it very much.
After eating chicken and barbecued pork, the meat itself is okay, but the taste and seasoning did not have an appetite.
Vegetables are hot coconut, without peeling, relatively hard, the vegetable core is cold.
To be honest, in addition to rice, vegetable meat is very much like heating food ...

Environment and experience:
1. Services: Two times to buy orders, they are standing at the counter. They have been doing it for a long time. The boss looks like a college student who has just graduated. The attitude towards guests is very Chill?casual?EssenceIt is not sorry for the guests to stand at the counter for a long time.The entire store is like no one is working, and people cannot find someone.Find the empty gear and make trouble with your friends.

2. Equipment: The music played in the store is very messy. In the past and language chaotic playback, guess is probably someone's playlist.The connection between the Internet and Bluetooth is very poor, and the songs are very horrible.The sound quality is poor.The ears are tortured, and I want to recommend that the boss would rather not abandon.
In addition, the tables and chairs in the store are Yangchun and uncomfortable.

All in all, when I went twice, I felt that I had mistakenly broke through the college student's house, and the microwave bento and the real furniture equipment.Regardless of meals, environment and services, I feel that it is not very intentional.Come on.",False
