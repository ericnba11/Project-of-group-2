"吃了N年N次的smith & wollensky 卻一直沒有來他的姊妹店sea to sky解鎖🔒今天跟哥們約了晚餐要討論出國行程就一起來解鎖巨大藍絲絨蛋糕🍰但我覺得沒有smith & wollensky的巨大巧克力蛋糕好吃🤭但鮭魚威靈頓倒是挺令我驚豔的！碳烤肋眼牛排表現一般，但旁邊的野菇很讚！海鮮盤真的很一般可以跳過🤭兩杯調酒表現都不錯👌服務生態度挺好，嘴巴很甜，問他那杯調酒拍照最好看，居然回答：跟妳拍每杯都好看，這位小哥哥應該是走錯地方上班了🤣但會一直詢問他們好吃還是smith好吃這點真的有點妙🤣最後結帳當然用了「世界之極卡」打了五折，又省了近五千😎餐廳還送了Creed的小香水🥰

覺得下次應該直接晚一點來把他當酒吧喝調酒比較適合🤭🤭

今日餐點：
海鮮冷盤$2580➡️完全建議跳過
鮭魚威靈頓$3280➡️挺驚豔的
美國肋眼牛排$3280➡️表現一般
藍絲絨蛋糕$520➡️口感偏紮實
STS Aviation $420➡️酸甜適中
Desert Spring $420➡️酒香醇厚","Smith & Wollensky, who had eaten for N years and N times, has never come to his sister shop Sea to Sky unlock 🔒 Today I madely dinner with buddies to discuss the travel abroad and unlock the huge blue velvet cake. The huge chocolate cake is delicious, but the salmon Wellington is quite amazing!Carbon grilled rib eye steaks are average, but the wild mushrooms next to it are very good!The seafood plate can really skip the two cups of bartender. The performance is very good at service. The mouth is very sweet. Ask him the best cup of bartender to take pictures. Answer: Every cup with you is good -looking, it looks good. This little brother should go to work in the wrong place, but he will always ask them to be delicious or smit. This is really a bit wonderful. Nearly 5,000 restaurants also gave Creed's small perfume 🥰

I think it should be more suitable for drinking him as a bar next time.

Today's meal:
Seafood cold plate $ 2580盘️ It all suggests skipping
Salmon Weixin $ 3280➡️ Very amazing
American rib eye steak $ 3280➡️
Blue velvet cake $ 520➡️ The taste is solid

"氣氛不錯，景色很好，服務也很棒，菜色也介紹的詳細，只是菜色吃起來沒有很驚艷的感覺！但氣氛、景色真的加分不少！
蟹肉甜甜圈很好吃，但一份只有兩個，價格上應該是包含了氣氛價。
西班牙海鮮燉飯的飯量很薄一層，飯量稍嫌不足，但海鮮食材新鮮，只是價位不太符合比例原則。
蛤蠣巧達湯將軟法放在湯裡面，吃起來很入味，多了一層次感，然奶油味道非常非常濃郁，多人分享比較不會有負擔。
紅絲絨蛋糕中間那層白色應該是乳酪，因為是在吃蛋糕，主要不是在吃乳酪或內餡，搶奪了蛋糕體的主要味蕾，乳酪過於紮實。一切下去，蛋糕及乳酪（內餡）會分開，感覺沒有mix在一起，不太符合胃口。","The atmosphere is good, the scenery is very good, the service is great, and the dishes are also introduced in detail, but the dishes do not feel amazing!But the atmosphere and scenery are really a lot of points!
Crab meat donuts are delicious, but there are only two copies, and the price should contain the price of the atmosphere.
The amount of rice stewed in Spain is a thin layer, and the amount of rice is slightly insufficient, but the seafood ingredients are fresh, but the price is not in line with the principle of proportion.
Clade Qianda Decoction puts the soft method in the soup. It tastes very delicious and has a layer of sense. However, the cream tastes very, very strong, and it will not be burdensome when sharing.
The white velvet cake should be cheese in the middle of the red velvet cake, because it is eating cakes, mainly not eating cheese or filling, robbing the main taste buds of the cake body, and the cheese is too solid.Everything goes down, cakes and cheese (filling) will be separated. It feels that there is no MIX together, and it is not in line with appetite.",False

🍴日本F1菲力牛排5oz.、楓糖地瓜泥、紅酒醬 $3880 :另外一份是菲力牛排，比較少的地方有這款牛可以食得到，他們建議為三成熟😱，起初都覺得比較生，難入口，但是他這款牛的三成熟竟然剛剛好，口感獨特，較軟嫩🤤，切的時候沒有血水，反而如果將它煮成五成熟就會變硬，這就是菲力的威力🤫，味道方面不是一般的比較濃，這個部位是較為淡，所以整體不會太膩，是不錯唷😋😋

幾乎都是馬上就來補水，餐點也都十分滿意，

到要結帳的時候，我都已經起身了，那位女服務員才過來說我們是桌邊結帳，我又很錯愕的坐回位子上。你若是要桌邊邊結帳不應該要提前說嗎？
我們已經很明顯已經吃飽準備離開了，怎麼會一副我好像不想結帳要跑走的感覺，然後把我們攔下來？這是我感受最糟糕的一個地方，希望能加強那位女員工的訓練。","The service attitude that I just entered the store is very good
The dishes are also delicious
At the beginning, the service attitude of the male waiter was very good. I observed what I needed. I can solve my problem immediately. The introduction of the meal is also very careful. It is worthy of praise.
When I ate half of it, I felt that the air conditioner was a bit cold. I wanted to find a waiter. Looking back, I saw the female employee always slipped the tablet. Later, a seemingly male person came to serve me. The female employee still slip Shop or something, shouldn't you always pay attention to whether the guests need to serve?
When I was about to check the checkout, I had got up, and the waitress came to say that we were at the table at the table, and I sat back on the seat very wrong.If you want to check on the side of the table, shouldn't you say it in advance?

完全不踩雷欸～～真令我驚艷！這間是我吃過最好吃的牛排，而且，所有我點的東西，全都是好吃的，連哈魯哥都讚不絕口🥹 我必須說，很少有牛排讓我不吐掉的（好像是那種咬不爛的筋我都會吐掉🥹），這間的牛排處理方式我非常滿意🩷

我們沒有點套餐，我們都是想吃什麼就點什麼的單點模式，不想被制約而且也沒有那個年紀去吃那麼多東西了，所以…很可惜，本來有飯後甜點，後來取消了，因為我真的飽到肚子有點痛了😅

"服務超上道、景觀美、食物佳，同價位裡面目前最推的餐廳。

這裡的服務員真的訓練有素，魔鬼藏在細節裡：英文溝通沒問題🆗、上菜會先從主位開始、倒酒🍷前不會打斷我們會等我們把話講完、每一道菜都會更換餐具跟餐盤、會清理桌上的麵包屑…等，高級商業聚餐就應該來這種地方。包廂很寬敞，可以容納30個人左右低消8萬，風景絕佳，大推👍

開胃菜：
- 馬里蘭蟹餅：大推！是很特殊沒吃過的蟹肉料理方式，可以吃出蟹肉的鮮甜與餅鬆軟的口感，單吃就很美味，料理佐的沾醬裡面有松露我反而不是很喜歡。
- 季節生蠔盤：只有提供兩人份，需要加價$999，生蠔🦪很新鮮很大顆，最驚艷之處是隨餐路上的辣醬，有炒過香香辣辣的很提味。

湯品：
- 杏茅馬賽海鮮湯：蝦味很濃郁，跟五之神的蝦醬沾麵很類似。
- 帕瑪森番茄蔬菜湯 ：起司和番茄🍅味非常濃郁，前幾口好喝，但因為太濃的關係後面有點膩而且有點佔胃。

熱開胃菜：
- 香煎北海道干貝：干貝見得恰到好處，上面有用魚子醬點綴，佐醬很加分，醬好吃到想用湯匙挖來喝。

主餐：
- 美式經典火烤海陸盤 The STS Surf & Turf（兩人份）：包含了炭烤波士頓龍蝦、美國頂級肋眼牛排，不含服務費$6980，平均一人加服務費接近4000台幣。龍蝦🦞殼有處理過，用刀叉就可以食用，肉質嫩且帶有淡淡的奶油香。牛排大約三分熟，看起來很生但是完全沒有血水，牛肉已經有調味過，不用任何沾醬鹹度就很適中，肉質嫩中帶有嚼勁，完勝Lawry’s 的牛排。
- 副餐的部分，享受玉米筍、花椰菜🥦其實不需要另外點，主餐本來就有包含一些了，這我們當時不知道，一份附餐大約300左右，份量很多，適合大約三到五人分食。

甜點：
- 提拉米蘇：有淡淡的咖啡味沒有酒味，甜度適中不膩，我個人蠻喜歡的。
- 每日經典：當天提供的是伯爵泡芙，泡芙有點軟、不夠脆，但伯爵慕斯茶味很香。","The service is superior, the landscape is beautiful, and the food is good. The currently most pushed restaurant in the same price.

The waiters here are really well trained. The devil hides in the details: there is no problem in English communication. The food will start from the main position, and we will not interrupt before pouring the wine. We will wait for us to finish the words. They will change the tableware, the dishes, the bread crumbs on the table, etc., and the high -end commercial dinner should come to this kind of place.The box is very spacious, and it can accommodate about 30 people to disappear 80,000. The scenery is excellent.

Apocal vegetables:
-Malilan crab cake: big push!It is a very special method of crab meat that has not been eaten. You can eat the sweetness of crab meat and the soft taste of cakes. It is delicious when you eat it. I do n’t like truffle in the dipping sauce.
-Sexyn oyster plate: Only two people are provided, and the price is $ 999. The oysters are very fresh and very large. The most amazing thing is that it is hot sauce on the road.

Soup:
-Mima Marseille Seafood Soup: The shrimp flavor is very strong, which is similar to the shrimp sauce of the God.
-Pamson Tomato Vegetable Soup: The cheese and tomato are very strong. The first few mouthfuls are delicious, but because it is too strong, it is a bit greasy and a bit of stomach.

Hot appetizer:
-Can fried Bei Dao scallops: The scallops are just right. It is embellished with caviar with caviar. The sauce is very extra points.

Main meal:
-Su American classic fire roasted sea land plate The STS Surf & Turf (two people): Including charcoal Boston lobster, US top ribs of ribs, without service fees for $ 6980, the average person plus service fee is close to 4,000 Taiwan dollars.The lobster shell has been treated, and it can be eaten with a knife and fork. The meat is tender and has a faint creamy fragrance.The steak is about three minutes, it looks very raw but there is no blood at all. The beef has been seasoned. It is very moderate without any sauce. The meat is chewy in the tender meat, which is better than Lawry ’s steak.
-The part of the meal, enjoying corn bamboo shoots and broccoli, there is no need to order separately. The main meal originally contained some. We did n’t know at the time. Slim.

dessert:
-Tiramisu: There is a faint flavor of coffee without wine, and the sweetness is moderate and not greasy. I personally like it.
-The daily classic: The puff was provided on the day. The puffs were a bit soft and not crispy, but the poustone mousse tea flavor was very fragrant.",False

"這家應該是我近期遇過最地雷的餐廳，這次來用餐是為了慶生
價格上偏高價位，所以心理預期服務和菜色應該要有一定的水準，包含事先網路上做一些小功課，所以其實蠻期待的。

先說最大不滿的地雷點，奉勸有去用餐的各位千萬別點“馬賽海鮮湯”，那味道之神秘，很像各種動物內臟去熬煮的湯加上蝦子還有螃蟹等，喝起來有種中藥味道，中後段有一個很可怕的苦味，一開始我們還覺得可能是我們沒嘗試過這種特別的湯品是我們知識薄弱，但越喝越奇怪，喝到後來覺得很想吐，但為了不浪費我免搶喝到剩下一半，旁邊年輕服務生很貼心，聽到我們在討論這碗湯，馬上過來詢問，也是跟我們老實說今天有也有其他客人反應湯品有奇怪味道，之前是不會這樣，我們頓時很錯愕，他就說他會再去跟廚房確認，結果就沒有結果。

等到後來主菜上，由另外一名感覺比較位階高的主管服務生來，我才又口頭詢問剛剛那碗湯是發生什麼事，他又請我稍等一下去詢問廚師（所以剛剛沒人去反應？），後來來跟我說，廚師剛剛試喝覺得沒問題，所以基本上可能是口味上大家覺得不一樣？想卸責逃避責任？然後一直很急著把他們的想法講完，不給我講？這邊我要補充，我口氣和態度都是微笑並用好奇的心態在詢問，並沒有刁難他們，結果當我們主餐用時的差不多，他們又突然上一道前面的湯品，跟我說這是廚師剛剛研究後再重新煮過來，請我在品嚐，結果這次確實正常多，但不就是打你們的臉嗎？然後跟我說可能是前面有加酒的關係導致苦味，所以這就是你們菜色湯品的SOP品管嗎？每次用餐的品質都不一樣？是這個意思嗎？

不過當下我也只是試過2口，確實比第一次上的湯品正常多，覺得ok就沒再喝了，因為喝下去都是剛剛有苦味的陰影，早就不想嘗試，而且你們危機處理也已經過來當下最適合送湯的時候，完全不及格，還要我反應才有動作，是覺得客人好欺負嗎？ 後面的處理就是把其中一杯飲料給免單，然後又接著說他們餐廳比較美式，所以服務費請我們自由勾選，這邊的體驗是極差的，已經心情不太好還在那邊提服務費，我本來有想勾選5%，想到剛剛的體驗直接果斷勾0%，真的是非常扣分。

此外，還有看到有人跟我感受一樣，很多餐具都沒有及時更換，上一道用的餐具沒更換，用舊餐具直接品嘗下一道？我們遇到的是上前菜前的麵包用餐叉具，上面沾滿奶油，沒幫我們更換，直接讓我們用來吃精緻的前菜，後來他們好像有發現忘記換，結果只幫我女伴換，我的沒換到，我真的滿臉問號，如果你們的服務品質是這樣，那真的沒那個資格跟客人要服務費。

我們點了雙人套餐，吃下來8千多，這價位比起其他同等級的景觀餐廳，真的整體差很多，價位到位，服務菜色不到位，主菜的龍蝦蠻硬蠻乾的，感覺是冷凍很久，這點我知道很難做到新鮮，但還是要說一下。小蛋糕上來時，沒有主動問客人是否需要幫忙合照（我去過其他台北的景觀餐廳，每家都會主動詢問，可能你們不想打擾客人，但有問就是有加分），好的地方是櫃檯接待的小姐很親切也很細心，我們報到時，她眼睛有即時先偷偷看我有沒有另外帶蛋糕，反應非常快速，執得肯定。

今天好加在是我各種三寸不爛之舌，把很多很糟的體驗在女伴面前各種輕鬆帶過，也給你們面子，不想破壞慶生的氣氛，讓女伴在生日當天對於這家餐廳留下不好回憶，如果是其他情況下去用餐發生這樣的事情，我一定跟你們反應到底，不會給你們面子，跟本在欺負客人，建議有遇到奇怪狀況的人，可以當下馬上反應，不要讓餐廳矇混過去。

題外話，想去拍些網美照的朋友，建議中午去用餐，晚上座位靠近廁所靠窗那邊燈光比較亮比較好拍，我們做到偏暗的另一邊，氛圍好但拍照悲劇，座位不能指定全憑運氣，手機iphone 14以上或是Android近兩年新手機才能比較好拍出不錯的照片，但平均曝光會開啟夜景模式大概3秒，我有帶相機去幫女伴拍，數值在快門1/80，光圈F2.8，iso 16000以上，給大家參考。

果然跟懂吃的朋友說的一樣，就是賣景觀，其他別期望太高。
下次不會再去，一次生意一次客人
餐廳有看到這個評論的話，希望你們可以痛定思痛，反省檢討你們的服務和菜色，才能永續經營。

如果大家堅持有去不怕讓另一半生氣的，或想給餐廳機會，還是可以挑戰看看。

以上","This family should be the restaurant I have recently met the most mines.
The price is high, so psychological expectations and dishes should have a certain level, including doing some small homework on the Internet in advance, so it is quite expected.

Let's talk about the biggest dissatisfaction point first. Do not order ""Marseille Seafood Soup"" for everyone who goes to dine. There is a terrible bitter taste in the middle and back stages. At the beginning, we still feel that it may be that we have not tried this special soup. It is weak. But in order not to waste half of the remaining half, the young waiter next to me was very intimate. I heard that we were discussing this bowl of soup and immediately came to ask. It was honest with us. Today, there are other guests who have a strange taste. It wouldn't be like this before, and we were suddenly confused. He said that he would go to confirm with the kitchen, but there was no result.

When the main cuisine later, from another supervisor who felt a higher level, I verbally asked what happened to the bowl of soup. He asked me to ask the chef. Reaction?) Later, I told me that the chef just tried to drink it, so it might be that everyone thinks different in the taste?Want to escape responsibility?Then I was in a hurry to finish their ideas, don't tell me?I have to add here. I have a smile and attitude with a curious attitude. I did not make difficulties. As a result, when our main meal was used, they suddenly took the previous soup in front, telling me that this is the chef After I just studied it, I was cooked again. Please taste it. As a result, this time is really much normal, but isn't it just hitting your face?Then I told me that there may be a relationship of adding wine before, so is this the SOP quality tube of your dish soup?The quality of each meal is different?Does this mean?

However, I have just tried 2 sitors at the moment. It is indeed much more normal than the first soup. I feel that OK I did n’t drink anymore, because it ’s a shadow that I just had a bitter taste. I don’t want to try it. It has also come to the time when it is most suitable for soup, it is completely faulty, and I want me to react to move. Do you think the guests are bullying?The subsequent treatment is to give one of the drinks to the free order, and then then say that their restaurant is more beautiful, so please check us freely. The experience here is very bad. In charge, I originally wanted to check 5%. I thought that the experience of just tipping 0%was really deducted.

In addition, there are people who see someone feel like me. Many tableware has not been replaced in time. The tableware used in the previous way has not been replaced. Use old tableware to taste the next way?What we encountered is the for fork set of bread before going forward dishes. It is covered with cream on it and did not help us replace it. Let us use delicate front dishes. Later, they seemed to have forgotten to change. I didn't change it. I really have a question mark. If your service quality is the case, then there is really no qualification to ask for a service fee with the guests.

We ordered a double set meal and eaten more than 8,000. This price is much worse than other landscape restaurants of the same level. The overall price is in place. The service dishes are not in place. I know it is difficult to be fresh, but I still have to talk about it.When the small cake came up, I did not take the initiative to ask the guests if they needed to help take a photo (I have been to other Taipei landscape restaurants, and each one will take the initiative to ask. Maybe you don’t want to disturb the guests, but if you ask, there is a bonus). The good place is the counter reception at the counter reception. The young lady was very kind and careful. When we reported, she had a secret eye to see if I had another cake. The response was very fast, and she was sure.

Today is my all kinds of three -inch tongues. I bring a lot of bad experiences in front of the female companion, and give you face, do not want to destroy the atmosphere of birthday, let the female companion treat this on this day of this day for this day for this day for this day. The restaurant's restaurant is not good at memories. If it is in other cases, such a thing happens, I must respond to you to the end. React, don't let the restaurant confuse.

For out of the question, I want to take some friends who take some net photos. I suggest going to dinner at noon. At night, the seats are near the toilet and the lights on the window are brighter and better. We have a darker side. The atmosphere is good Specify the full luck, the mobile phone iPhone is above 14 or more or Android new mobile phones in the past two years can be better to take good photos, but the average exposure will start the night view mode for about 3 seconds. I have a camera to help the female accompaniment. 1/80, aperture F2.8, ISO 16,000, for your reference.

Sure enough, as the friends who know about eating are selling the landscape, other expectations are too high.
I won't go again next time, a business once a guest
If you see this comment on the restaurant, I hope you can paint your pain and reflect on your services and dishes in order to continue to operate.

If you are not afraid of making the other half angry, or if you want to give the restaurant a chance, you can still challenge it.

所以我也很直接的詢問服務生是否可以幫忙處理，因為我們兩個沒有一個人會使用，但服務生也只是比劃了一下器具跟龍蝦本體說：「你們就從這裡固定然後把肉夾起來就好。」
的確我們不會用可以學，但今天好歹我們有負擔服務費，不管多少，是否解決客人的問題也是其中一項服務？
然後最生氣的是燉飯整盤都是冷的，不是熱的也不是溫的，是冷的，這盤餐點真的很不值得這個價錢。

After all, the two of us did not eat the crustaceans. Those who have dealt with the shell have been handled, and we have not thought that we have to deal with it ourselves.
So I also directly asked whether the waiter could help handle it, because none of us will use it, but the waiter just compared the appliance and lobster body, ""Fixed it from here and then clip the meat and then put it up. good.""
Indeed, we will not use it to learn, but today we have a burden on service fees. No matter how much, is it one of the services to solve the problem of guests?
Then the most angry thing is that the whole plate of the stew is cold, not hot nor warm, it is cold. This dish is really not worth the price.

"位在信義微風47樓的高樓餐廳，他們標榜的是股神巴菲特最喜歡的牛排餐廳Smith & wollensky 牛排館的另一個品牌，主打的是海鮮料理，所以自然不會選擇來這裡點牛排吃了，一進門就感覺到大海的藍色氛圍，黑板上還用粉筆寫了本日推薦的海鮮，瞬間覺得有點回到以前在南加州海邊餐廳裝潢的回憶了，很有美式風格，但從高樓層看出去的城市景像一望無際突然又把我拉回現實了！
一開始就先點了生蠔來配香檳，整個胃口就先打開了，沙拉和前菜的章魚和海鮮湯吃完就覺得差不多要飽了，接著看到主菜的鹽烤午仔魚的份量差點暈倒了，還好吃魚的負擔感覺沒那麼大，調味也很簡單的只有鹽和萊姆汁加橄欖油，但是當我看到蛋糕上來後真的有點嚇傻了，勉勉強強吃了一些就打包了，下次要記得美式餐廳的份量，再惦惦自己的食量已經越來越小了，當然服務人員的努力付出也不能忘了按個讚了！👍","It is located on the high -rise restaurant on the 47th floor of Xinyi Breeze.

At the beginning, I ordered the oyster to match the champagne. The whole appetite was opened first. The octopus and seafood soup of the salad and the former vegetables felt almost full.

"Smith & Wollensky的姊妹店，位於47樓的高空景觀視野超讃！從一出電梯的整個空間感就讓人覺得很舒適，服務人員態度非常的親切溫暖，服務也很貼心，加水的次數非常的頻繁，完全不需要客人提醒，該注意的細節也都有注意到，沒什麼可以挑剔的。

餐點非常的好吃，我點的主菜是海鮮盤，非常的新鮮美味，龍蝦肉非常的Q彈多汁，前菜的鰤魚薄片的醬汁也令我印象深刻，甜甜的草莓冰淇淋原本以為就是一球普通的冰淇淋，但有淋上了一些cheesecake bits，所以吃起來口感非常好！

今天來用餐的時候人沒有太多，環境非常舒適安靜，餐廳店也有很多大小不同的包廂，是商務用餐非常好的選擇！

唯一要雞蛋裡挑骨頭的話應該是大樓的電梯！到高樓層餐廳的電梯只有兩部，所以在用餐時間像是中午12點，或是用餐結束兩點左右的時間電梯非常的難等，常常要等二三輪才能等到，對於趕時間的商務客人來說是必須注意的細節！","Smith & Wollensky's sister shop, high -altitude view of the 47th floor!The whole sense of space from the elevator has made people feel very comfortable, the attitude of the service staff is very kind and warm, the service is very intimate, the number of water is very frequent.

The meal is very delicious. My main dish is a seafood plate, which is very fresh and delicious. The lobster meat is very Q bomb juice. I thought it was an ordinary ice cream, but some cheesecake bits were dripped, so it tastes very good!

The atmosphere of the bar is pretty good
Belongs to low -key and quiet types

"Smith& Wollensky在微風信義的姐妹店，主打海鮮。一出電梯就被動態海洋影像吸引了目光，裝潢設計也以藍色海洋色系為主。主廚每天親挑新鮮魚貨，餐點跟服務都很到位。只是覺得今天的馬賽魚湯偏鹹了點，海膽義大利麵有點太creamy ,沒有把海膽表現得當。加州卷不錯吃，不要錯過，鹽焗魚也很有特色。藍絲絨蛋糕必點。總之，餐點跟用餐環境都還不錯。","Smith & WOLLENSKY is in the sisters' shop of Breeze, mainly seafood.As soon as the elevator was out, it was attracted to the dynamic marine image, and the decoration design was mainly blue marine colors.The chef picks up fresh fish goods every day, and the meals and services are in place.I just feel that the Marseille Soup is a bit salty today, and the sea urchin has a bit too creamy, and does not show the sea urchin properly.California rolls well, don't miss it, salted fish is also very distinctive.The blue velvet cake must be ordered.In short, the meals and the dining environment are not bad.",False

身處在台灣這樣四面環海漁貨滿滿的島嶼， 我實在是想不出來為什麼需要花這樣的錢坐在這間好像只有裝潢的美式“海鮮”餐廳。如果說這間主打的是海鮮，那麼他的海鮮的鮮度應該要配的上他的價位，生食新鮮度很勉強。熟食烹調也不及格， 不管是主打的鹽烤魚， 牛奶蛤通通都料理過熟而失去海鮮的甜味和水分。海鮮燉飯跟馬賽海鮮湯的調味實在是很驚人的糟糕，即便在國外也沒吃過調味如此水土不服。 唯一覺得不錯的是戰斧豬排， 是否該考慮只賣豬排就好呢？ 說的夜景， 這能說不用太期待， 因為外窗的玻璃實在是太髒看出去的視線有點朦朧。 服務的話，可能是因為新開幕，感覺人員訓練有帶加強，反應不夠快和即時，有時候三請四請才收空盤和倒水。,"In the island full of fisheries around the sea like Taiwan, I really can't think of why you need to spend money on this American ""seafood"" restaurant that seems to be decorated.If this is the focus of seafood, then the freshness of his seafood should be worthy of his price, and the freshness of raw food is very reluctant.Cooked food and cooking are not good. Whether it is the main salt grilled fish, the milk clams are cooked and losing the sweetness and moisture of seafood.The seasoning of seafood stewed rice and Marseille Seafood Soup is really amazing. Even if you have never been seasoning abroad, you have not been unconvinced.The only thing I think is the warfare ax pork chop. Should I consider selling only pork chops?The night view, it can be said that it does not expect too much, because the glass of the outer window is too dirty to see the sight.If you serve, it may be because of the new opening.

主餐海鮮都挺新鮮的，他們也很貼心都已經有把蟹腳切開了，讓你比較方便吃，牛肉的話當下吃有點硬，沒有像他們姐妹家的入口即化，不過帶回家後再吃變得很好吃🤣龍蝦海鮮飯的飯是偏硬的口感，個人蠻喜歡

微風信義47樓的高空餐廳，落地窗是內湖方向，沒有特別景觀，想要觀看101，必須到餐廳對面的戶外酒吧。餐廳今年的餐飲品質和口味有明顯上升，海鮮和肉類都十分推薦，不知如何下手單點的人，建議可選擇套餐。當晚最驚艷的是干貝，海膽，龍蝦和烤魚，雖然是主打海鮮的餐廳，但和牛腓力也很美味。晚餐的小插曲是續點的美式咖啡很淡，喝了幾口之後和服務人員反應，立即換上現作的咖啡，同桌其他人員也得到免費的續杯，服務態度值得讚許。,"The high -altitude restaurant on the 47th floor of Breeze is the direction of the lake.

牛排有點柴及過熟，吃了才想到上菜前也沒被問過要幾分熟⋯
海鮮部分表現相對穩定，店名有個sea字有差。
甜點的蛋糕份量驚人，但味道令人遺憾⋯如果有訂過網路上的造型蛋糕的話大概就是那種味道，一入口滿滿的化學甜味，身為螞蟻人真的對這蛋糕很失望。
以上是情人節套餐的感想。
未來還有機會的話大概只會嘗試海鮮類了。","First of all, the landscape is not good, but the field is not banned. If you are not lucky, you may have to eat and smoke.

The steak is a bit of firewood and too familiar, but after eating, I thought that I had never been asked about it before going to the food ...
The performance of the seafood is relatively stable, and the name of the store has a poor character.
The cake of the dessert is amazing, but the taste is regrettable. If you have a styling cake on the Internet, it is probably that kind of taste. The chemical sweetness of the mouth is really disappointed with this cake.

來體驗一下這一個高檔，高層高價餐廳，今天點中午套餐，套餐內容分量還可以，但是美味程度以這種價格來說，我認為是一般，龍蝦套餐的龍蝦太小，肉很少，雙人套餐的牛排蠻大塊的，也很厚，份量比較足一些，不過口感太有點柴，還不如costco的牛排好吃。另外，單點咖啡，咖啡很小杯喝幾口就沒有了，這家餐廳最特別是藍絲絨蛋糕，裡面有非常厚實的奶酪，整個蛋糕很大，如果沒有三四個人一起吃的話，確實是吃不完，但是口味我認為噱頭大於口感，服務生很親切，服務很好，及時的換盤子。結論認為，CP值太低，口味一般，外面的城市景觀其實也不怎麼樣，雖然樓層蠻高的，看出去的景色也並非很好看。,"Come and experience this high -end, high -level high -priced restaurant, order lunch package today, the content of the package is OK, but in terms of deliciousness, I think it is average.

從我們靠窗的桌子上可以看到令人印象深刻的景色。  烤魚符合我的期望，但地中海味道並不突出。  裡面塞滿了迷迭香和其他草藥，應該帶有淡淡的草本味。   不幸的是它很簡單。  只有檸檬調味料。  羊肉相當不錯。  最令人興奮的部分是它的露台，我們可以在那裡抽雪茄😀😀😀,"We can see the impressive scenery from the table of our window.Baked fish meets my expectations, but the Mediterranean taste is not prominent.It is full of rosemary and other herbal medicines, and it should have a faint herb.Unfortunately it is simple.Only lemon seasonings.Lamb is pretty good.The most exciting part is its terrace, where we can smoke cigars there 😀😀😀",False

您想在餐廳門口吃飯嗎？你在用酒吧嗎？我被問到。就像，“去吃飯？還是去酒吧？”左邊是一家餐廳，在大樓內，所以不冷。由於我們使用的是酒吧，因此我們被引導到右側的相反方向。夏天你可以待在戶外，冬天寒冷的時候你可以用透明的塑膠布覆蓋這裡。當我說：“這裡很冷！”時，她解釋說：“別擔心，我會帶暖氣的。”

他還帶來了兩個大加熱器。真的很溫暖。加熱器太熱了，我以為它會讓整個區域變得乾燥。正如預期的那樣。

那裡的景色非常好。前面還可以看到台北101。夜景非常美麗。

Try something on the menu, but the best thing I can say is um.
Their signature blue velvet cake is dry and shaken.

One star is given to Afga, and the other star is given to employees.",False
食物很好，景色很棒，服務很棒。肯定會再次訪問。為團隊豎起大拇指。,"The food is very good, the scenery is great, and the service is great.Will definitely visit again.Lift your thumb for the team.",False
我帶著一位海外朋友來到這裡。酒吧決定今天任意關閉以進行“消毒”。接電話的人一點也不同情我浪費時間穿過半個城鎮來到這家旅館花錢，儘管他們決定在營業時間內關門。當你試圖解釋說，如果你的營業時間不穩定，那麼如果你有隨機關門的風險，那就會浪費顧客來你的店的時間。然而，該名員工決定掛斷我的電話。迄今為止我經歷過的最粗魯的客戶服務。我將跟進管理層。,"I came here with an overseas friend.The bar decides to be arbitrarily closed today for ""disinfection"".The person who answered the phone did not sympathize with me at all. I waste time through half of the town and came to this hotel to spend money, although they decided to close the door during business hours.When you try to explain that if your business hours are unstable, then if you have the risk of random officials, you will waste your time when you come to your shop.However, the employee decided to hang up my phone.So far, the rude customer service I have experienced.I will follow up the management.",False
"來這裡吃聖誕夜前的晚餐。地方收費 6k 加上服務可能是我在這個價格點吃過的最糟糕的擺盤和食物。基本上我沒有拍食物的照片，這告訴你一些事情......如果我在那個價格點沒有拍照片，那基本上就是食物有多糟糕。我問了我們旁邊的桌子。第一次來這家餐廳真是太糟糕了。

不過室外露台區域很不錯。","Come here for dinner before Christmas Eve.Local charging 6K plus service may be the worst set and food I have eaten at this price.Basically, I didn't take pictures of food, which tells you something ... If I didn't take a photo at that price, it was basically how bad the food was.I asked the table next to us.It's so bad to come to this restaurant for the first time.

But the outdoor terrace area is very good.",False
"一頓體面的高級餐，價格公道。服務有時有點笨拙，但很友善、周到，但不會打擾到您。

清蒸北蛤
高超。巨大的蛤蜊，煮熟後配上在肉湯中煮熟的切片蔥。完美的開始！

一杯夏布利酒——一切都井然有序。

伊比利亞火腿南瓜湯
一道不錯的湯。火腿的作用是改變質地並帶來一點鹽和鹹味。

烤章魚配小土豆
紮實的努力。章魚很嫩，但咬起來。壓倒性的香腸塊完全沒有必要，所有添加的鹹味也是不必要的。章魚的基準是義大利的 polpo e patate（只有兩種主要成分）和希臘的章魚，它的皮鬆脆黏稠。

馬裡蘭蟹餅
好的。非常潮濕。醬汁融入蛋糕:(焦糖化程度很差。不應搭配辛辣的玉米沙拉，而應搭配新鮮的苦葉。

8 盎司濕熟紐約帶
體面，比例大，切得恰到好處，煎得恰到好處，煮至三分熟。搭配的蔬菜適當清淡。蒜片不錯。缺點：牛排調味不均勻——有些地方超鹹，有些地方幾乎不鹹。如果您在供應牛排時使用優質食鹽，則肉需要均勻地稍微調味不足。否則的話，這可能會很棒。

一杯馬爾貝克——一切都井然有序。

肥美的鮪魚蟹佐飛子飯
我的意思是，它很好，但我真的不知道它在這個菜單上做什麼。看起來完全不合時宜。

免費水果
我不想要這個。別給我這個。我已經多吃了兩份海鮮開胃菜了。獼猴桃不是我在這裡的首要任務。

太妃糖香草冰淇淋
高超。真正的贏家。非常光滑而且絕對美味。配上製作精良的香蕉脆餅－不錯的選擇。

黑咖啡
不錯的過濾器。光滑而略帶甜味，而不是泥土般的濃鬱。相當咖啡因的刺激。

藍絲絨蛋糕（藍莓）
外表看起來很可怕，但實際上非常好。海綿很輕但很堅固。奶油不是特別甜，有清爽的柑橘味。
注意：我沒有訂購這個；他們把它給了我們，我們把它帶回家。咖啡後我沒有點第二份甜點。我不是怪物。","A decent meal, fair price.Sometimes the service is a little clumsy, but it is friendly and thoughtful, but it will not disturb you.

Steamed North Clam
superb.The huge clams are cooked with the sliced ​​sliced ​​onion in the broth.Perfect start!

A glass of Charlie -everything is orderly.

Iberian ham pumpkin soup
A good soup.The role of ham is to change the texture and bring a little salt and salty flavor.

Baked octopus with small potatoes
Solid efforts.The octopus is tender, but bites.The overwhelming sausages are completely unnecessary, and all the added salty taste is unnecessary.The benchmark of octopus is Italian Polpo E Patt (only two main ingredients) and Greek octopus, and its skin is crispy and sticky.

Maryland crab cake
OKVery humid.The sauce is incorporated into the cake: (caramel is very poor. It should not be paired with spicy corn salad, but should be paired with fresh bitter leaves.

8 ounces of Wet New York Belt
Decent, the proportion is large, and the cut is just right.The matching vegetables are appropriate and light.Good garlic slices.Disadvantages: Steak seasonings are uneven -some places are super salty, and some places are almost not salty.If you use high -quality salt when supplying steaks, the meat needs to be slightly insufficient.Otherwise, this may be great.

A glass of Malbeck -everything is orderly.

Fat catfish crab Safeiko rice
I mean, it is good, but I really don't know what it does on this menu.It looks completely out of time.

Free fruit
I don't want this.Don't give me this.I have eaten two more seafood appetizers.Kiwi is not my primary task here.

Taifei candy vanilla ice cream
superb.Real winner.Very smooth and absolutely delicious.Coupled with the fine banana crisp cake -a good choice.

Black coffee
Good filter.Smooth and slightly sweet, not soil -like richness.Quite caffeine stimulus.

Blue velvet cake (blueberry)
The appearance looks terrible, but it is actually very good.The sponge is light but strong.Cream is not particularly sweet, with a refreshing citrus flavor.
Note: I did not order this; they gave it to us and we took it home.I didn't order the second dessert after coffee.I am not a monster.",False
就其本身而言，價格過高。如果您正在尋找高端海鮮店，那麼 Wellensky 可以在服務、擺盤和價值方面為您提供更多服務。很難證明這個地方合理。這並不是說它不好。這是一個競爭非常激烈的細分市場，就價格而言，你可以獲得更好的產品。不會回來。,"As far as it is concerned, the price is too high.If you are looking for high -end seafood stores, WelLensky can provide you with more services in terms of service, setting and value.It is difficult to prove that this place is reasonable.This does not mean that it is not good.This is a very competitive market segment.
