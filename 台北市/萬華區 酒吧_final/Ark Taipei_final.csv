我深深覺得每一天的狀況都不一定一樣
我分享我的，你分享你的
不用去揣測、判定別人當天的狀況
幫補血在我眼裡看來對我當天的體驗並沒有絲毫的改變

這句→「但是大概可以明白為什麼有人會覺得歌永遠都唱不太到的感覺」
回覆：沒有唷，我去的當天10:00~04:00六個小時歌都沒有來
沒有感覺，就是真的沒唱到。

還有這段→「真的想唱歌的人就去KTV就好，要在這裡唱到高興的確是不太可能呀，酒吧就是要喝酒聊天交朋友才是重點」
回覆：我們來看一下我在2023/07/11截下的該店臉書簡介
『Ark Taipei
我們是一間卡啦OK酒吧
歡迎來這裡一同歡笑、大聲歌唱、飲酒
一起?』

既然標榜卡拉ok酒吧，唱歌的比例佔了許多
真的想唱歌的人當天應該都已經在KTV了吧
一首都沒有來，是否因為去卡拉OK酒吧的這個動機已經少了一半
會想去就是想唱一點歌然後跟朋友喝酒聊天
這有很難理解嗎 ?

小龍你這樣有懂了嗎?","6/10 In the evening, please help your friends to help the song at 10 o'clock

No need to speculate and judge the situation of others on the day
In my eyes, it seems that my experience in my day has not changed the slightest.

Reply: No, I did n’t come from 10: 00 ~ 04:00 on the day I went.
I didn't feel it, but I really didn't sing.

There is also this paragraph → ""It is not possible to sing here to sing here when you really want to sing. It is really unlikely to sing here.

Since the karaoke bar is advertised, the proportion of singing accounts for a lot
People who really want to sing should already be in KTV that day, right?
Didn't the capital come? Is it because of this motivation to go to the karaoke bar?
If you want to go, you want to sing a little song and drink and chat with friends
Is this difficult to understand?

雖然環境很棒，地點也不錯，但點歌規則要再加強，我覺得桌數多，如果照貴店這樣一桌一單輪的話，單桌的單只能先一首，也就是說不可以一桌先唱個3首再換下一桌，這樣真的會唱不到；如果還是照原本的方式一桌可以限點三首的話，我建議就像是錢櫃那種先點先贏的方式比較沒話說，不然就會造成晚來的人反而有歌唱(因為在不同桌)然後早早點歌的人乾等，以上參考。","At 10 o'clock in the evening, I ca n’t sing at 4 am.
