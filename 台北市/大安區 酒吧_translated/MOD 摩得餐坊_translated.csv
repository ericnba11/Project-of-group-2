"被譽為酒界少林寺，我個人相當認同
認同在於，這裡不論是純飲、經典、特調都有非常優的水準，水準既高又平均；甚至連食物也都讓人滿意，就像少林寺系統化訓練出大量優異武僧一樣，比喻到位

這裡調酒的路線是，每一款都非常順口，層次豐富，但酒精度依舊感受得到，但不是讓人覺得新奇的味道
走得比較不是創意，而是技術的展現

相對來說食物反而有一點創意，食物我個人最喜歡皮蛋臭豆腐包生菜
雖然設計來搭配生菜，但實際單吃也很美味，不會過鹹，口味是溫順但不失風味
炒飯是我第二偏好的，油香味炒得非常足，帶有甜香的鍋氣
水餃很限量，每天只準備兩份
但坦白說如果水餃的餡料口感再紮實一點會更讓我喜歡，目前的餡料入口是偏軟的
炸豬肉是第三名，這種古早味的炸法保有香度與肉汁，非常迷人
薯條、滷味也都很不錯，這裡的炸物不是用隨便的冷凍炸物下去加熱的
炸醬麵也相當有水準，可是炒飯真的太傑出，澱粉主食的排名我會是炒飯 > 炸醬麵 > 水餃","Known as the wine industry Shaolin Temple, I personally agree
Recognition is, in obscure Naguy Drink, Classic, Specialty have very special standards, high quality is high and average; even the food is satisfied, like Shaolin Temple systemization training out a large number of excellent martial monks, metaphors in place

The route of brewing is savored, each one is very smooth and rich in layers, but the alcohol can still feel the alcohol, but the unresistance makes people feel novel taste
Going more unresistant creativity, and the tweeting technology is displayed

Relative to food, there is a little creativity, food I personally like the skin egg stinky tofu bun lettuce
Although the design is paired with lettuce, the actual order is also very delicious, not overly salty, the taste is smooth but not featuring
Fried rice dried my second preference, oily fragrance fried very plentiful, with a sweet fragrance pot
The dumplings are limited and only prepare two copies per day
But frankly said if the dumplings of dumplings are more solid will make me like it, the current dumplings are weak
The third place in fried pork is fried, and the fried taste of ancient frying is very charming
French fries, stewed flavors are also very good, the fried foods are unfriched unfrishing to heat down with casual refrigeration fried
Fried noodles are also quite standard, can be too outstanding of fried rice, starch staple ranking I will be fried rice > fried noodles > dumplings",False
"來訪無數次

"已經忘記是否曾幾何時到訪過，但走進店裡，一種60、70年代的old school感，二進的門廊，加上鵝黃燈光、單條原木bar、高椅，英倫風格的lounge bar感，加上雪茄菸燻的環境氣味，老派溫馨感十足。

隱身在仁愛路的小巷內，接近忠孝敦化站，招牌很不顯眼，但到訪會有老饕感。酒單價位比起一線大路酒吧顯的平實，可以算是威士忌專業的酒吧，各產地的威士忌幾乎都有，ob酒廠的經典也算齊全，選酒也都是產區經典或特色酒，價位250-400不等，以平價經典為主，但也是有相對高價位的年份酒或ib酒，其實可以滿足大多數威克普飲需求。

調酒的部分比較推薦經典，中規中矩水準之上；特色調酒就相對略顯普通，以現在多元色香味的酒吧爭鳴，特調就友達以上戀人未滿，可以encore，但不到bravo，可以搭配偶有嘗試，不過酒類眾多，可以挑選調整。

然後餐點無庸置疑水準之上，下酒小菜很不錯，可能開店也夠久1995年以來經過多年淬鍊風雨，特色吃食很多饕客推薦，可以參考其他人推薦的各式餐點，基本上無雷，很多人推薦教官滷味、鹹豬肉、生菜皮蛋臭豆腐、水餃、生蠔等等，店裡的辣醬也是相當香麻值得一試。如果一一評論可以再寫一篇，反正暫時沒有踩到雷，可以放心試試。","I have forgotten whether I visited in a time, but when I walked into the store, a sense of OLD SCHOOL in the 1960s and 1970s, the two -entry porch, plus goose yellow light, single log BAR, high chair, British -style Lounge Bar, plus plus The smoky environment of the cigar is full of warmth.

There are almost all whiskey in various production areas. The classics of OB winery are also complete. -400 is the main, mainly cheap classics, but also a relatively high -priced year wine or IB wine, which can actually meet most Weikop's drinking needs.

The part of the bartender is more recommended for classics, which is quite satisfactory; the characteristic bartending is relatively ordinary. Based on the current bars with a multi -color fragrance, the lover of AUO or above is not full. There are tries with puppets, but there are many alcohols and can be selected and adjusted.

Then there is no doubt that the meal is not doubtful. The side dishes are very good. It may be enough to open a store for a long time since 1995. Thunder, many people recommend the instructors, salted pork, salted pork, lettuce eggs stinky tofu, dumplings, oysters, etc. The hot sauce in the store is also quite fragrant and worth trying.If you can write another article one by one, you can try it with confidence anyway, you can try it at ease.",False

週六晚上去消費，一為年紀很大的阿姨帶位加點酒，但過程中口氣超傲慢，問關於酒的問題卻被回　＂啊　這都不知道喔，對啊　本來就這樣啊，蛤　蛤＂，一度已為是從夜店找打掃的阿姨來兼職，結果點的酒價位高且味道也超淡，總結ＣＰ質低＋服務態度惡劣,"Go to spend on Saturday night, and add some wine to the old aunt, but in the process, he is super arrogant, but the question about wine is returned.

雖然Gin Tonic可能是有很多Gin可以選，來客如果沒有特指也是不需要非要問到底到底要什麼Gin酒。這家服務員嬸嬸就還蠻愛較真。不過也說明在這家喝酒可能需要被她挑戰酒品知識，請做好準備再去咯。,"Although GIN TONIC may have many GINs to choose, guests do not need to ask what GIN wine is needed if they do not refer to.This waiter is quite true.However, it also shows that drinking in this house may need to be challenged by her wine.

據說是很多人喝酒的起點。

經典一夜。","[Drink in Taipei: Mod Public Bar]

It is said that it is the starting point for many people to drink.

Classic one night.",False
"環境和氛圍幾乎相同。  不起眼的入口在小巷子裡。  一進門就能聞到雪茄和煙霧的味道。 （深夜允許吸煙）。  旁邊的長酒吧提供來自世界各地的精選威士忌。

十年前，這裡曾經是我每週都會去的地方。  自從我搬回自己的國家以來，已經很久沒有去過了。  老闆、經理、調酒師都換了。  菜單相對保持不變。  酒吧並不像我記憶中那麼繁忙。  雖然工作人員仍然很友好，但他們不太有吸引力。

我通常從老式開始，但這次，我不得不說有點令人失望。  確實沒什麼特別的。  只是普通的老式，在那裡你可以品嚐配料，但感覺不像是爆裂的。

食物還是很棒的！  臭豆腐真是好吃極了。  10年過去了，味道還是記憶中的樣子。  如果你去過那裡，一定要嘗試。  不要被標題嚇到。","The environment and atmosphere are almost the same.The inconspicuous entrance is in the alley.As soon as you enter the door, you can smell the smell of cigar and smoke.(Smoking at night).The long bar next to it offers selected whiskey from all over the world.

Ten years ago, here was where I would go every week.Since I moved back to my country, I haven't been there for a long time.The boss, manager, and bartender have changed.The menu is relatively unchanged.The bar is not as busy as in my memory.Although the staff is still very friendly, they are not very attractive.

I usually start from the old style, but this time, I have to say that it is a bit disappointing.There is really nothing special.It's just an ordinary old style. You can taste the ingredients there, but it doesn't feel like a burst.

The food is still great!Stinky tofu is really delicious.Ten years have passed, and the taste is still what is in memory.If you have been there, you must try it.Don't be scared by the title.",False
你每週都可以在這裡找到我一次。這就是我的評價！很棒的雞尾酒！也一定要嚐嚐他們的食物，臭豆腐是低調的五星級。,"You can find me here every week.This is my evaluation!A great cocktail!It must also taste their food, stinky tofu is a low -key five -star.",False
"隱藏在小巷裡的很酷的小地方。最低收費為 500 台幣。

飲料很美味，服務也很棒。我和幾個朋友坐在酒吧里，所以調酒師很細心。要了一些用茶做的客製化飲料，太好了！

主要缺點是吸煙，但我發現台灣許多酒吧/俱樂部普遍接受吸煙。","Hidden in a cool small place in the alley.The minimum fee is 500 Taiwan dollars.

The drink is delicious and the service is great.A few friends and I sat in the bar, so the bartender was very careful.I asked some customized drinks made of tea, so good!

"很酷、友善的酒吧。
調酒師很友善，也很幽默。他們都會說英語，輕度溝通幾乎沒有問題。
雞尾酒的味道比韓國的要濃一點，但對我來說還是不錯的。","Cool, friendly bar.

飲料的選擇很豐富，他們的食物也出奇的好。他們以臭豆腐而聞名，我認為這是必須嘗試的。,"The choice of drinks is very rich, and their food is surprisingly good.They are famous for stinky tofu, and I think this must be tried.",False
酒吧從外面看起來很豪華，但裡面卻很陳舊。你可以在這裡吃飯，但你可以在整個區域吸煙，所以如果你不吸煙那就很糟糕了。飲料還不錯，但沒什麼特別的，在台北同樣的價格肯定能找到更好的酒吧...,"The bar looks luxurious from the outside, but inside is very old.You can eat here, but you can smoke in the entire area, so it will be bad if you don't smoke.The drink is not bad, but there is nothing special.

我在台北最喜歡的酒吧之一。來過好幾次了，還是很喜歡這個地方。飲料、食物、音樂和氛圍，一切都很好！,"I am one of the favorite bars in Taipei.I have been here several times, I still like this place very much.Drinks, food, music and atmosphere, everything is good!",False
當我搬到 Tpe 時，我最先認識的酒吧之一。還是很喜歡這個地方！我來這裡主要是為了這裡的氛圍。經典的威士忌酒吧，舒適樸實。晚上 9 點左右就會變得很煙燻。飲料很好，但不是從菜單上點菜的最佳地點。我總是點牡蠣，有點貴（ard 500+nt），但嘗試很有趣😍😍 …,"When I moved to TPE, one of the bars I knew first.I still like this place very much!I came here mainly for the atmosphere here.Classic whiskey bar, comfortable and simple.It will become very smoky about 9 pm.The drink is good, but it is not the best place to order from the menu.I always order oysters, a bit expensive (ARD 500+NT), but the attempt is very interesting ...",False
本來可以是一個不錯的地方，但他們糟糕的服務毀了整個晚上。他們告訴我有生啤酒吉尼斯黑啤酒，但沒有告訴我，就以250元台幣的價格給我瓶裝吉尼斯黑啤酒。然後他們說他們沒有吉尼斯啤酒。然後繼續給我倒一小杯現成的其他飲料。難以置信。,"It could have been a good place, but their bad service ruined the whole night.They told me that there was a beer of Guinness Black Beer, but did not tell me that I bumped in Guinness Black Beer at a price of RMB 250.Then they said they did not have Guinness beer.Then continue to pour me a small cup of ready -made drinks.incredible.",False
優雅的小地方，座位有限。雪茄煙霧繚繞，因為它們允許在室內吸煙。種類豐富的蘇格蘭威士忌菜單和涼爽的圓形冰塊是來這裡的一個很好的理由，但我們在這裡呆了兩個多小時，而且由於服務太慢，我們很難花費超過每人500 美元的最低付款額。留下了雪茄的臭味，對這個地方很不滿意。,"Elegant small places, limited seats.Cigar smoke is dazzling because they allow smoking indoors.The variety of Scottish whiskey menus and cool round ice cubes are a good reason to come here, but we stayed here for more than two hours, and because the service was too slow, it would be difficult for us to spend more than $ 500 per person per person.

MOD 公共酒吧，我深愛的台北世外桃源超過 15 年了！它位於城市小巷中，是單一麥芽威士忌愛好者的天堂，由熟練的調酒師和令人垂涎的酒吧食品提供服務。工作人員精心策劃的音樂為舒適的環境增添了無與倫比的氛圍。一顆永恆的寶石，讓我不斷回來尋找更多。 🥃,"MOD Public Bar, I have loved Taipei Xanadu for more than 15 years!It is located in urban alleys and is a paradise for a single malt whiskey enthusiast.

這個地方很好，很暗，但大多數酒吧都是。酒度不錯，雞尾酒調製的也很快，但最低收費500元台幣，所以至少要點2杯飲料，不太方便。聲音不太大，即使這個地方幾乎滿了，我們仍然可以毫無問題地聊天。,"This place is very good, very dark, but most of the bars are.The wine is good, and the cocktails are also very fast, but the minimum fee is 500 yuan, so at least 2 cups of drinks are not convenient.The sound is not too loud, even if this place is almost full, we can still chat without any problems.",False

"休閒酒吧提供優質飲品，不僅僅是典型的酒吧食品。我很喜歡他們的皮蛋臭豆腐——搭配一碗米飯或附帶的生菜杯非常完美。主要缺點是晚上 9 點後允許吸煙。

我在台北最喜歡的酒吧之一。這是一個小巷子裡的小地方，沒有明顯的標誌。我通常會喝第二代長島冰茶。他們把威士忌放在那裡，非常棒。威士忌酸味也不錯。然而，這是一個人們在室內吸煙的地方。做好準備吧！,"I am one of the favorite bars in Taipei.This is a small place in the alley, without obvious signs.I usually drink the second -generation Long Island ice tea.They put the whiskey there very well.The taste of whiskey is also good.However, this is a place where people smoke indoors.Be ready!",False
在開放時間左右來到這裡，並在人群到達之前離開。 MOD 的氛圍昏暗、舒適、友善。他們提供多種烈酒和雞尾酒（不能多說後者，因為我們沒有很多），而且這裡的食物品質非常高。,"Come here around the opening time and leave before the crowd arrives.The atmosphere of MOD is dim, comfortable, and friendly.They offer a variety of spirits and cocktails (ca n’t say more about the latter, because we do not have a lot), and the food quality here is very high.",False
煙霧瀰漫 價格太高 這個酒吧煙霧繚繞，不友好，而且過時...如果你是調酒師的朋友或漂亮女孩，那麼你會讓你坐在吧台...否則他們可能會被推到角落. ..服務不專業而且相當不友好...他們甚至在忙著和女孩聊天時都不為你服務...我認為他們不熱衷於自己的業務...只有他們自己的遊樂場...,"The smoke is too high, the bar is lingering, unreasonable, and outdated ... If you are a friend or beautiful girl of the bartender, then you will let you sit on the bar ... otherwise they may be pushed to the corner. .. The service is unprofessional and quite unfriendly ... They don't even serve you when they are busy chatting with girls ... I don't think they are keen on their business ... Only their own playground ...",False
食物和飲料都不錯。氣氛很糟。最突出的是糟糕的服務。這是我第二次來這裡。服務生不專心，等了20分鐘才拿到一杯飲料。似乎也沒有人關心。作為一名酒吧老闆和調酒師，我看到了潛力，但沒人關心。遺憾。我不會第三次回來。,"Food and drinks are good.The atmosphere is bad.The most prominent is the bad service.This is my second time here.The waiter did not concentrate and waited for 20 minutes to get a drink.No one seems to care.As a bar owner and bartender, I saw the potential, but no one cared.Pity.I won't come back for the third time.",False

唯一的問題，而且是一個大問題，是他們允許在室內吸煙。如果不是因為室內吸煙，這將是我去的酒吧。","This place is hidden in a small alley without any labels or lights (except for inconspicuous circular signs). This place is really hidden for passers -by.Although their drinks are expensive (average of NT $ 300), they have a strong taste and they are very good.I strongly recommend their old -fashioned Mogo and/or additional strength.In addition, if you afford it, their snacks are also good (250NT+).

不是最容易有意找到的，但肯定是一顆寶石。昏暗的燈光營造出涼爽而親密的氛圍。酒吧後面還有各種各樣的威士忌。,"It's not the easiest to find, but it must be a gem.The dim light creates a cool and intimate atmosphere.There are all kinds of whiskey behind the bar.",False
