"環境很棒的一家品酒加賣酒的日本酒專賣直營店，裡面有一些獨特款的酒，以清酒和燒酎為主。

難得有機會能參與品酒會，認識到日本酒不同的風味與文化；與日本酒手工製作相同背景的手工藝術品也是帶來不同文化體驗！,"It is rare to have the opportunity to participate in the wine tasting party and recognize the different flavors and culture of Japanese wine; hand -made artworks with the same background as Japanese wine, also bring different cultural experiences!",False
"評分：9/10

心得：
先從環境開始，有分酒區跟吧台座位區，走日系木造感舒適整潔，雖然沒有bar的感覺但很像來到買房的接待中心（稱讚意味），可以在理性之餘小酌不易失手傷荷包
試喝的部分，清酒確實不容易試喝，風味銳減太快，能試喝的品項偏少（去酒展可以喝爆），但3杯試喝的套組真的很適合想多嘗試的人（例如我😂），試喝三款清酒/三款梅酒，雖說有上有下，但整體感覺很好，介紹與配酒小點，讓品飲體驗更完整。
最後是人員與服務，很有耐心介紹很完整，可以提很多需求與提問，找到最適合自己的，尤其推薦5折專區，雖然過季，但勝在cp值很高，買就對了！","Rating: 9/10
Amount: 3795?(2 Set+4 wines are too scratched)
Experience:
Starting from the environment, there is a bartender area and bar seat area, and the Japanese style wooden feel is comfortable and neat. Although there is no BAR feeling, it is very similar to the reception center (praise) to buy a house. Pocket
For the trial part, sake is really not easy to try, the flavor is sharp and fast, and the items that can be tried to drink are small (you can drink explosion), but the 3 cup of trial sets are really suitable for trying more People (such as me), try to drink three sake/three plum wine. Although there are upper and lower, the overall feel is very good.

初來乍到，被電視節目燒到，於是上了YOUTUBE看完完整影片，介紹內容大概有清酒、紅酒等，加上我自已本身有在品酒，決定要去友士之酒亭看看。友士之酒亭主要以日本文化、清酒、燒酎、梅酒為主，不時有活動舉辦，像是錯過的調合威士忌課程，像是錯過的十勝清酒組合等，這次清酒組合是以友士代理的清酒le lac，以及小點心
le lac純米吟釀 無過濾生原酒 美山錦
酒體輕盈，淡淡果香，尾韻短，體驗不出來美山錦想表達的意境，搭配備前燒使用，更輕盈更無感，搭配純錫，更冷咧更有甜感
le lac純米吟釀 無過濾生原酒 人心地
生原酒的部份，比較接近釀酒人想呈現的酒感、香氣、氣味，人心地的米種沒聽過，整體而言酸甜感都滿平衡的
le lac純米吟釀 無過濾生原酒 秋田酒小町
比較滑順口感，也比較有酒氣，搭配備前燒使用，少了酒氣，呈現出的酸甜感更為明顯，搭配純錫，更利口一些
今天服務員是總公司派來代班的，人很親切，那對於商品的部份解說也滿正確的，可能是因為每個人接受的酒都很直觀，以及個人化…，於是後續加點單杯的聚樂太閤 純米吟釀
聚樂太閤 純米吟釀，米種是我最愛的山田錦，山田錦瓜果香氣足，入口乳酸、香甜感凸出，聚樂太閤 純米吟釀這支尾韻高雅且長，不適合使用備前燒，純錫器讓酒體更紮實
和服務人員聊聊，知道我常喝威士忌，又介紹了幾款威士忌，以及前之課程留下來的長濱原酒試飲，山櫻的表現真的非常好，前味花香，中味梅子麥香、尾韻草本味悠長；長濱5年比8年好喝，除了香氣、酒體飽滿，以及尾韻悠長，還包含了複雜性，非常有特色

專營日本酒和燒酒的商店。商品種類繁多，光是看著就很有趣。工作人員也很友善，如果你告訴他們你的喜好，他們會給你各種建議。店內還設有酒吧空間，您可以在這裡享用便餐和各種酒精飲料。它關門較早，因此您可能無法及時參加餘興派對。我們建議享用輕便的晚餐並在晚上 8 點前抵達。,"Specializing in Japanese wine and shochu shops.There are many types of products, and it is very interesting to look at it.The staff is also very friendly. If you tell them your preferences, they will give you various suggestions.There is also a bar space in the store, you can enjoy a laxative and various alcoholic beverages here.It was closed earlier, so you may not be able to attend the Yu Xing party in time.We recommend enjoying light dinner and arrival before 8 pm.",False

我很幸運地遇到了日本員工，他們教了我很多關於商店的概念，他們攜帶的酒精飲料等等🙇
我收到了福州（兵庫縣）的品酒比較，狀態很好，他們很細心地享用不同的清酒杯，還有小零食，所以我可以享受一頓醉酒後的餐後清酒。
燒酒的陣容也令人驚嘆，我希望看到它作為日本酒（清酒、燒酒）的旗艦店而聞名！我支持你！ …","June 2, 2024
I am fortunate to meet Japanese employees. They taught me a lot about the concept of the store, the alcoholic beverages they carried, etc.
I received the comparison of wine tasting in Fuzhou (Hyogo County). They were in good condition. They enjoyed different sake glasses and small snacks, so I could enjoy a meal after a meal after a meal.
The shochu lineup is also amazing. I hope to see it known as the flagship store of Japanese wine (sake, shochu)!I support you!Mowing",False
位於雙連站附近的酒舖。我對一個熱愛日本文化的國家的清酒價格和清單感到好奇，所以我尋找清酒商店並參觀了這個地方，因為它適合我的路線。清酒陣容比韓國弱，價格範圍也相差不大。除了清酒之外，我們還提供燒酒利口酒、日本威士忌和梅酒。店裡還可以品酒，而且品酒的價格也很合理，三杯12000韓元左右，而且他們提供的清酒也相當好喝。會說英語的工作人員非常友好，最棒的是你可以免費品嚐一些燒酒和威士忌產品。事實上，我更喜歡免費的燒酒和威士忌，而不是清酒。,"The wine shop located near Shuanglian Station.I am curious about the price and list of sake and list of a country that loves Japanese culture, so I looked for a winery shop and visited this place because it is suitable for my route.The sake lineup is weaker than South Korea, and the price range is not much different.In addition to sake, we also provide shochu liquor, Japanese whiskey and plum wine.The store can also be tasting, and the price of wine tasting is also very reasonable. It is about 12,000 won in three cups, and the sake they provide is quite delicious.The staff who speak English is very friendly. The best thing is that you can taste some shochu and whiskey products for free.In fact, I prefer free shochu and whiskey, not sake.",False
