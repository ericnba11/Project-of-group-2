"偶然發現的花博園區酒吧，原本是要去另一間Triangle，但踏入之後發現這邊別有洞天，一群酒吧餐酒館，室內戶外都有，各異其趣。

外籍人士超多，各色人種，白人黑人南亞人穆斯林，應有盡有。

我們去的是 23 Music Room , 這邊很文青 , so hippie or hipster 🌵👍🌵👍
現場有DJ放歌，客人都很愉快，跳舞聽歌或聊天。

三個年輕店員：Caleb 美國德州小帥哥、Winnie 外文系學生、小雲美人兒，超客氣超友善。自製精釀生啤酒也超新鮮。大家好愉快。這邊實在是好地方，好chill, 好有出國的感覺🌵🌵

我大推呀！☺️☺️🌈🌈

外國旅客非常多，氣氛熱鬧，喜歡精釀啤酒可以去！,"There are a lot of foreign travelers, and the atmosphere is lively. You can go!"
週年派對時去跳舞掉了一顆戒指，留了電話給仙女店員，結果真的找回來了🥺難以答謝這件最讚的店，我愛你們！,"During the anniversary party, I danced a ring and left a phone call to the fairy clerk. As a result, I really found it. It is difficult to thank this most well -known shop. I love you!"
"Debby很親切
整個店的氛圍感超舒適
當天居然還有動漫音樂趴！
下次一定會再來~","Debby is very kind
The atmosphere of the entire store is super comfortable
There was an anime music party that day!
I will come again next time ~"
店員十分健談，感覺得出來對於台灣精釀啤酒文化十分有想法的一間店，酒類口味很多，也不吝嗇讓人試喝看看，最後再選擇自己喜歡的味道，音樂風格也很不錯。,"The clerk is very talkative and feels that it is a shop that is very thoughtful for Taiwan's craft beer culture. There are many wine tastes, and you do n’t hesitate to try to drink. Finally, you choose your favorite taste. The music style is also very good."
"店里感覺很輕鬆，店經理很活躍，讓人感覺很舒適，不會有很商業的酒吧感覺，像是在走朋友的店一樣，跟每個客人都能輕鬆舒適的聊天。
店里都是他們自家酒廠的精釀，口味上很平易近人。
也有提供調酒跟紅白酒，開放空間很大，是值得放入口袋名單的一間。","The store feels very easy. The store manager is very active and makes people feel very comfortable. There will not be a very commercial bar feeling. Like a friend's shop, you can chat easily and comfortably with every guest.
The shops are all of their own wineries, and their tastes are very approachable.
There are also bartending and red and white wine. There is a lot of open space, which is worth putting on the pocket list."
半開放的空間很加分，這間店不會有密閉空間的不適感。音樂聲音大小剛好，不會讓人耳朵不舒服。人開始多後店員會主動調低冷氣，整體環境維持得相當不錯👍 …,"The semi -open space is very bonus, and this store will not have a sense of discomfort.The sound of the music sound is just right, and it will not make people feel uncomfortable.After more people start, the shop staff will take the initiative to lower the air -conditioning, and the overall environment is maintained very well ..."
"氣氛很棒 音樂好聽
Happy hours啤酒特價真的很划算
在點酒之前 店員姊姊很親切地讓我們試喝 挑選順口的精釀啤酒

Before ordering wine, the clerk and sister asked us to try to choose a smooth craft beer

二訪，喜歡音樂，酒種滿多，空間舒適，HappyHour滿超值，Pizza尚可。,"Second visit, like music, full of wine, comfortable space, happyhour full value, Pizza is still acceptable."
"Happy Hour 啤酒只要150
店內音樂也很讚，店長人很好聊～","Happy Hour Beer only costs 150
The music in the store is also very good, the store manager is very good to talk ~"
每週都會換啤酒 店員很親切 有時候會有表演 座位區偏少 外面有吸煙區 花博裡外也都有廁所 很方便,"The beer shop staff is very kind every week. Sometimes, there are fewer performance seats. There are toilets and toilets."
每個月 第一個禮拜天 下午3點到6點 有阿根廷探戈舞會,"On the first week of every month, there will be Argentina Tango Dance Club from 3 pm to 6 pm"
"3/23
致：11:00-12:00的DJ，希望可以放鐵","3/23
To: 11: 00-12: 00 DJ, I hope to put iron"
2020新年快樂！今天1/1有營業喔~讚,Happy New Year 2020!There is business today 1/1 ~ Like
"原來花博晚上有這麼一個Bar
有音樂有跳舞有點High
蠻多外國人的
啤酒.調酒種類都蠻多的","It turns out that Huabo has such a bar at night
There are music and dancing, a bit high
There are many foreigners
Beer. There are quite a lot of bartending types"
"每週更換的特色啤酒🍻Funny , 現場音樂太小 聲，冷氣不夠強","The special beer 🍻funny is replaced every week, the live music is too low, and the air -conditioning is not strong enough"
音樂越來越大聲 直接把客人清場 寫了music結果搞得比夜店還大聲 喝酒會喝到頭在痛,The music became more and more loud and directly wrote the results of the guest clearance. The result of Music was more painful than drinking loudly than the nightclub.
美女調酒師～可愛又好聊天,Beauty bartender ~ cute and good chat
"愛店之一。
最實在真誠的小酒吧。
物美價廉，氣氛音樂店員都超讚。","One of the love shops.
The most sincere bar.
Masterpiece is cheap, and the atmosphere music clerk is superb."
酒類很多種,There are many kinds of wine
老闆人很好~~很推的酒吧 而且happy hour很多酒類只要100,The boss is very good ~~ The bar that is very pushed and the HAPPY HOUR many wines only need 100 alcoholics
喜歡店內輕鬆的感覺,Like the relaxed feeling in the store
啤酒不錯，音樂跟氣氛也很好,"Beer is good, music and atmosphere are also very good"
態度差 酒難喝 對表演者不尊重,"Poor attitude is hard to drink, not respect for performers"
音樂很棒，但不適合聊天,"The music is great, but it is not suitable for chat"
覺得是基本酒款 酒保很正,I think the basic wine is very positive
"愛這個地方、愛techno
愛這邊的bartender、愛這邊的pizza","Love this place, love Techno
Love here, Bartender, Pizza on Love here"

精釀啤酒好喝！,Cast beer is delicious!
喝精釀的好地方,Good place to drink craftsmanship
"他們自己釀啤酒！讓我告訴你，淡色艾爾啤酒非常棒！

我問調酒師「有台灣當地的精釀啤酒嗎」。她說「是的，我們的啤酒」。我說「哪個啤酒廠」？她說“我們的啤酒廠，我們自己釀造啤酒，今年是我們成立10週年”

友善熱情的調酒師，營造出輕鬆的搖滾氛圍。我感覺就像在家一樣。我喜歡這個地方！ ！ （不要讓我的塑膠杯阻止你，我要了一個塑膠杯，因為我想把最後一杯啤酒帶走 - 是的，他們讓你這樣做）","They brew beer by themselves!Let me tell you, light -colored El Beer is great!

I asked the winemaker, ""Is there a local craft beer in Taiwan?""She said, ""Yes, our beer.""I say ""Which beer""?She said, ""Our beer plant, we brew beer by ourselves, this year is the 10th anniversary of our establishment""

The friendly and enthusiastic bartender creates a relaxed rock atmosphere.I feel like at home.I like this place!Intersection(Don't let my plastic cup stop you, I want a plastic cup, because I want to take the last cup of beer away -yes, they let you do this)"
"我在馬吉廣場時最常去的地方是 23。

台北有兩家分店，一間在圓山，另一間在科技大廈附近。這兩個地方都提供高品質的台灣精釀啤酒。

不過，圓山的23音樂室對我來說更有趣，因為他們經常有DJ，根據夜晚和活動播放不同類型的音樂。因此，如果您想享受樂趣或隨著音樂移動身體。就是這個地方！

那裡的工作人員也很友好，英語說得很好，可以推薦各種啤酒。

他們沒有太多食物，只有披薩和薯條。所以，如果你餓了，最好先去外面吃，但他們的披薩很便宜而且還不錯。

我喜歡這個地方！ 🍻","The most common place I went to Maggie Square was 23.

There are two branches in Taipei, one is in Yuanshan and the other is near the Science and Technology Building.Both places provide high -quality Taiwanese craft beer.

However, the 23 -music room of Yuanshan is more interesting to me because they often have DJs and play different types of music according to nights and activities.So if you want to enjoy fun or move your body with the music.This is the place!

The staff there are also very friendly, English is very good, and you can recommend all kinds of beer.

They don't have much food, only pizza and fries.So, if you are hungry, it is best to go outside first, but their pizza is cheap and pretty good.

I like this place!Bleak"
"很棒的聚會酒吧🥳🥳🥳

如果想隨意聊天，周圍有有趣的人，氣氛舒適。啤酒的選擇相當不錯，從異國情調的 IPA 到適合啤酒愛好者的奶油黑啤酒。那裡的音樂值得期待，所以不要錯過台北美藝術館附近的這個地方。 …","Great party bar

If you want to chat at will, there are interesting people around, and the atmosphere is comfortable.The choice of beer is pretty good, from the exotic IPA to the cream black beer suitable for beer enthusiasts.The music there is worth looking forward to, so don't miss the place near the Taipei American Art Museum.Mowing"
很酷的酒吧，有好東西和好音樂。在某些週末晚上，他們會演奏電子音樂！驚人的！當地的精釀啤酒是一大優勢！瑟爾瑟爾腸！,"Cool bar, good things and good music.On some weekend and evening, they will perform electronic music!Amazing!Local craft beer is a major advantage!Surr's intestine!"
"我去過那裡好幾次了，時好時壞，有時氣氛很好，有時可能會因為糟糕的音樂而受到質疑。
那個地方可能會出人意料地空蕩蕩，出乎你的意料。

沒關係，您只需親自查看該地點並決定是否要在此處過夜即可。","I have been there several times there, it is good and bad, sometimes the atmosphere is good, and sometimes it may be questioned because of bad music.
That place may be unexpectedly empty and unexpected.

It doesn't matter, you just need to check the location and decide whether to spend the night here."
音樂室 23 很有氛圍。啤酒很好。裝飾是隨興的、簡約的、地下的，但不知何故感覺不錯。音樂主要是電子音樂，而且總是有一些不錯的現場 DJ 表演。有些夜晚，根據主題的不同，確實是史詩般的。也期待一些更安靜的夜晚。,"The music room 23 is very atmospheric.Beer is very good.The decoration is easy -going, simple, and underground, but somehow feels good.The music is mainly electronic music, and there are always some good live DJ performances.Some nights are indeed epic depending on the theme.I also look forward to some quieter nights."
所以，你可能對手工酒吧沒有什麼期望，但他們使用的披薩非常棒。雙份ipa也很好吃。調酒師很努力。,"Therefore, you may not have much expectations for the handmade bar, but the pizza they use is great.Double IPA is also delicious.The bartender worked very hard."
我喜歡週日下午和女朋友在這裡騎自行車，享受音樂和 IPA。很棒的啤酒和與朋友一起參觀的好地方。週日不太忙，這使得它非常適合品嚐一些最喜歡的食物以及美食廣場的小吃或晚餐或裡面提供的任何東西，第一個和第三個週日會有一位出色的 DJ Andrew 在這裡。,"I like to ride a bicycle here with my girlfriend on Sunday afternoon and enjoy music and IPA.A great place for beer to visit with friends.Sunday is not too busy, which makes it very suitable for taste some favorite foods and snacks or dinner or anything provided in food squares. The first and third Sunday will have an excellent DJ Andrew here."
好地方，有美味的啤酒和音樂！,"Good place, delicious beer and music!"
好啤酒和好DJ。,Good beer and good DJ.
美好的地方！台北最好的啤酒和DJ音樂！,Beautiful place!The best beer and DJ music in Taipei!
"不尊重任何表演者，老闆也沒有接受過語言方面的教育，因此他對使用歧視性詞語沒有任何感覺，例如日語中的“JAP”。
如果你是黑膠唱片 DJ，你必須小心他的報價，尤其是如果你來自海外。首先，這裡的轉盤完全不行，這裡的工作人員對音響也不懂，但是他們包括業主都認為還可以。在打 DJ 之前，我試圖確保他們的音頻一切正常，但我發現地線壞了，我問工作人員這些轉盤是怎麼回事，但他只回答我「我不知道」。我也問過店主，他只說不會有音頻。就這樣。不過這對我來說是非常難以置信的，他認為在這麼糟糕的條件下請黑膠唱片 DJ 在那裡演奏也沒什麼問題。正如我所猜測的，由於接地線破損，打 DJ 時一直有很多噪音。另外，他們所有的 DJ 設備都沾滿了灰塵，所以無論您是黑膠唱片 DJ 還是 CDJ，都很難指望這裡有好的聲音。
更重要的是，如果你不是那麼有名的 DJ，也不太謙虛地要求付款，那麼店主就會認為他不需要為你付錢。他仍然只是說我收到他的報價時沒有問他付款，他認為這個邏輯很好，如果表演者在演出前沒有問他，那麼商店也不需要付款。我們從來沒有談論過報酬，當然他也從來沒有和他談論過這個問題，儘管我仍然認為他們需要為所有表演者支付一些費用，除非表演者說不付款也可以（好吧，我確信我已經這次從來沒有這麼說過）。即使是小額的付款也沒關係，因為這表明了他們對演出的感受，而且我不會為此向他們索取非常昂貴的價格。我知道我不是世界上著名的 DJ，所以我知道我該如何表現。所以我不能接受的是他的行為和想法對所有藝術家的不尊重，這只會讓我非常失望。最後，他仍然說他不明白自己的問題是什麼。至少，你得醒來看看你在你的FB上叫我為「JAP」做廣告。希望他能努力學習更多，即使只是關於語言。
這裡根本不推薦未來所有的表演者。如果你認為他們給了你經驗，那完全是謊言。他們只利用你。他們給你作為成長中的職業 DJ 的經驗，所以他們需要給你報酬，即使是很少的，因為你獲得了作為「專業表演者」的經驗。
感謝您閱讀冗長無聊的評論，希望這對您有所幫助並保護 DJ 的驕傲。","Without respect for any performers, the boss has not received language education, so he has no feeling for using discriminatory words, such as ""JAP"" in Japanese.
If you are a vinyl record DJ, you must be careful of his offer, especially if you are from overseas.First of all, the turntable here is completely unsuccessful, and the staff here do not understand the sound, but they believe that the owners think it is OK.Before playing DJ, I tried to ensure that everything was normal for their audio, but I found that the ground line was broken. I asked the staff what was going on, but he only answered me ""I don't know.""I also asked the owner, he only said that there would be no audio.that's all.However, this is very incredible for me. He believes that it is no problem to ask the vinyl record DJ to play there under such bad conditions.As I guess, due to the damage to the ground wire, there have been many noise when playing DJ.In addition, all their DJ devices are covered with dust, so whether you are vinyl record DJ or CDJ, it is difficult to expect a good voice here.
More importantly, if you are not so famous DJs and do not ask for payment modestly, then the owner will think he does not need to pay for you.He still just said that when I received his quotation, he didn't ask him to pay. He thought the logic was good. If the performer did not ask him before the performance, the store did not need to pay.We have never talked about compensation, and of course he has never talked about this problem with him, although I still think that they need to pay some performers, unless the performer says that it is not paid (well, I am sure I am already here I have never said that).Even small payments are okay, because it shows their feelings about the performance, and I will not ask them for a very expensive price for this.I know I am not the famous DJ in the world, so I know how I should perform.So what I can't accept is that his behavior and ideas are disrespectful to all artists, which will only disappoint me.In the end, he still said he didn't understand what his problem was.At least, you have to wake up and take a look at you call me ""JAP"" on your FB.I hope he can work hard to learn more, even if it is only about language.
It is not recommended here all the performers in the future.If you think they have given you experience, it is a lie.They only use you.They give you the experience of DJs in growth, so they need to pay you, even if they are very small, because you have gained an experience as a ""professional performer"".
Thank you for reading a long and boring comment. I hope this will help you and protect DJ."
他們店裡的轉盤壞了。而這家音樂酒吧的工作人員甚至沒有任何音響系統知識。否則，如果你不要求，DJ 就不會付錢，他們認為這種態度沒有問題。此外，他們在 Facebook 廣告上稱日本人為“Jap”，這對一個國家來說是非常粗魯的行為。,"The turntable in their shop was broken.The staff of this music bar does not even have any audio system knowledge.Otherwise, if you do not ask, DJ will not pay, and they think that this attitude is no problem.In addition, they call the Japanese ""JAP"" in Facebook ads, which is very rude for a country."
你知道…完美的定義經常提到這個夢幻般的酒店的大多數評論者。酒精？查看。各種音樂？無盡的。我在這裡結識了一些終生的朋友。如何？你應該親自去了解一下。,You know ... Perfect definition often refers to most commentators in this dreamy hotel.Alcohol?Check.Various music?Endless.I met some lifelong friends here.how?You should learn it yourself.
在這裡跳舞喝酒度過了一個美好的夜晚。  DJ 每晚都會更換，但每次我去的時候我都喜歡音樂。  調酒師也超酷。,"Here dancing and drinking a beautiful night.DJ will change every night, but every time I go, I like music.The bartender is also super cool."
各種各樣的飲料和音樂，披薩也很棒！這裡的氛圍是俱樂部和酒吧的混合體，如果您想度過一個低調的夜晚，這裡是很棒的選擇,"All kinds of beverages and music, pizza is also great!The atmosphere here is the mixture of the club and the bar. If you want to spend a low -key night, this is a great choice"
超級有趣，但有點小。調酒師非常好，人群總是友好而熱情。,"Super fun, but a little small.The bartender is very good, and the crowd is always friendly and enthusiastic."
很棒的氛圍和音樂，酒吧的管理人員很可愛。絕對推薦度過一個愉快的夜晚,"A great atmosphere and music, the management of the bar is very cute.Absolutely recommended to have a pleasant night"
良好的氛圍，美味的披薩，美味的啤酒。如果你不知道要去哪裡，這是一個放鬆的好地方！,"Good atmosphere, delicious pizza, delicious beer.If you don't know where to go, this is a good place to relax!"
很棒的酒吧！ DJ 非常棒，氣氛就像客廳派對一樣。,"A great bar!DJ is great, and the atmosphere is like the living room party."
這裡的 DJ 重點是 trance、techno 等帶有狂歡聲音的音樂。,"The DJs here focus on music with carnival, techno, etc. here."
很棒的氛圍，美味的啤酒和酷炫的音樂。如果您在該地區（即使您不在），請去看看！,"A great atmosphere, delicious beer and cool music.If you are in the area (even if you are not), please go and see!"
"推薦他們的歡樂時光20:00-22:00

Other DJ parties lasted until 3:00 in the morning"
