Smoke ribeye很讚，有露台可以看夜景，也有沙發可以坐，沒有規定用餐時間，可以晚餐時間一路待到結束時間很讚。,"Smoke Ribeye is very good. There are terraces to see night views, and some sofas to sit. There is no specified meal time. You can have a good time for dinner time to end."
"絕對是慶祝紀念日或是求婚的好聚所！

務必事前訂位，如果有指定桌席電話訂位且要注意一下低消的部分（好比說，求婚必勝桌低消是6000😂）。

店內在10點前都是走一個聚餐風格，10點後DJ進駐，會轉變成Bar風格，要注意你是前面時間吃飯的朋友但如果跨到這個時間點，可能會被酌收費用，可事先確認。

餐點方面，不愧是榮獲「50 Best Discovery」的餐廳，樣樣極致。服務人員得體且使人感到舒服。
飲品：推薦非酒精類的「Sakura Fubuki」，清甜帶有一絲櫻花香，令人留戀。
湯品：焗烤起司洋蔥湯香而厚實，帶有飽足感。
主餐：1. 波士頓龍蝦手工細扁麵不愧是大家推薦的，確實有其水準，風味十足，唯恐稍為搶了牛排的戲🤣2.日本F1和牛菲力，難得吃到目前最令我驚豔的牛排，即便推薦是5分熟，但我們怕太生索性點了7分，但卻依然十分優秀，炭火炙烤下的牛排表面焦脆，但將牛肉精華完全鎖在肉內，吃上一口，讚不絕口，可見其功力之高。
點心：巧克力蛋糕視覺上華美，可圈可點。

吃完走到外平台可遠眺信義區101，確實迷人。
整體吃完約會花上2小時左右，可自行評估時間，但也許下次來我也會嘗試他們家最讓人盛讚的酒品😇
備註：這裡消費這裡可以在萬豪飯店直接停車。","Definitely a good gathering of commemorative days or proposal!

Be sure to order in advance. If you have a designated table phone call and pay attention to the low -consumption part (like, the proposal will win at 6000😂).

Before 10 o'clock in the store, you have a dinner style. After 10 o'clock, DJ will be settled and will be transformed into BAR style. Pay attention to your friends who eat before. But if you cross this time, you may be charged. confirm.

In terms of meals, it is indeed a restaurant that has won ""50 Best Discovery"", and it is extremely extreme.The service staff is decent and makes people feel comfortable.
Drinks: Recommended ""Sakura Fubuki"", which is recommended, is sweet with a trace of cherry blossoms, which is nostalgic.
Decoction: Baked Kitza onion soup fragrance is thick and full, with satiety.
Main meal: 1. Boston lobster handmade fine flat noodles deserves to be recommended. It is indeed its standard and full of flavor, lest the drama for stealing. Steak, even if it is recommended for 5 points, but we are afraid that it is too much to order 7 points, but it is still very excellent. Praise is endless, showing its high skills.
Dim Sum: Chocolate cake visually gorgeous, remarkable.

After walking to the outer platform, you can overlook the Xinyi District 101, which is really charming.
It takes about 2 hours after eating dating, you can evaluate the time by yourself, but maybe next time I will try their most praise of the wine 😇
Remarks: Consumption here can park directly at the Marriott Hotel."
"這邊的景觀真的很美，一看出去對面就是101。
重點是玻璃超乾淨！！

餐點也很美味，氣氛滿分💯

今天跟女友求婚，非常謝謝服務人員的幫忙～","The landscape here is really beautiful. When you look out, you are 101.
The point is that the glass is super clean!Intersection

The meal is also delicious, the atmosphere is full

"在萬豪酒店的20樓餐廳景觀餐廳！

波士頓龍蝦🦞手工細扁麵：龍蝦很Q非常有彈性，義大利麵料理方式屬於偏硬的口感，味道非常美味！激推👍🏼

美國蛇河農場極黑和牛老饕牛排：牛排的周圍咬下去時，吃起來有點酥酥的口感，中間的肉則是非常鮮嫩，一吃下去就驚豔！

季節生蠔🦪：法國進口的生蠔，搭配提供的醬汁，酸酸甜甜很滑嫩！好鮮甜！

今天點了三杯 House wine，分別是：老藤的 Grenache、 Cabernet Sauvignon mix Merlot、Chardonnay，老藤的紅酒比較印象深刻，其他地方的單杯酒選擇很少，這裡紅白酒至少都有5種以上可以選擇。

餐廳整體是透明玻璃的設計，基本上都可以看見台北市的夜景，而當中最令人印象深刻的是他的大露台，台北市信義區的夜景一覽無遺，眺望著遠方的101，看著燈光閃爍，為美好的夜晚更加增添了浪漫的氛圍💕

餐廳的服務人員也讓我印象非常深刻，謝謝代付款、謝謝幫忙收好蛋糕、謝謝配合驚喜！

在這裏渡過了一個超級棒的夜晚，一場很美好的生日餐點！超級無敵推薦這家餐廳，雖然算是高價餐廳但是非常的值得！！大推！ 已經迫不及待想再去了！","Landscape restaurant on the 20th floor of Marriott Hotel!

Boston Lobster Handmade fine flat noodles: Lobster is very q and very flexible.Push 推

The American Snake River Farm is extremely dark and cattle old steak: When the steak was bitten, it tastes a bit crispy, and the meat in the middle is very tender, and it will be amazing when you eat it!

Seasonal oysters: oysters imported from France, with sauce provided, are sweet and sour and smooth!So sweet!

Today I ordered three cups of House Wine, namely: Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon Mix Merlot, and Chardonnay, the old vine. You can choose.

The restaurant as a whole is the design of transparent glass. Basically, you can see the night view of Taipei City. The most impressive is his big terrace. Flashing, adding a romantic atmosphere to a beautiful night 💕

The service staff of the restaurant also impressed me very deeply. Thank you for paying, thank you for helping with the cake, and thank you for the surprise!

I have spent a great night here, a beautiful birthday meal!Super invincible recommended this restaurant, although it is a high -priced restaurant, it is very worth it!IntersectionPush!I can't wait to go again!"
"今年的生日在這裡過
給自己一個舒服又開心的夜晚
雖然生日在昨日，但有在預定時候寫說，給自己一個舒服的生日，餐廳安排了很舒適的位置，讓我能欣賞外頭風景和享受美食，最後感謝服務人員給的驚喜小點心，還特別小唱生日歌，身為低調型人格的我，雖然很不好意思，但餐廳給予的祝福，我還是美美的收下♥️♥️

餐點精緻美味，牛肉恰到好處，無酒精調飲很爽口又好喝，舒服的一天，在這裡完美的句點。謝謝給予我這麼棒的感受體驗。","This year's birthday passed here
Give yourself a comfortable and happy night
Although the birthday was yesterday, I wrote in a scheduled time to give myself a comfortable birthday. The restaurant arranged a very comfortable position to allow me to enjoy the outside scenery and enjoy the food. Little singing birthday song, as a low -key personality, although I am very embarrassed, but the blessings given by the restaurant, I still accept it ♥ ️ ️ ️

The meal is delicate and delicious. The beef is just right. The wine without wine is refreshing and delicious. A comfortable day, the perfect period here.Thank you for giving me such a great experience."
夜景非常加分，和牛好吃，量非常剛好不會膩，麵包好吃，甜點選擇方式感覺不是很好，主廚現切擺盤，但似乎沒有特別加分，也會有可能吃不到想吃的蛋糕。整體比較適合喝酒聊天吃點小點,"The night view is very extra points, the cows are delicious, the amount is very just not tired, the bread is delicious, the dessert selection method does not feel very good. The chef is cutting the plate, but it seems that there is no special bonus. Eat cake.The overall is more suitable for drinking, chatting, eat a little bit"
酒食都不錯，服務也好，單價跟同星級餐廳比算高，因為有景觀，所以還會再來,"Wine and food are good, service, the unit price is higher than the same star restaurant, because there is a landscape, so I will come again"
"服務很好 我們遲到還會想辦法透過飯店跟我們確認會不會來用餐。
食物很好吃，牛排煙燻的方式很特別讓人難忘
此餐廳的價位跟101上面沽名釣譽的餐廳相比實惠非常多

整體我們非常滿意還會回來
唯一的建議是龍蝦應附上西方一定會有的butter dipping sauce 以提升龍蝦美味","The service is very good and we will find a way to confirm whether we will come to dine through the restaurant.
The food is delicious, and the way to smoke steak is very unforgettable
The price of this restaurant is much more affordable than the restaurant selling reputation on 101

We will be very satisfied with the whole
The only suggestion is that the lobster should be attached to the butter dipping sauce in the West to enhance the lobster deliciousness"
餐點好吃，調酒好喝，但是服務人員態度超級高傲，這次多給一顆星是給一位頭髮卷卷的女孩，介紹調酒很實在沒有亂推，另一位新來的小弟雖然不熟悉酒類介紹但是服務態度很好,"The meal is delicious, and the bartending is delicious, but the attitude of the service staff is super proud. This time, I give one star to a girl with a roller. The introduction of bartender is really not a mess. Another new younger brother Although I am not familiar with the introduction of the wine, the service attitude is very good"
"真的是超棒的餐廳
也感謝服務人員的代收服務
相當專業的跟我打pass，給女朋友很好的驚喜

座位種類有靠窗的也有吧台
我這次是電話先預訂半開放包廂
可以兼顧一些隱密感，又能直接看到101的漂亮夜景
整體氣氛很好，音樂舒服，環境安靜

酒單超級超級多，也有很多獨特調酒
餐點種類雖然比酒單少，但品質超棒
印象最深刻就是龍蝦麵和日本F1和牛菲力(5分熟)
龍蝦的部分鮮味超濃，身體的肉和螯的口感不同，當下吃完立刻就覺得下次可以的話一定要再點一次
F1和牛則是沒有A5的油膩感，吃起來很清爽，但也是有入口即化的感覺，烤的很棒
有三種配料可以沾，好的牛排真的沾鹽就是最好吃的！

其他配菜也是都有很不錯的表現！
另外，當月壽星電話預訂可以先講
他們會準備四吋巴斯克蛋糕，超棒

兩個人應該點一份主菜套餐+一個主菜+1-2種配菜應該就會飽了","It's really awesome restaurant
Thank you also for the service staff for receiving services
Quite professional with me, a good surprise for my girlfriend

The type of seat is also a window with the window
This time I book the phone first to book a semi -open box first
You can take into account some hidden secrets, and you can see the beautiful night view of 101 directly
The overall atmosphere is good, the music is comfortable, and the environment is quiet

The wine list is super super superb, and there are many unique bartender
Although there are fewer meals than wine, the quality is great
The most impressive is lobster noodles and Japan F1 and Niu Feili (5 points cooked)
Some of the lobster taste is super strong, and the taste of the body and the taste of the body is different. When you eat it now, you will feel that you must order it again next time.
F1 and Niu have no greasy feeling of A5.
There are three kinds of ingredients to dip, and good steaks are really delicious!

Other side dishes are also very good!
In addition, the Shouxing telephone booking of the month can be talked about first
They will prepare a four -inch Basque cake, superb

Two people should order a main dish package+a main dish+1-2 kinds of side dishes should be full"
萬豪酒店的INGE’s & Grill 有著相當美麗的夜景能清晰的遠眺松山機場，氣氛相當不錯。餐廳內的餐點也非常的有水準，尤其是牛排所給出的感受大勝台北相當多知名牛排館。肉的嫩度相當適中。沒有過多無謂的脂肪，熏蒸的香草香味把牛排的美味提升了一個層次，每一口都是一種享受！非常值得來吃看看！,"Marriott Hotel's Inge ’s & Grill has a pretty beautiful night view to clearly overlook Songshan Airport, and the atmosphere is quite good.The meals in the restaurant are also very standard, especially the feelings given by steaks are quite well -known in Taipei.The tenderness of the meat is quite moderate.Without too much unnecessary fat, the fumigation vanilla aroma has increased the deliciousness of the steak, and each bite is a kind of enjoyment!Very worth eating!"
非常滿意的用餐體驗，服務人員有禮，從帶位到點餐也專業有素養。當晚點選的三道主食擺盤、口味都令人讚賞，佐餐的酸種麵包是自個目前在台灣吃過最好吃的，佐以炒海鮮的湯汁更添美味，難忘的滋味。,"Very satisfactory dining experience, courteous service personnel, and professionalism from bringing positions to ordering.The three main food sets and tastes selected that night are all appreciated. The sour bread of the meal is the best food in Taiwan. The soup with seafood is even more delicious and unforgettable."
View很好，餐點偏重口，鴨肉鹽灑多了，調酒一般沒有驚艷,"View is very good, the meal is too heavy, the duck meat is sprinkled with a lot, and the bartender is generally not amazing."
20F外夜景很美，地點很棒！餐點精緻用心，22:00過後燈光暗下播放音樂，很chill!,"The 20F night view is beautiful, the location is great!The meal is exquisite, and after 22: 00, the lights are secretly played by the music, it is very chill!"
"我們兩人直接點了一份30oz的T bone 牛排。
餐點肯定是水準之上的，不論是食材、服務、擺盤、環境、景色都是👍👍👍

我還是要特別大讚服務人員，親切、專業，兩個小時讓我感受非常愉快。不論是餐點的介紹、最適合我們的口味推薦、無微不至和適時的桌邊服務，都👍👍👍👍👍。

來的時候是初一晚上，剛好天氣不錯，台北也車少，可以很安靜的觀賞夜景。

這一餐做為開春的第一個晚餐實在太巴適了😂😂😂😂😂","The two of us directly ordered a 30oz T Bone steak.
The meal is definitely above the standard. Whether it is ingredients, services, dishes, environment, and scenery, it is 👍👍👍

I still have to praise the service staff, kind and professional, and make me feel very happy for two hours.Whether it is the introduction of the meal, the most suitable taste recommendation, the meticulous and timely table service, it is 👍👍👍👍👍.

It was the day of the day when I came. It happened that the weather was good. There were few cars in Taipei, which could watch the night view quietly.

This meal is the first dinner in the spring."
高樓用餐景觀非常美 白天晚上來不同感覺，環境舒適高雅服務親切,"The landscape of high -rise meals is very beautiful during the day and night, and the environment is comfortable and elegant service."

6點晚餐，萬豪酒店進門左手邊電梯直上20樓，前往inge’s晚餐，親切的男服務人員為我們帶位，玻璃看出去是101跟松山機場的夜景很美⋯3人共點2份主菜搭配套餐跟1份單點主菜還有喝了2瓶氣泡水⋯很好喝⋯首先先上麵包，接著沙拉，然後主餐⋯最後有套餐甜點⋯因同行友人生日，所以有贈送一個4寸巴斯克乳酪蛋糕慶生⋯男服務人員拿著點著蠟燭的蛋糕進來，氣氛整個好浪漫💕在此吃飯看夜景加慶生，真的讓人難忘，inge’s高雅有氣氛，食物也很美味😋⋯謝謝讓我們一行人留下深刻回憶🫶謝謝男服務人員，超親切的服務品質⋯讓我覺得賓至如歸🫶","2024/2/29
At 6 o'clock for dinner, the elevator on the left hand side of the Marriott Hotel went straight to the 20th floor and went to INGE's dinner. The kind male service staff brought us the position. The glass seemed to be 101 and the night view of Songshan Airport. The package and one single -order main course and have 2 bottles of air bubbles. It ’s delicious. First, put on the bread first, then salad, and then the main meal. At the end, there is a set of desserts. Due to the birthday of your friends, there are 4 -inch bars. Ske cheese cake celebration birthday ⋯ male service staff came in with a cake with candles. The atmosphere was so romantic. Here to eat and watch the night scene and celebrate the birthday. It is really memorable. The group left a deep memory. Thank you for the service staff."
"週六晚上的慶生饗宴，入場的帶位與餐點介紹很細心，靠窗沙發座位非常舒服，但桌子有點小。
開胃菜是干貝佐鮭魚卵，干貝W嫩鮮甜，搭配鮭魚卵的提味更能凸顯，上菜時服務員的說明言簡意賅，但因為桌子小要不斷調整餐盤位置感覺挺累的，服務費應該就是算在這裡。
附餐的烤麵包酥脆到撕開時聽的見聲音，口感鬆軟充滿麥香，現在回憶是當天最驚艷的菜色（？
湯點選擇海鮮湯與巧達濃湯，海鮮湯沒有告知是番茄基底，友人表示不滿，我自己的巧達湯是挺好喝，馬鈴薯塊外酥內軟又入味讚讚
主餐是菲力牛排佐龍蝦，以兩人$8800的價位來說，好吃的中規中矩
畢竟這間店主打夜景，用餐的第一小時真的很美很適合相處，後來下雨就在室內欣賞雨都台北
總之不考量價格的情況下，這是一次很棒的用餐體驗","On Saturday night's celebration feast, the introduction and meal introduction of the entrance and meals are very careful. The window seats on the window are very comfortable, but the table is a bit small.
The appetizer is dried scallops salmon eggs. The scallops are tender and sweet, and the taste of salmon eggs can be more prominent. Just count here.
The baked noodles with a meal are crispy enough to see the sound when tearing, and the taste is soft and full of wheat fragrance. Now the memories are the most amazing dishes that day (?
Choose the seafood soup and Qianda soup. The seafood soup did not tell the tomato base. Friends expressed their dissatisfaction. My own Qianda soup is very delicious, the potato pieces are crispy and the inside is soft and praised.
The main meal is Fili Steak Saipan Lobster. From the price of two people for $ 8800, the delicious and well -known
After all, this shop owner played night views. The first hour of dining is really beautiful and suitable for getting along. Later, it rained and appreciated Yudu in the room.
In short, without considering the price, this is a great dining experience"
"無論是經典調酒或是店裏的特製調酒都非常出色
其中最喜歡Aviation（經典）
和
My spicy pisco sour（特調）

PS.稍微有點酒量的再嘗試唷！","Whether it is classic bartending or special bartending in the store, it is very good
Favorite Aviation (classic)
and
My Spicy Pisco Sour (Special)

Ps. Try a little bit of alcohol!"
第三次來用餐，桌數變少（有一區圈圍起來）、服務人員也變少！席間常找不到服務員。餐酒、燒烤料理、和龍蝦麵仍有水準,"For the third time, the number of tables has become less (there is a district circle), and the service staff will become less!There are often no waiters during the table.Meal wine, barbecue dishes, and lobster noodles are still standard"
美味，環境舒適，推介一試！,"Delicious and comfortable environment, try it!"
"前菜和龍蝦麵滿驚豔的
很精緻好吃
松露薯條也好吃但份量太大兩個人應該吃不完
主餐的牛排熟度已經超過所點的五分熟且有點乾
甜點就滿普通的
兩個人點兩個套餐下來要九千多元
另外就是如果指定窗邊座位會有低消六千
消費可以折抵停車4小時","The former dishes and lobster are amazing
Very delicate and delicious
Tulu French fries are also delicious, but the number of portions is too large. Two people should not be eaten
The steak matureness of the main meal has exceeded the five -point cooked and a little dry
Dessert is full of ordinary
Two people ordered two sets for more than 9,000 yuan
The other is that if there will be a low -consumption of 6,000 if the seat is specified by the window
Consumption can be discounted for 4 hours"
個人覺得不太符合價位的用餐經驗，沒特別記憶點。可能。。牛排確實有個特殊碳烤香味，還算好吃吧，但是真的太難切了，可能刀太鈍，空間冷氣非常冷，體感溫度15吧，外面夜景還行。,"Personally, I don't think it is in line with price dining experience, and there is no special memory point.possible.EssenceThe steak does have a special carbon grilled fragrance, which is delicious, but it is really too difficult to cut. It may be too blunt, the space is very cold, the body sensation is 15, the night view outside is okay."
"燈光美氣氛佳的好地方，建議大家還是要晚上去更美了，直接看到對岸的101，夜景超美，上次去的時候還是雨天，感覺帶點霧氣好有矇朧美啊，簡直就是很適合網美來取景拍照的氛圍！
就算是不在這裡用餐，這裡也提供了很多種類的調酒和飲料，餐點的份量也都算大的，比較偏美式風格的口味，調酒的賣相也都很好，不自覺得就會多點了幾杯，不知道是不是因為有酒精的加乘效果，越晚越覺得夜景越漂亮了，看到一大片的基隆河延岸建築的倒影，看著這樣的畫面，心情怎麼可能會不好呢？相信在這種環境下工作人員的應該都會心情愉悅了！","A good place with a beautiful light atmosphere. It is recommended that you still go more beautiful at night. You can see the 101 on the other side. The night view is super beautiful. It is still rainy when I went last time. It is very suitable for the atmosphere of net beauty to come and take pictures!
Even if you do n’t eat here, there are many types of bartending and drinks here. The amount of meals is quite large. It is relatively beautiful -style taste. A few more cups, I don’t know if it ’s because of the effect of alcohol. The later you feel that the night view is more beautiful. Seeing a large number of reflections of the Keelung River extended building. Looking at such a picture, how can you feel like you can feel mood? Not good?I believe that in this environment, staff should be in a happy mood!"

"當天有位女生的服務態度真的不敢恭維,我手舉著他就看著我走去做她的事情也沒有想過來服務的意思,後來是另外一名男服務員來協助。
再來因為是幫朋友過生日所以有準備蛋糕,上甜點環節時花跟餐廳準備的甜點都來了但是唯獨蛋糕沒有上來 我心想該不會出了什麼問題,後來店家有說要招待酒(但我們開車所以不能喝)所以就招待了無酒精飲品 後來蛋糕來了是聽他們說拿出來時有不小心毀損剛剛正在補救(約20分鐘吧)想說看著也沒有問題就也覺得算了
結果回家三個人都拉了肚子...","On the day, a girl's service attitude was really uncomfortable. When I held him, he looked at me and did not want to come to the service. Later, another male waiter helped.
Then because I have a birthday to help my friends, I have a cake to prepare for a cake. When the dessert session is on the dessert, the desserts prepared by the restaurant are here, but the cake did not come up. I thought that there would be any problems. Later But we drove, so we ca n’t drink it), so I entertaining the wine -free drink. After the cake came, when they heard them said that they were accidentally damaged when they were taken out (about 20 minutes)
As a result, all three people went home and pulled their stomachs ..."
氣氛很好的地方，可以一覽台北市的全景,"Where the atmosphere is good, you can see the panorama of Taipei City"
氣氛很棒，但是酒吧區的位置也太遠了，幾乎看不到什麼夜景，既然這樣，網頁說明要寫清楚。,"The atmosphere is great, but the position of the bar area is too far, and there is almost no night view. In this case, the webpage description should be written clearly."
服務爛透了…家人生日慶生到現場等15分鐘都沒人來服務.還需要自行去找服務員來點餐.這價位的餐廳服務還能做成這樣.餐點的部分本來選擇就不多.想點龍蝦餐竟然說沒貨了.這餐廳我看只有吃風景其他都不合格,The service is rotten ... The family ’s birthday celebrates the birthday and wait for 15 minutes to wait for the service. I also need to go to the waiter to order. The restaurant service at this price can be made like this. . I want to order lobster meals and say that I am out of stock. I think this restaurant is not qualified to eat the scenery.
"這次使用 2020 ITF 餐券來到萬豪酒店，擁有台北最佳夜景的餐酒館—Inge’s Bar & Grill，居高臨下，一覽台北市夜景與 101，並眺望松山機場的飛機起起落落，在此用餐真的令人很享受！

⭐️ 雙人海陸晚間套餐含：
1. 豪華海鮮塔 (波士頓龍蝦、生蠔)
龍蝦與生蠔都很新鮮又肥美，再配上特製的沾醬與醋，為海鮮增添不少風味，是不曾嚐過的滋味，實在難以忘懷！

2. 季節蔬果沙拉
時令水果是用鳳梨，蔬菜則有很多種，有許多平常不常見蔬果，並佐上一些堅果，讓平凡的沙拉也能不平凡！

3. 直火炭烤肋眼牛排12oz
雖然是三分熟，但是牛排表面很完美的用直火炭烤的方式把肉與油鎖在裡面，因此也不見血水，微微焦脆的表皮與肉質口感鮮嫩多汁相當互補，第一次嚐到牛排有多種口感滋味，這料理技術不愧為五星飯店！

4. 主廚精湛甜點
甜點的表現反而較普通，比較是吃精緻、看外觀造型的，且可惜的是兩位共享一份小小的甜點，讓人有點失望

5. 特調飲品(每人三款，共六杯)
每款 Shot 都好喝，畢竟是 Inge’s 的招牌！

服務態度都很好，讓家人聚餐有一個愉快的晚上，可惜我的的座位背靠他們的準備台，因此不斷聽到餐具的敲擊聲、服務生的交談聲還有跟廚房無線電聯繫的聲音，讓人有點困擾，這是唯一需要改進的地方。","This time I used the 2020 ITF meal coupon to the Marriott Hotel. It has the best night view of Taipei — in's Bar & Grill. Very enjoyable!

间️ Double sea and land evening package includes:
1. Luxury seafood tower (Boston lobster, oyster)
Both lobster and oysters are very fresh and fat. Coupled with special dipping sauce and vinegar, adding a lot of flavor to seafood. It is unforgettable that it has never tasted!

2. Seasonal fruits and vegetable salad
Seasonal fruits are pineapple, and there are many kinds of vegetables. There are many uncommon fruits and fruits, and some nuts are served, so that ordinary salads can be extraordinary!

3. Straight fire charcoal grilled rib eye steak 12oz
Although it is three -point, the surface of the steak is perfectly baked in the method of baking of straight -fire charcoal, so there is no blood water. The slightly crispy epidermis and the meat taste are fresh and juicy. The steak has a variety of taste. This cooking technology is worthy of being a five -star hotel!

4. Exquisite desserts of chefs
The performance of desserts is more ordinary. It is more delicate and looking at the appearance, and unfortunately, two shared a small dessert, which is a bit disappointed

5. Special drinks (three models per person, a total of six cups)
Each shot is delicious, after all, it is Inge ’s's signboard!

The service attitude is very good, so that my family has a pleasant night to dinner. Unfortunately, my seat is backed by their preparation table. It is a bit troublesome, which is the only place to improve."
"服務極爛！
服務態度極差，菜也普通，有錢花買一肚子氣也是滿厲害的！
只有景色值得一看。","The service is extremely bad!
The service attitude is very poor, the dishes are also ordinary, and the money to buy a stomach is also full!
Only the scenery is worth seeing."
"整體完全就是令人失望的一餐，服裝儀容規定很多，服務跟餐點卻沒有達到該有的水準。
前菜的海鮮不新鮮，餐包中規中矩就是一般的麵包，野菇湯跟海鮮湯都過鹹，完全沒辦法喝完，牛排算是整餐吃下來最優秀的，但同價位會有更好的選擇，主餐龍蝦麵沒了換成蛤蜊透抽鮮蝦麵，整體味道清淡，完全沒有海鮮的鮮甜，海鮮不夠新鮮都是腥味，這道菜也是難吃到吃不完，最後的甜點表現也不佳，感覺都在吃奶油，佐餐酒點了三杯，一杯紅酒、波特酒跟調酒都中規中矩沒有太特別。","The overall is a disappointing meal. There are many specifications of clothing and meals, but the service and meals have not reached the level.
The seafood of the former dish is not fresh. The meal bag is quite satisfactory. The wild mushroom soup and the seafood soup are too salty. The main meal lobster noodles are not replaced by clam transparent pumping fresh shrimp noodles. The overall taste is light. There is no freshness of seafood at all. The seafood is not fresh enough. Not good, I feel that I am eating cream. I ordered three cups of meals. A glass of red wine and Potter and bartender are not too special."
"**如果您有這間餐廳的預算，請直接選擇A cut或Smith，不要來浪費錢了**

這一顆星完全因為外面的景給的
點了兩個套餐，一個羔羊2680，一個F1和牛3600

湯品鹹到爆！蛤蜊很大顆沒錯，但真的死鹹到不行
點牛也沒有先問熟度

套餐裡有前菜、湯、主菜、甜點
上菜時完全不會介紹餐點，這種價位的東西你上菜至少說一句這是什麼東西吧？
排餐類都會有醬或是旁邊的菜，也完全沒說
甚至甜點直接上來也沒說什麼是什麼
放了就走真心傻眼

我們拿手機放桌上在看東西
你要放東西下來是應該先出聲說「不好意思」
而不是東西撞到我們手了才說「幫你上菜喔」
哈囉？？？？？

礦泉水一瓶280
第一次幫我們倒出來之後就直接放在桌上了
後來再也沒來倒過
然後跟我收了服務費620？？？？？
收什麼意思我不懂欸？？？？？

這種價位給我這種服務跟這種菜色
真的完全不能接受

啊當然除非你是想來看風景拍照的啦
那建議隨便點就好
不要當正餐，更不要當節日慶祝餐廳
送的生日瑪芬蛋糕超難吃，你乾脆不要送","** If you have the budget of this restaurant, please choose A CUT or Smith directly, don’t waste money **

There are front dishes, soups, main dishes, desserts in the package
I do n’t introduce meals at all when serving. Do you say at least one thing at this price?
There will be sauce or dishes next to meals, and I don't say it at all

"夜景非常漂亮的餐廳，可從餐廳內走出至戶外露台，可以享受270度的台北環境，大直的靜謐、河對岸台北市區的繁華，連101也能一覽無疑，當天是晚上來小酌，不過白天想必也是另有一番美景，十分建議在戶外區域用餐，如果在室內，也請務必走出去欣賞景觀。
晚上小酌低消為1人1千，如果1人兩杯酒，所有人再share一些餐點即可達到，酒類的部分有許多的店內特製調酒，成分及風味都有寫出，可以體驗看看。店內音樂比較大聲，如果希望熱鬧氣氛的很適合體驗，若想安靜喝酒聊天的可能要考慮一下。","The restaurant with a very beautiful night view can walk out of the restaurant to the outdoor terrace. You can enjoy a 270 -degree Taipei environment. However, it must be another beautiful scenery during the day. It is recommended to dine in the outdoor area. If you are indoors, please go out to enjoy the landscape.
The low drinking at night is 1,000. If 1 person and two glasses, everyone can share some meals. There are many special stores in the wine part of the wine. Experience.The music in the store is relatively loud. If you want the lively atmosphere, it is suitable for experience. If you want to drink quietly and chat, you may have to consider it."
不錯的環境、餐食也如裝潢和價位一樣符合期待，約會可以來。,The good environment and meals are as good as the decoration and the price. You can come to date.
服務跟夜景沒話說！薯條大堆，基本上龍蝦和配菜都好吃。不過老饕牛排還好，下次我應該會選菲力～,"The service has nothing to say with the night scene!A lot of fries, basically lobster and side dishes are delicious.But the old steak is okay, next time I should choose Fili ~"
"一個可以看台北的地方。
調酒很不錯，我很喜歡這杯Inge’s tea time，有茶香又有熱帶果香，很清爽的一杯。
非常推薦他們家的羅西尼牛排，基本上我是不吃內臟的人，但是他家的鴨肝完全沒有腥味（美福的鴨肝醬完全不行，Raw的我只感覺一般般）表皮有焦香，跟軟嫩的牛排搭起來簡直不要太適合，是我第一次覺得這樣的搭配是好吃的。
漁夫湯不錯，龍蝦麵還好。可能因為有龍蝦所以價格偏貴，其實我沒特別想吃龍蝦的，只是剛好他都要加龍蝦我也很困擾。
出乎意料喜歡的是松露薯條！我是個很難覺得有比麥當勞薯條更好吃的薯條的人，去其他美式餐廳人家說薯條很好吃我也就覺得大概比麥當勞好一點點而已。但是，他家的薯條搭著松露鹽再沾番茄醬真的有讓我覺得比麥當當高出兩個標準差欸!!!（但朋友之前吃過說他覺得還好，也許品質不一定穩定？）

在室內就可以看到整片101，夜景真的是沒話說。

萬豪有許多自己風味的特調，感覺沒事就可以走過來喝一杯，配個薯條，享受一下這片豪華的夜景。","One where you can see Taipei.
I am very good. I like this cup of Inge ’s Tea Time. There are tea and tropical fruits. It is a refreshing cup.
The Rosinini steak is very recommended. Basically, I am a person who does not eat internal organs, but his duck liver has no fishy smell at all (Meifu's duck liver sauce is not enough, RAW, I only feel ordinary), the epidermis has the epidermis. Jiao Xiang, do n’t match the soft and tender steak. It ’s the first time that I think this kind of match is delicious.
Fisherman's soup is good, lobster noodles are okay.Maybe because there are lobsters, the price is expensive. In fact, I don't particularly want to eat lobster, but just happened to be a lobster, I am also very troublesome.
Unexpectedly, it is truffle fries!I am a person who is hard to think that there are fries that are better than McDonald's fries. When I go to other American restaurants, people say that the fries are delicious. I think it ’s probably a little better than McDonald's.However, his french fries with truffle salt and then dipped tomato sauce really made me feel that there are two standard deviations higher than McDonald in !!! (But friends have eaten before that he thinks it is okay, maybe the quality may not necessarily necessarily have Stablize?)

You can see the whole piece 101 in the room. The night scene is really nothing.

Marriott has a lot of special specialties. If you feel okay, you can come over to drink a drink, with a fries, and enjoy this luxurious night view."

"萬豪20樓的高空美景！

我得說INGE’s 在氛圍、裝潢、地點選擇都做的絕佳，坐擁20樓的美景，還可以直視101，天氣好的夜晚真的很美，不管是跟三兩朋友聚聚或是情侶兩人約會，怎麼樣都會是滿足的夜晚！而最後，加上美食，更是次次都是美好的體驗～

食物方面，個人覺得不管是龍蝦義大利麵還是安格斯牛排都是好吃的，食材新鮮部位優，以傳統的美式轟炸來俘虜他人的胃，海鮮盤更是精彩，多種海鮮炭烤過呈現在眼前，讓人大快朵頤，不過相對來說，技術與食材烹飪掌握雖然好，但創意性就一班班，食材的高級更是直接反映在價格上，所以如此好表現是應該的！

調酒方面倒是非常亮眼，不知大家怎麼想，但我每次來INGE’s時，每次都調酒都是好喝的，有層次又有創意，臨時想試試別的特別的，跟bartender 說一聲也能搭配喜好調出合適的，且層次感豐盛，價格也相對合理，不會因為在飯店就過高，讓人滿意！

總之，非常推薦大家前來，不管是聚餐還是約會～","The high -altitude scenery on the 20th floor of Marriott!

I have to say that INGE'S has done well in the atmosphere, decoration, and location choices. Sitting on the beautiful scenery on the 20th floor, you can also look directly at 101. The weather in good weather is really beautiful, whether you are gathered with three or two friends or couples How can the two dating, how can it be a satisfying night!In the end, with the food, it is a good experience again ~

In terms of food, I personally think that whether it is the Italian noodles of the lobster or the Angus steak, it is delicious. The fresh parts of the ingredients are excellent. It is a traditional American bombing to capture the stomach of others. The seafood plate is even more exciting. It is presented in front of the eyes, which is fast, but relatively speaking, although the mastery of technology and ingredients is good, the creativity is in the first class, and the advanced ingredients are directly reflected in the price, so it should be so good performance!

It is very eye -catching in bartending. I do n’t know what everyone thinks, but every time I come to Inge's, I bartender is delicious every time. It can also be used with preferences, and the sense of layering is rich, and the price is relatively reasonable. It will not be satisfactory because it is too high in the restaurant!

In short, I recommend everyone to come, whether it is a dinner or a date ~"

👉🏻IG: jjiiee._

這間風景真的超美，氣氛很好，在室內用完餐後可以去外面的露台看夜景☺️（附上一張超美夜景照片），點了一份精選套餐（主菜是美國頂級牛小排），另外單點一份台灣戰斧豬排和兩杯調酒！

🔸餐前點心、前菜、湯（套餐）
這幾樣感覺比較像是創意料理，在口感和味蕾的部分可以帶來新的體驗，但很難形容他的味道🤔

🔸戰斧豬排（單點）
這個真的很有份量，以炭烤的方式將整個豬排的精華鎖在裡面，搭配上面的醬汁，真的很好吃，尤其在豬皮和肥肉的部分，很驚艷，豬皮很有彈性，但不會過硬，肥肉完全不膩，很快就融化！搭配旁邊烤過的蒜更讚，蒜的辣度已因烤熟而緩和，卻保留淡淡的蒜香，推推👍🏻

🔸牛小排（套餐）
這道一樣是以炭烤的方式鎖住肉汁，不會有血水，也沒有肉腥味，很嫩！搭配旁邊的蛋黃與蔬菜，很特別！喜歡！🥰

🔸甜點（套餐）
甜食實在不是我的強項，無法分辨好吃與否，但兩者都不會太甜膩，還不錯👌🏻

🔸熱紅酒（單點）
可以自由選擇放入果乾和香料，我覺得對我而言有點太甜，所以我把迷迭香放在裡面久一點，可以淡化太甜的口感🍷

🔸琴酒（單點）
這個真的很好喝，喝起來有淡淡的菊花香氣，酒精的味道也不會太嗆，我很喜歡❤️

🔍P.S有低消唷！","People who like to share food and life are welcome to track 💁🏻‍♀️😊
IIg: jjiiee._

This scenery is really beautiful, and the atmosphere is very good. After meals in the room, you can go to the terrace outside to see the night scene ☺️ (attached a super beautiful night view) and order a selected package (the main cuisine is the top American beef Xiaoxiao Xiaoxiao Xiaoxiao Volume), another one or two cups of bartender in Taiwan Tomahawk pork chop and two cups of bartender!

前 前 🔸 snacks, front dishes, soup (package)
These are more like creative dishes. The part of the taste and taste buds can bring a new experience, but it is difficult to describe his taste 🤔

单 Tomahawk pork chop (single point)
This is really a weight. The essence of the entire pork chop is locked inside with charcoal roasting. With the sauce above, it is really delicious, especially in the pigs and fat parts. Elasticity, but not too hard, fat is not greasy at all, and quickly melts!It is even more baked with the grilled garlic, the spicyness of the garlic has been eased due to cooked, but it retains a faint garlic aroma and pushes it.

） 餐 🔸 🔸 (package)
This is the same to lock the gravy in a charcoal grilled manner, there will be no blood, no meaty smell, very tender!It is very special with the egg yolk and vegetables next to it!like!Bleak

） Dessert (package)
The sweetness is not my strength, can’t distinguish whether it is delicious, but neither will be too sweet, not bad.

） Hot red wine (single point)
You can freely choose to put dried fruit and spices. I think it is a bit too sweet to me, so I put rosemary in it for a long time, and I can fade the taste of too sweet 🍷

） Qin wine (single point)
This is really delicious. It has a faint fragrance of chrysanthemum, and the taste of alcohol will not be too stingy. I like it very much ❤️

"🌝180度台北市景+夜景真的讚

🌚晚餐Table低消$5000/2人
覺得真是莫名奇妙的貴
🌚水費$100提供礦泉水/汽泡水
（ㄧ直提供到22:00）

🌝服務人員接待：
挑週間晚上18:00用餐
服務人員口氣算禮貌
水杯有杯墊，也很常巡場加水
盤子和餐具都整理的很快
推薦佐餐酒也算是有問有答
另外告知服務人員是來慶生用餐
還獲得一份驚喜點心和甜酒

🌝餐點
點了$2500的3oz紐約客牛排套餐
從前菜到甜點都還算可以
盤子是日式風格的陶盤很美
餐後加點的串燒和烤魚卵亦是非常美味可口

🌚個人不負責任建議

1.如此高消費的餐廳，
桌上竟然沒有任何濕紙巾，只有乾紙巾
建議正餐時間應在餐前或餐後提供濕紙巾給客人。

2.希望服務人員能多點和客人互動，
問問餐點滿意度等..會更增加親切感。

4.萬豪酒店的停車場費用是$100/小時，
我們兩人消費了$5500多
從18:00待到22:30，
沒想到消磁完感應後，分享還要再付$50停車費，
建議來此用餐的朋友
還是要留意ㄧ下餐點的低消可以折抵的時間

🉐️結論：
想和三五好友來此聚餐品酒看夜景很適合
但是餐點的價格我覺得不符其實
畢竟是高級酒店內的Bar
服務人員的訓練應該再更專業更貼心些","市180 degrees Taipei City scene+night scene really praise

低 Dinner Table low -elimination of $ 5000/2 people
I think it's really inexplicable

🌝 Service staff reception:
Pick the week to dine at 18:00 in the evening
Service personnel are polite
There are coasters in the water cup, and they are also very frequently touched to add water
Both the plate and the tableware are tidy fast
Recommended meal wine can also be regarded as questions and answers
In addition, the service personnel are here to celebrate the birthday dining
Also get a surprise snack and sweet wine

Meal
Ordered $ 2500 3OZ New York guest bull steak package
It's okay from the front dish to the dessert
The plate is a Japanese -style pottery plate is beautiful
Add some skewers and grilled fish eggs after the meal are also very delicious

建 Personal irresponsible suggestions

1. Such a high -consumption restaurant,
There is no wet tissue on the table, only dry paper towels
It is recommended to provide wet paper towels to guests before or after meals.

2. I hope that the service personnel can interact more with the guests,
Ask meals satisfaction, etc., will increase intimacy.

4. The cost of the parking lot of the Marriott Hotel is $ 100/hour,
The two of us spent more than $ 5500
Stay from 18:00 to 22:30,
Unexpectedly, after the induced sensation, the parking fee will be paid by another $ 50.
Friends who are recommended to come here
Still pay attention to the time when the low disappearance of the meal can be discounted

🉐️ Conclusion:
Want to come here with three or five friends to dinner and wine to watch the night view is very suitable
But the price of meals is not true
After all, it is BAR in high -end hotels
The training of service staff should be more professional and more intimate"

"很棒！！超乎期待～
窗邊位置低消$5000，
這次吃下來大約$7000多（我們沒搭配套餐都是單點）。

服務生挺會推薦酒飲和菜色，也會適當注意點的餐點及份量，後續也都會了解我們對餐點的滿意度及狀況，覺得很棒，是個男服務生，可惜不太記得名字，印象中是J開頭。

Tea time真的讓我很驚艷，味道十分清爽的調酒，原本覺得太淡，後面越喝越順，微醺感很恰當，很適合女生。

還有點干貝燒（超級推！）、肋眼牛排24oz，（濕潤感，還不錯）、漁夫鮮湯（龍蝦超棒！）、還有一個牛肉什麼的忘記名字了也好吃，唯一覺得比較不推的是松露薯條，很鹹無法吃多，重點是鹹味都蓋過松露了，沒什麼松露香味，除此之外都很喜歡。

絕對是再訪清單中！","Very good!!Extra looking forward to ~

"5點半抵達後，先到外面的陽台看看風景，並享受一杯martini，微風徐徐，真是很愜意。

主餐有套餐跟單點的形式，朋友點了牛排套餐，我個人點了燒烤拼盤跟戰斧豬排，燒烤拼盤有後切牛舌、花枝、香腸、跟玉米筍，個人覺得還算不錯，不過食物感覺沒有很燙，小缺點。分量還算不錯，分食沒問題。戰斧豬排，一上桌很吸引眼球，且還滿好吃的。烤的軟嫩，調味也還算可以。有用酒需求的話，服務生直接推了一車過來介紹，還可以試喝一下推薦的品項，這點我覺得很不錯。

跟朋友聚會的氛圍不錯。訂位時也可以直接要求在陽台，不過陽台不能吃主餐，僅小點。餐廳內每個位置都有低消的要求，從2000元起，可在訂位時詢問。","After arriving at 5:30, go to the balcony outside to see the scenery and enjoy a glass of Martini. The breeze is so comfortable.

The main meal has a package and a single point. My friend ordered a steak package. I personally ordered the barbecue platter and the war ax pork chop. The food feels not very hot, small disadvantages.The weight is not bad, there is no problem with food.Tomahawk pork chop is very eye -catching when the table is on the table, and it is delicious.Bake is soft and tender, and the seasoning is okay.If there is a need for wine, the waiter directly pushes a car to introduce, and you can try to drink the recommended items. I feel very good.

The atmosphere of meeting with friends is good.You can also be directly required to be on the balcony when you order, but the balcony cannot eat the main meal, only a little bit.Each position in the restaurant has a low demand for low consumption.

"※有附設車位，消費可抵停車費
※雖然樓層不高，但20樓的景色很不錯
※10點之後會變成BAR，氣氛不賴
※比較適合把妹或是上來喝酒，吃正餐我是覺得還好~~

消費日期：2020/9/8
消費人數：5人
消費金額：應該是1萬8元左右吧
消費內容：5個2500元的套餐 (需加收10%服務費)，另外加點「勞力士」生蠔以及3杯酒+2杯咖啡

※環境：
整體環境算是走一個低調奢華的路線，停車場無法直接上20樓，需要繞一下路，廁所以及環境都是蠻乾淨的。外面的露台區可以看夜景。應該算是把妹的好地方。

※餐點內容：
套餐內容大概就五道菜左右
前菜(西瓜起士培根)、熱前菜(烤九孔)、湯品(淡菜濃湯)、主菜(豬勒排)、甜點，水的話可以選一般水或是氣泡水。

整體來說，口味上算是中間，要說多好吃或是多難忘，我是覺得還好，份量上，算是剛好吃飽，但絕對不會撐。烤九孔和濃湯、甜點都不錯，豬勒排蠻普的

勞力士生蠔值得點一下，一顆300。意外的不會腥。
酒的話一般大概400左右，咖啡大概250上下

值得再訪嗎？下次想裝逼的話會再考慮","※ There are attached parking spaces, consumption can be worth the parking fee

Consumption amount: It should be about 18 yuan, right?
Consumption content: 5 2500 yuan package (10%service fee is required), and add some ""Rolex"" oysters and 3 cups of wine+2 cups of coffee

※environment:
The overall environment is a low -key luxury route. The parking lot cannot be directly on the 20th floor. You need to go around the road. The toilet and the environment are quite clean.You can see the night view on the terrace area outside.It should be regarded as a good place for girls.

※ Meal content:
The content of the package is about five dishes
Previous dishes (watermelon cheese bacon), hot front dishes (roasted nine holes), soup (light vegetable soup), main dish (pigle tensor), desserts, water can be selected for normal water or bubble water.

Overall, the taste is the middle. How delicious or unforgettable, I think it's okay. In terms of weight, it is just full, but it will never support it.Bake nine holes and thick soups and desserts are good.

Rolex oysters are worth pointing, one 300.The accident will not be fishy.
For wine, it is generally about 400, and coffee is about 250 up and down

餐點在創意、火候、調味都需要再加強，整頓吃下來沒有豐富或驚艷的感覺，上菜節奏也忽快忽慢，服務生有漏掉加價點菜的部份，處理方式也不好、一直想追加感覺勉強。此外電話訂位時，服務員態度有點不耐煩、沒能好好介紹消費方式，以五星級飯店來說不應該。
餐廳裝潢跟夜景倒是很不錯，調酒也蠻好喝，會想再來小酌，不會想再來用餐。

Highly recommended for cocktails and beautiful view. Not recommended for dining here. Food is pricy and services could be improved.","February-2018
7 Courses Set Menu $ 2500+10%
Wine / Cocktail Pailing $ 1100+10%

The meals need to be strengthened in creativity, heat, and seasoning. There is no rich or amazing feeling for rectification and eating. The rhythm of serving is also slow. I have always wanted to add barely.In addition, when calling the phone, the waiter is a bit impatient and cannot introduce the consumption method well. For five -star restaurants, it should not be.
The decoration and night view of the restaurant are very good, and the bartending is quite delicious. I want to have a drink again, and I don't want to dine again.

Highly Recominged for Cocktails and Beautiful View. Not Recomgeded for Dining Here."

雖然是訂了專案才來用餐，但嚐過百萬烤爐直火碳烤的美國頂級肋眼牛排，就決定下次會專程來用餐，碳烤後油脂的味道，真的太美味了，黑松露馬鈴薯泥更是讚嘆！意猶未盡直接連男友的那份都吃了，角蝦殼雖薄但很新鮮只可惜肉太少，也許是嚐海味的而已？用餐後到室外看看夜景，享受一個愉快的夜晚。 …","If I think my comments or pictures are helpful, please encourage me to help me press, thank you ...
Although I have a project before dining, I have tasted the top American rib s steak that tasted a million stoves of straight fire carbon, so I decided to make a special trip next time. Rhuda potato puree is even more admirable!The meaning is still eating the boyfriend's part. Although the corner shrimp shell is thin but fresh, it is a pity that the meat is too small. Maybe it is just a taste of the sea?After meals, go out outdoors to see the night view and enjoy a pleasant night.Mowing"
"用餐不推薦。
帶朋友來喝酒還可以，有種出國到了高空酒吧的感覺，但以酒來說也不是很對我的胃口，很多人推薦的tea time 我也不算太喜歡，更喜歡其他信義區的調酒餐廳。
景色真的超棒沒話說。","It is not recommended for meals.
It is okay to bring friends to drink. There is a feeling of going abroad to a high -altitude bar, but in terms of wine, I don’t have an appetite for me. I don’t like it too much about Tea Time recommended by many people. Dining room.
The scenery is really superb."
"景取勝的環境
餐點有在水準之上 但食材（部份海鮮）感覺上有些許不到水準

另外戶外的地磚有片已經裂了 也該更換掉了

整體而言 消費是高檔飯店的水準 氣氛不錯
就是有些吵 畢竟是酒吧 所以也不能奢求太多

餐飲有特色
如果你是要求CP值的 那這就可能不合適了","Scenery
The meal is above the standard but the ingredients (part of the seafood) feel a little less than the level

In addition, the outdoor floor tiles have a film that has been cracked and it should be replaced

Overall, consumption is a good atmosphere of high -end hotels
It's just a bit noisy, after all, it's a bar, so you can’t ask too much

俯瞰台北夜景，輕鬆寫意的美食空間。今天和家人選擇來這邊慶生，有一個很大的原因因為他們可以接受帶小朋友，這一點感激萬分。一到20樓的餐廳映入眼簾的是絕美的夜景和輕鬆的氣氛，打開菜單除了有主食以外前菜和下酒小點也是非常的吸引人， 隨意點了幾道菜都非常的美味。帶了生日蛋糕去，服務生很主動的幫我們冰起來，拿出來的時候還幫忙裝盤以及撒上玫瑰花瓣，非常的貼心。停車場非常的明亮寬敞而且平緩，這一點更是加分。,"Overlooking the night view of Taipei, easy freehand food space.There is a big reason for choosing to come here to celebrate his birthday today because they can accept children, which is very grateful.The restaurant on the one to 20th is a beautiful night view and a relaxed atmosphere. It is also very attractive to open the menu except that there is a staple food and a little bit of wine. It is very delicious to order a few dishes at will.Bring a birthday cake, the waiter actively helped us iced. When we took it out, they also helped put on the plate and sprinkled rose petals. It was very intimate.The parking lot is very bright, spacious and gentle, and this is even more points."
"餐廳位於台北萬豪酒店20F,正面對松山機場還有遠方的101大樓。風景及用餐環境沒話說。但是就價位及餐點而言，C/P值就略遜於其他高檔的牛排餐廳。","The restaurant is located at the 20F of Taipei Marriott Hotel, and there is a 101 building in the distance between Songshan Airport.There is nothing to say about the landscape and dining environment.But in terms of price and meals, the C/P value is slightly inferior to other high -end steak restaurants."
可以眺望台北市，晚上夜景信義區就在眼前，可以看的松山機場的飛機起降，很棒的地方，有簡單的料理跟酒精類飲料，價格不便宜，但值得！,"You can look at Taipei City. At night, the night scene Xinyi District is in front of you. The aircraft of Songshan Airport that can be seen. It is great. There are simple dishes and alcoholic beverages. The price is not cheap, but it is worth it!"
樓高風景不錯且有陽台可以走出拍照看景，但食物不值它的價格，點了肋眼牛排及海鮮盤套餐(含前菜、湯及甜點)，三樣配菜(烤蔬菜、通心粉、薯條)，兩杯調酒，消費一萬一千多元。有點離譜的是配菜與前菜同時上桌，40分鐘後上湯，再15分鐘後上主菜，此時配菜已經全冷，跟侍者反應的答覆是沉默無言...,"Lou Gao's scenery is good and there is a balcony to get out of the photo to see the scene, but the food is not worth the price. ), Two cups of bartending, spending more than 11,000 yuan.A bit outrageous is that the side dishes are served at the same time at the same time, and after 40 minutes, the soup is served, and the main course will be served in 15 minutes. At this time, the side dishes are already cold."
景觀美，氣氛佳，餐點套餐有稍稍貴一點，五星級飯店嘛，其實也沒貴到那裏去！套餐的海鮮湯同行友人讚歎不已，露台是拍照的好地方，建議黃昏時就進場，這樣可以看到白天跟晚上的景色！靠窗位有低消，不過，不難達到就是了！,"The landscape is beautiful, the atmosphere is good, the meal package is slightly more expensive, the five -star hotel, in fact, it is not expensive there!The package of seafood soup with the package is amazed. The terrace is a good place for taking pictures. It is recommended to enter the venue at dusk, so that you can see the scenery of the day and night!The window position is low, but it is not difficult to achieve!"
首次嘗試除夕套餐，當晚餐廳只做一場，不趕時間，可以慢慢享受，整體六道，有的讓人驚艷，有些菜色口味偏鹹，就只能多喝水，上菜速度中間可以再拉長一點點比較不會有趕攤的感覺，讓人可以更細細品味餐點，聊聊天，用餐環境很寬敞，舒服，有平台可以到外面看飛機起降，有吧檯，可以先喝一杯再慢慢入座，可惜沒有專業的侍酒師，只能自己點自己想喝的酒試著自己搭餐，如果有wine pairing或是cocktail pairing相信可以帶給客人更完整的體驗，題外話，一開始有看到店員拿著拍照工具詢問入座客人是否要幫忙到外面拍照，在酒吧的我們沒被詢問，外套的部分有的人有幫忙掛外套服務，有的隨意放在沙發上，不知道服務的標準在哪裡？有差別服務的感覺，讓人不是很舒服……,"For the first time I tried the New Year's Eve set meal, the dinner room had only one game that dinner. If you do n’t hurry, you can enjoy it slowly. The overall six roads are amazing. Some dishes are salty. You can only drink plenty of water. It will not feel like a stall, so that people can taste more delicate meals, chat, the dining environment is very spacious and comfortable. There is a platform to watch the aircraft take off and land outside. Slowly sitting, unfortunately there is no professional sommelier, you can only order the wine you want to drink for your own meal. Someone saw the clerk holding a photo tool to ask the guests to help take pictures outside. We were not asked in the bar. Where is the standard?It feels like a different service, it is not very comfortable ..."
風景很美，調酒好喝，餐點美味。服務人員態度良好。但美中不足的是音樂太大聲、以電音為主、ㄧ些年輕的客人嘻鬧、覺得好吵，若音樂小聲點，會較好,"The scenery is beautiful, the bartender is delicious, and the meals are delicious.The service staff has a good attitude.But the disadvantage of the United States is that the music is too loud, mainly electronic sound, and some young guests who make trouble and feel noisy. If the music is whispering, it will be better"
"萬豪酒店的景非常得好只是交通非常的不方便，
此酒吧生意非常好需要提前預約，
人非常的多但是服務人員裡面的接待態度非常良好，可惜就是有點人手不夠，不是假日是平日人手都稍嫌不夠，調酒都非常的用心也非常的美麗，不知道喝什麼也可以詢問也會給你誠摯的推薦，除了櫃檯代位的小姐比較嚴格跟臭臉以外，其他的人員基本上都是算非常的服務到位。
酒好喝偏貴但是和氣氛非常好","The scene of the Marriott Hotel is very good but the traffic is very inconvenient.
This bar business is very good, you need to make an appointment in advance,
There are a lot of people, but the reception attitude in the service staff is very good. Unfortunately, some people are not handsome. It ’s not that the people are not enough on weekdays. The bartending is very careful and very beautiful. For your sincere recommendation, in addition to the strict and stinky faces, other personnel are basically very service.
The wine is good and expensive, but the atmosphere is very good"
"氣氛佳、夜景美已經很愉悅人心，再加上親切專業的服務Wii的服務，整個用餐過程很開心❤️！
餐點炭烤牛肉五盎司，三分口感優於五分，口味很不錯；海陸盤（含一隻龍蝦🦞+兩個螃蟹鰲+六盎司紐約克換法式春雞加800元，建議不要換），side dish🈶️洋芋一片，烤蕃茄6顆，海鮮很Q彈新鮮！單點的松露玉米湯很👍，每顆玉米粒烤過很有口感；套餐內的湯是白花耶菜湯沒有喜歡，口味很像鄉下的高麗菜干！
萬豪20樓INGE’S Bar&Grill很值得嚐嚐！ …","The atmosphere and the beauty of the night scene are already very happy. Coupled with the friendly and professional service Wii service, the whole meal process is very happy ❤️!
Meals of five ounces of charcoal grilled beef, three -point taste is better than five points, and the taste is very good; Hai and Lu Dan (including one lobster 🦞+two crab oao+six ounces of New York gram change French spring chicken plus 800 yuan, it is recommended not to change) , Side Dishe️ a potato, 6 roasted tomatoes, seafood is very new!The single -point truffle corn soup is very stingy, and each corn grain is grilled very tasteful; the soup in the package is white flower and vegetable soup, and the taste is very much like the dried Korean cabbage in the country!

"這裡的美景真的是很讚，如果手持iPhone11或12真的是可以拍的超級無敵美~~
我們是來慶生的，店家就主動給shot還有杯子蛋糕，真的很貼心！
餐點非常美味~~戰斧豬排大推~價格我記得是1580，如果大家一起分食就不會太貴！
羊排也很好吃，但是有些微的腥味，但是算已經處理的很好了！
串燒類的還有魚卵~很適合當下酒菜
麻辣滷味也用得很美味！讓我們大家都蠻驚豔~很入味！
只有一口的牛肉三明治，搭配牛骨髓醬，搭配感十足！覺得很像在吃精品，牛肉也煎的剛剛好，香氣四溢。
松露薯條也必點，但如果松露再給大方一點就更好了！薯漿很多，不會炸過老~
義大利麵的麵體有入味，不會感覺醬是醬，麵是麵。
有美食和美酒的搭配，再加上夜晚美景，真的是值得來一趟享受！","The beauty here is really great. If you hold the iPhone11 or 12 is really a super invincible beauty ~~
We came to celebrate our birthday, and the store took the initiative to give Shot and cup cake, which is really intimate!
The meal is very delicious ~~ Tomahawk pork chop is pushed ~ I remember it is 1580, if everyone split together, it will not be too expensive!
The lamb chops are also delicious, but a little fishy smell, but it has been dealt with well!
There are fish eggs in skewers ~ very suitable for the current wine and vegetables
Spicy loquat also uses delicious!Let us all amazing ~ It is very delicious!
There is only a bite of beef sandwiches, with beef bone marrow sauce, full of matching!I feel like eating boutique, and the beef is just right and the aroma overflows.
Tulu potato strips must also be ordered, but it would be better if truffle is given to generosity!There are a lot of potato pulp, and I won't be fried ~
The facade of the Italian noodles is flavorful, and it will not feel that the sauce is sauce, and the noodles are noodles.
With the combination of food and wine, coupled with the beauty of the night, it is really worth enjoying!"
"到訪的時間是星期六晚上十點的時間，其實已經過了用餐的尖峰時間，但是剛好進入看夜景、續攤、放鬆心情找地方聊天的尖峰，所以到了現場室內座位已經客滿，只剩下外面的座位。

在接待區等待服務人員確認後，告知一個人的低消是 $1000 ＋ 10%，這與當初在官網以及眾多網頁資料看到的不同，大部份都是標示 $500 ＋ 10%，不曉得是否因為假日還是剛好有萬聖節的活動，總之，要到入內的消費模式就是上述的 【$1000 ＋ 10%】而且不是個人桌，而是與別人併桌，但是服務人員會先帶位，看一下實際位置，可以接受的話，才會開始計費，並不會直接強迫接受。

實際看了座位後，其實說併桌，應該是說坐在同一個區塊，外面風大＋開放式空間，其實不會有併桌感，朋友可接受，我個人就沒問題，因為空間跟整體過程都算是舒適。

雖然計價方式與一開始理解的不同，但是看了許多假日時間可在高樓看夜景的酒吧，基本上都不是低消費，所以心裡並無太大的落差，而空間舒服跟夜景美麗我覺得是最大的吸引力與賣點。

原本有詢問訂位一事，室內是可訂位，但是座位數少，一下就被訂滿，有另外一個訂位模式，但低消好像是 8000 的樣子（實際金額忘了），如果人多一起分攤其實也還好。

看到這邊，可能某些人會覺得低消過高，但是說真的，一個提供 交通便利 ＋ 美麗夜景 ＋ 開放式座位 ＋ 好喝的調酒（無酒精特調）＋ 簡單餐點 ＋ 無時間限制 的各種條件下，其實這個消費模式我覺得不過份。而且外面待久了，覺得風太大，覺得太冷，也可以換到裡面位置（但必須要有空位）不會另外再加價。

酒單我覺得也很豐富，無論男女，喜愛各種酒的，應該這邊都可以滿足，這邊提供 特調烈酒、原創雞尾酒、氣泡雞尾酒、低酒精雞尾酒、無酒精雞尾酒、威士忌、軟性飲料(茶、咖啡、汽水)等等....

下酒的餐點部份，有生蠔、培根、果仁、炸地瓜、火腿起司球、雞翅、沙拉、串燒、滷味、冷肉盤等等

實際喝了好幾杯特調飲品，說真的，我個人是覺得很好喝，而且服務也好，很客氣又很快速，隨時都充滿笑容，而且上飲品的速度也快，在服務方面我個人是給滿分，服務完全沒有怠慢，在一個這麼棒的空間，能有良好的體驗，說真的不簡單。而且我們是比較愜意的享受飲品跟美景，沒有點任何餐點，但是過程中，服務人員應該是擔心我們沒有點到低消又要付低消，怕客人吃虧，有貼心提醒許多次是可以再追加飲品跟餐點，因為其實已經在上一攤飽到不行，真的無法吃下任何食物，所以只有以飲品為主，對服務人員也有點不好意思。

雖然過程算是很舒適，空間跟美景都沒話說，但是隔壁的客人，男的西裝筆挺，女的亮麗小洋裝，全部看起來都很體面。但不確定是婚宴後的第二攤還是開派對，幾乎都是邊喝邊玩遊戲，隨著時間經過，酒也越喝越多，聲音也越來越大，後來陸續打破了好幾個杯子（過程中一直聽到玻璃摔碎在地面的聲音）。

後來可能玩開了，開始追逐以及一群男生扛起單男，再搬立食用的桌子過來阿魯巴（一種將男生橫倒扛起，將男生大腿打開，大力頂撞長條柱物的遊戲）過程相互嘻鬧、大聲喧嘩。

說真的，玩什麼遊戲以及用什麼物品攻擊誰，我一點都不在乎，只是在玩鬧的過程中，音量跟行為我覺得已經打擾到其他客人，我朋友也被嚇到，因為真的幾乎是在我們旁邊做這些事情，行為跟音量都已經破壞這美好的空間，後來還麻煩服務人員幫我們換位置

打破玻璃器皿以及扛桌子跟追逐、音量過大等行為，雖已影響其他客人，我個人也覺得造成服務人員的困擾，但是過程中並無任何人出面阻止，連服務人員也沒有勸阻，我覺得很可惜，畢竟是一個算高檔的場合，並不是熱炒店，有點脫序的行為讓場面有點難看，但是就這樣放任，說真的，對於整體體驗的過程就扣分了....

不過基於還是有留下好印象，所以還是針對優缺點大概分析一下：

優點：

1. 調酒賣相好味道也棒
2. 夜景非常棒
3. 服務品質好
4. 空間舒適悠閒
5. 內熱鬧外安靜
6. 酒單種類多
7. 適合約會或談心
8. 離市區算是非常近
9. 附近還有捷運可抵達

缺點：

1. 戶外座位需看天氣
2. 椅子不是很好坐

裡面的座位放著音樂，音量有點大，如果想要安靜聊天可能要選外面座位，只是外面風大，有要去的人記得帶件外套會比較適合。但是某些客人會在位置上抽煙，要有吸二手煙的心理準備，因為酒吧在這方面好像是默許的行為，並無任何人勸阻。

而沙發區的位置，椅子的深度我覺得坐起來有點累，很像沙發躺椅，坐的時候無法靠到背，要坐很裡面，不然就是要盤腿，或是某些女生是橫坐在位置上，不算是舒適的椅子。

消費可以使用現金以及信用卡支付，這點還算是方便。該飯店也有停車場，但當天未使用所以不確定抵扣方式以及停車費用。","The visit time was at 10 o'clock on Saturday night. In fact, the peak time of dining has been passed, but it just enters the peak of watching night views, renewal, and relaxing mood to find a place to chat. Outside seats.

After waiting for the service personnel to confirm the reception area, the low consumption of a person is $ 1000 + 10%, which is different from the original official website and many webpage materials. Most of them are marked $ 500 + 10%. Hall of holidays just have Halloween activities. In short, the consumption model to enter is the above [$ 1000 + 10%] and it is not a personal table, but a table with others. If it is acceptable, we will start billing and will not directly force acceptance.

After looking at the seat, in fact, the table should be said to be sitting on the same block, the outside wind is large + open space. In fact, there will be no parallel feel. Friends can accept. The overall process is comfortable.

Although the price method is different from the beginning of understanding, it is not low consumption when watching a lot of holiday time to see night views on high -rise buildings, so there is no big gap in my heart, and the space is comfortable and the night view is beautiful. I think the biggest is the biggest. Attraction and selling point.

Originally, there was an inquiry about the reservation. The indoor can be reached, but the number of seats is small, and it will be full. There is another reservation mode, but the low consumption seems to be 8,000 (the actual amount is forgotten). If there are more people together, there are more people together. Sorting is actually okay.

Seeing this, some people may feel too high, but to be honest, one provides convenient transportation + beautiful night view + open seat + delicious bartending (no alcoholic tone) + simple meal + no Under the various conditions of time limit, I actually don't think this consumption model is not too much.And it ’s been long for a long time. I feel that the wind is too strong and feels too cold. You can also change to the inside (but must have a vacant position) and will not increase the price.

I think the wine list is also very rich. Whether men and women love all kinds of wine, they should be satisfied here. Here it provides special flaws, original cocktails, bubble cocktails, low alcoholic cocktails, no alcoholic cocktails, whiskey, softness Drinks (tea, coffee, soda), etc.

Some of the meals of the wine include oysters, bacon, fruit, fried sweet potatoes, ham cheese balls, chicken wings, salads, skewers, loquat, cold meat plates, etc.

Actually I drank several cups of special drinks. Seriously, I personally feel that it is delicious, and the service is good, very polite and fast. It is full of smiles at any time. Personally, the service is full, and the service is not neglect at all. In such a great space, it can have a good experience. It is really not easy.And we are more comfortable to enjoy drinks and beautiful scenery. There are no meals, but in the process, the service staff should be worried that we have not ordered to pay a low disappearance. Adding drinks and meals, because in fact, it is not enough to be full in the last stall, and I really ca n’t eat any food, so only be drinks, and I am a little embarrassed by the service staff.

Although the process is very comfortable, there is nothing to say in space and beauty, but the guests next door, the man's suit, the beautiful and beautiful dress, all look decent.But I'm not sure that the second stall after the wedding banquet is still a party. Almost all of them play games while drinking. Over time, the more wine is drinking, and the sound is getting louder. Later, several cups were broken. During the process, the sound of the glass was broken on the ground).

Later, I might have played, and began to chase and a group of boys to carry a single man, and then moved the tabletable table to Aruba (a game that put boys horizontally, open the boy's thigh, and hit the long pillar. The process was making trouble and loud noise.

Seriously, I don't care what the game and what items are used for attacking, but in the process of playing, I think the volume and behavior have disturbed other guests, and my friend is also scared, because it is almost almost almost the almost Do these things next to us, the behavior and volume have destroyed this beautiful space. Later, it was troublesome to help us change the position.

Breaking the glass utensils, carrying the table and chasing, and excessive volume, although it has affected other guests, I personally feel that the service staff is troubled, but there is no one to stop anyone in the process. It is a pity that after all, it is a high -end occasion, not a hot -fried shop. A little bit of behavior makes the scene a bit ugly, but just let it go, seriously, the process of the overall experience is deducted ....

However, it is still a good impression, so the advantages and disadvantages are probably analyzed:

advantage:

1. The taste of bartending and selling is also good
2. The night scene is great
3. Good service quality
4. Separate and leisurely
5. Inner lively and quiet
6. There are many types of wine
7. Suitable for dating or talking
8. It is very close to the urban area
9. There are also MRT to reach nearby

shortcoming:

1. Outdoor seats need to see the weather
2. The chair is not very easy to sit

The seats inside are music, and the volume is a bit large. If you want to chat quietly, you may choose the outside seat, but the outside is strong. Some people who want to go are more suitable to bring a jacket.However, some guests will smoke in their positions and have the psychological preparation of second -hand smoke, because the bar seems to be acquiesced in this regard, and no one has dissuaded.

In the position of the sofa area, I think the depth of the chair is a bit tired. It is very similar to the sofa lounge chair. I can't lean on the back when I sit. It is not a comfortable chair.

Consumption can be paid using cash and credit cards, which is still convenient.The hotel also has parking lots, but it is not used that day, so it is not sure of deducting methods and parking costs."
"用餐時間：2020.07.25
故意訂位在傍晚時去的，可拍到夕陽到了夜晚又有夜景欣賞，雖然靠窗區無法指定，但餐廳有盡力安排非常開心！服務生似乎都訓練有素，問酒單都可以介紹的很詳細。當天點了街頭串燒，蒜頭炸得很酥像在吃餅乾，串燒就普通，戰斧豬排中間還帶點粉紅色，處理得很好讓我想起地獄廚房XD，只可惜沒甚麼味道...有點失望。調酒2杯都不錯，不會像外面的酒吧冰塊一堆酒味很淡，紅酒第2杯半價就算茫了也還是要續！XD
總結氣氛100分餐點及格邊緣，下次會想帶朋友去喝酒放鬆欣賞美景但不會用餐。","Meal time: 2020.07.25
The deliberate reservation was going in the evening, but when the sunset was taken until the night, there was night scene appreciation. Although the window area could not be specified, the restaurant had tried to arrange very happy!The waiters seem to be well -trained, and the wine list can be introduced in detail.On the same day, I ordered the street skewers. The garlic was fried very crispy like eating biscuits. The skewers were ordinary. There was a pink in the middle of the Tomahawk pork chop, which made me remind me of the hell kitchen XD, but unfortunately there was no taste ... A little disappointed.The 2 cups of bartending are good. It will not be like a bunch of ice cubes outside the bar outside. The second cup of red wine is still continued even if it is vast!XD
Summarize the atmosphere of 100 points and the edge of the grid. Next time, you will want to take friends to drink and relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery."
這一顆星是給風景的，這間餐廳一顆星都不值得給，第一次花這麼多錢吃到這麼劣質的食物，濃湯口感奇特，馬鈴薯泥十分黏稠，我嚴重懷疑是用果汁機打出來的，龍蝦不新鮮，有腥臭味，又死鹹，烤雞也是鹹到吐，烤蔥也完全咬不動，我真的無法理解這間餐廳是如果持續營業的，有機會的話，應該請衛生局前來稽查一下，真的沒吃過這麼腥的龍蝦。,"This star is given to the scenery. This restaurant is not worth it. For the first time, spend so much money to eat such inferior food, the thick soup is strange, and the potato puree is very sticky. I seriously suspect that I use fruit juice. The lobster is not fresh, the lobster is smelling, and the salty is salty. The grilled chicken is also salty, and the roasted shallots can't be bitten at all. I should ask the Health Bureau to come to check, I really haven't eaten such a fishy lobster."
這天我坐在吧台高腳椅的位子，能與調酒師近距離的互動，對酒的品牌喜好或是口感，調酒師都不吝為我解說及推薦，這天我和內人度過了非常愉快的夜晚！,"On this day, I sat at the position of the high chair of the bar, which can interact closely with the bartender. I like the brand's preferences or taste. The bartender will explain and recommend it for me. A very happy night!"

But the food is very standard and delicate. The previous dish is scallops. It is very soft and tender with the main meal.

Views outside can see the entire inner lake. The weather is good and it should be beautiful ~"
公司尾牙聚餐，調酒還行，但個人覺得尾牙菜單不太好吃，建議直接點菜單上的其他餐點。,"The company's tail dinner is okay, but I personally feel that the tail menu is not delicious. It is recommended to order other meals on the menu directly."

雖然是萬豪餐廳初體驗，但親切細心的服務態度，著實讓我感到他們對客戶需求的用心程度，由於服務生忙碌的關係沒有提醒我們龍蝦麵條的軟硬度因此做了我們不喜歡的口感，但反應後（應該是主管吧？）立即幫我們換了一份新的餐點來，這種站在顧客的立場想而且不計成本的餐廳跟服務態度，我很欽佩，難怪雖然價格不便宜生意還是如此好👍其他服務人員也一直詢問是否滿意，我能夠體諒服務員點錯2次餐，下次絕對會再訪，戶外的夜景很美，看再久也不厭倦，再次感謝20樓餐廳的所有服務人員，尤其是當下立馬幫我換另一份龍蝦麵的（主管？）真心推薦好吃的龍蝦麵喔🦞🍝🈵謝謝,"Although it is the first experience of the Marriott Restaurant, the intimate and careful service attitude really makes me feel the degree of intention of their customer needs. Because the waiter's busy relationship does not remind us of the hardness of our lobster noodles, we do not like the taste. But after the response (should it be the supervisor?) Immediately helped us change a new meal. This kind of restaurant and service attitude of the restaurant that stands from the customer and regardless of cost. Still so good 👍 Other service personnel have been asking whether they are satisfied. I can be considerate of the waiter to order the meal 2 times. I will definitely visit it next time. The outdoor night view is beautiful. Personnel, especially now, immediately help me change another lobster noodle (supervisor?) I really recommend delicious lobster noodles. Thank you"
"位於大直萬豪酒店的20樓，燈光美氣氛佳，很適合情侶來慶祝節日約會。
晚餐最後點餐時間是9：30，之後開始都是BAR。
用餐的空檔不妨走到到室外觀景平台觀賞夜景，視野很好可以將松山機場的飛機起降、101大樓、台北的夜景盡收眼底。
餐點很美味，這次主餐的部分點了海陸盤，原本還要再點一份肋眼，但服務人員很貼心，覺得份量會太多，建議我們後續胃還有空間的話再加點。
龍蝦十分Q彈吃的很滿足，牛排軟嫩香氣十足，一海一陸絕配，口感更提升不會太單調。
唯二美中不足就是桌子有一點不平會小晃動，服務員來墊完桌腳好多了。另一點是請服務人員提供海鹽，服務員幫我們灑在盤子的邊邊，結果可能是海鹽罐底部沒有鎖好，服務員邊灑在邊邊，另一邊的鹽也豪爽的漏到我們的牛排上，我們看到後趕緊跟服務員說，他才發現並趕緊將整盤主餐端到後面處理（可能就是把牛排上的鹽刮掉吧）再端回來給我們，以致有一部分比較鹹，幸好友人很可以吃鹹⋯
我們一路待到凌晨才離開，最後的美酒配上美麗夜景，雖然價格不便宜但還蠻值得的。","It is located on the 20th floor of the Dazhi Marriott Hotel. The lights are beautiful, which is very suitable for couples to celebrate holiday dating.
The last time of ordering at dinner was 9:30, and then BAR began to start.
The gap of the meal may wish to go to the outdoor view platform to watch the night view. If you have a good vision, you can see the aircraft of Songshan Airport, the night view of the 101 building, and Taipei.
The meal is very delicious. This time, the main meal was ordered to order the sea and land. Originally, I had to order another rib, but the service staff was very intimate and felt that there would be too much portion. It is recommended that we have some stomach and space.
The lobster is very satisfied. The steak is soft and tender, and the sea and land are perfect. The taste is not too monotonous.
The disadvantage of the two beauty is that the table is a little bit uneven, and the waiter is much better to finish the table.The other point is to ask the service staff to provide sea salt. The waiter helps us spill on the edge of the plate. As a result, the bottom of the sea salt tank may not be locked. When we saw it, I quickly told the waiter that he found out and quickly handed the whole main meal to the back (probably scrape the salt on the steak) and brought it back to us. Can eat salty ...
We stayed all the way to leave in the early morning, and the last wine was matched with a beautiful night view. Although the price was not cheap, it was quite worth it."
來過生日。牛小排不錯，牛肋眼像在美國自己到超商買了USD Prime 回家直火烤，牛油脂焦香好吃。套餐魚好吃，甜點也不錯。調酒還行,"Birthday.Niu Xiaoping is good, the beef rib eyes bought USD Prime in the United States to go home and go home for a straight fire. The butter fat is delicious.The set fish is delicious and the dessert is also good.Bartending is OK"

ᴏɴᴇ ᴏғ ᴍʏ ғᴀᴠ ʙᴀʀ ɪɴ ᴛᴀɪᴘᴇɪ 🍸

之前在動態有很多人詢問的 @inges_taipei
是台北我很喜歡的酒吧之一。

位於大直萬豪酒店20F的 Inge’s,
是台北少數的高空酒吧，
除了各式調酒之外也有提供正餐的餐點。

這次我們點了龍蝦海膽麵、羅西尼牛排跟漁夫海鮮湯，
每一道口味都不錯，
份量也蠻大的，
一道菜適合2人以上一起享用。

來到 Inge’s, 有種偽出國的氛圍，
高樓的景致環繞，
白天跟晚上有著不一樣的感覺，
吃完晚餐喝點小酒，
在到戶外吹吹風看看夜景，
感到特別舒心遼闊呢！

噢～ 說到喜愛的酒吧！
當然不能忘了介紹他們的酒類，
名列世界餐飲評鑑 50 Best Discovery 的推薦酒吧，
酒款分為三大類，
獨家比例的特調烈酒、風味調酒跟珍藏經典紅白酒。

特別喜歡這款調酒，
Inge’s Tea Time（圖6），
以琴酒為基底的調酒，
結合了紫蘇、紅茶、蒔蘿和水果，
喝起來非常清爽又特別，
完全不像在喝酒，
個人覺得女生應該都會愛 ☺️

服務面覺得有時候忙的時候來，
外面領檯服務不是很友善（少一顆星的理由），
但裡面的侍酒跟服務生態度都很好也很貼心，
此次同行有孕婦還幫我們把食物加熱至全熟，
拍照的時候幫我們打光，
服務很周到細心！","# @ @Arielhsu1221

@In_taipei, which had many people asked in dynamics before
It is one of the bars I like in Taipei.

Located at Inge ’s at 20F, Dazhi Marriott Hotel,
It is one of the few high -altitude bars in Taipei,
In addition to all kinds of bartending, there are also meals that provide meals.

This time we ordered lobster sea urchin noodles, Rosini steak and fisherman seafood soup,
Every taste is good,
The portion is also quite large,
A dish is suitable for more than 2 people to enjoy together.

When you come to Inge ’s, there is a kind of atmosphere of pseudo -abroad,
Surrounded by the scenery of the high -rise building,
During the day, it feels different from night,
After dinner, drink a little wine,
Look at the night view when you go outdoors,
I feel particularly comfortable!

Oh ~ Speaking of a favorite bar!
Of course, you must not forget to introduce their alcohol,
The recommendation bar of the World Catering Review 50 Best Discovery,
The wine is divided into three categories,
Exclusive proportion of special spirits, flavors, bartending and treasured classic red liquor.

I especially like this bartender,
Inge ’s Tea Time (Figure 6),
Bart -up based on piano wine,
Combined with perilla, black tea, dill and fruits,
It is very refreshing and special,
It's not like drinking at all,
Personally, girls should love 生️

The service surface feels sometimes when you are busy,
Linking to Taiwan is not very friendly (a reason for one star),
But the alcoholic and service ecosystem inside is very good and intimate.
This time, there are pregnant women who also help us to heat the food to all cooked.
Help us shine when taking pictures,
The service is very careful!"
"服務很好，但是杯墊的品質有待加強。餐點份量也有待加強。

The service is good. The coasters need to be improved, the way of the soaking water isn’t great and become sticking with the glasses.
The portion of the snack are not enough.","The service is good, but the quality of the coaster needs to be strengthened.The amount of meals also needs to be strengthened.

The service is good. The coasters need to be improved, the way of the soaking water is n’t the great and become sticking with the glasses.
The portion of the snack are not enough."
調酒味道都不錯，要喝濃一點就選琴酒或Martini。夜晚稍微有點夜店的感覺，服務人員不太會去干涉其他桌客人（喝醉？）影響不認識桌客人的狀況。,"The taste of bartending is good. If you want to drink a little more, choose piano wine or Martini.A little nightclub at night, the service staff does not interfere with other table guests (drunk?) The situation of not knowing the table guests."
"偏貴 買氣氛的
服務人員服務非常優秀 會用真心推薦招牌餐點
主餐牛小排很棒 本日最優
配菜的玉米跟菇味道也不錯
下酒菜薯格格第一名
其他下酒菜就水準之下 例如薯條 炸豆腐 牛肉串 實在普通貴又不優

整體來說以CP值而言比較不會列入再訪","Poly -expensive buying atmosphere
The service staff service is very good, and the signature meal is really recommended.
The main meal cattle is great today, the best today
The corn and mushrooms of the side dishes are also good
Laijiu, sweet potato grid first place
Other wine and vegetables are under standard. For example, fried fried tofu beef skewers are really expensive and not good

Overall, it is not included in the re -visit in terms of CP value"
"這間餐廳身藏於大直很有名的萬豪酒店裡，推薦想吃美食、喝調酒、看夜景的你
非常推薦這裡的龍蝦及牛排，龍蝦彈牙味道好吃，是這裡主廚特製才有的味道，帶有一點焦香味，讓我非常喜歡，不用過多的調味，能吃到龍蝦本身的鮮甜味，非常棒！
牛排油脂和肉的比例很好，搭配海鹽相當讚，油脂香在口中散發出來，讓人非常enjoy!牛排的份量也很多，可以吃得很滿足！
這裡10點轉換成酒Bar模式（18歲以下就禁止進入了，提醒有帶18歲以下的各位要留意），也會有駐點DJ播放EDM，搭配調酒相當有氣氛，而此位於20樓，夜景相當漂亮，可以一覽台北市區的夜景，不時還可以看到松山機場的飛機起降，非常適合想看夜景喝上一杯調酒又找不到地方的人，手上一杯調酒，享受這夜晚！","This restaurant is hidden in the famous Marriott Hotel in Dazhi. It is recommended that you want to eat food, drink alcohol, and watch the night view.
It is highly recommended here the lobster and steak. The lobster has a delicious flavor. It is the taste of the chef here. It has a little scorching flavor. It makes me like it very much. It tastes great!
The proportion of steak fats and meat is very good. It is quite praised with sea salt. The oil fragrance is emitted in the mouth, which makes people very enjoy! The steak also has a lot of portion, and it can be satisfied!
Here is 10 o'clock to convert to wine BAR mode (prohibited to enter under 18 years of age, remind that you should pay attention to everyone under 18 years old), and there will be DJs to play EDM in the station, which is quite atmospheric with bartending. This is located on the 20th floor. The night view is quite beautiful. You can see the night view of the city of Taipei. From time to time, you can also see the take -off and landing of Songshan Airport. It is very suitable for those who want to see the night view and drink a cup of bartending and can not find a place. That night!"
"牛排和龍蝦麵都好好吃！ 湯品和甜點一般般。
酒類 紅白酒ok,但精選特調不開放點選，因為有客座調酒師，所以必須得點ㄧset3杯的客座調酒。 因為在點酒前完全無人告知客座調酒活動，所以對於只能點客座 不能點一般精選的規則一無所知，點酒中詢問服務生，也得到強硬的回答「這就是活動的規定」「先點完客座調酒 才開放一般特調」，但對於我們詢問詳細 規則 又答不出來， 點完客座set後，要再點一般特調 服務生也是吱吱嗚嗚，說要先問調酒師能不能調？！ 種種讓用餐體驗大打折扣。 我們一行人平均每人消費金額是3000-4000，總論CP值低。","Steak and lobster noodles are delicious!The soup and dessert are the same.
The wine red and white wine is OK, but the selected special tone is not open. Because of the guest bartender, it must be a little bit of SET3 cup of guest bartender.Because no one informs the guest bartending activities before ordering wine, I know nothing about the rules that can only be ordered or not to order the general selection. Ask the waiter in the wine, and get a tough answer ""This is the regulation of the event. """" First order the passenger bartender before it is open, "", but we can't answer the detailed rules for us. After ordering the visitor SET, it is also squeak when you order the general special waiter. Can the bartender be adjusted?IntersectionAll kinds of meal experience are greatly reduced.The average consumption amount per person per person is 3000-4000, and the total CP value is low."
"大推老饕牛排、龍蝦麵、干貝
都非常美味好吃，店員推薦的紅酒也帶果香微甜非常搭配，甜點也好吃但可惜品項有點少
景就不用說了～
2200後還有Dj時間再變身酒吧
值得再回訪","Push old steak, lobster noodles, scallops
They are all delicious and delicious. The red wine recommended by the clerk is also very sweet and sweet, and the dessert is also delicious, but unfortunately it is a bit less product.
Needless to say, Jing Jing ~
After 2200, there is DJ time to turn into a bar again
It is worth visiting"
完美的餐點成就完美的生日💓,Perfect meals achieve the perfect birthday 💓
餐點出乎意料之外的美味，且份量十足，絕對不會吃不飽，個人建議單點餐點即可，搭配多種調酒，以及極佳的店內氣氛以及戶外夜景，非常值得！,"The meal is unexpectedly delicious, and the portion is full. It will never be enough to eat. Personally, you can order a meal, with a variety of bartending, as well as the excellent atmosphere and outdoor night view, it is worth it!"
"餐點價位較高些，但味覺、視覺與服務都很值得，尤其外面超大露台望出去寬闊的台北景象，遠從台北新光站前，松山機場、台北101、微風南山，往東一路直到南港車站、中國信託金融園區等等，視野一整個舒坦！
黃昏到晚間、越夜越美麗，前來露台賞景喝酒聊天的人也越多，氣氛就是無敵！","The price of meals is higher, but the taste, vision, and service are worthy of it. Especially the large terrace outside the outside view of the wide Taipei scene is far away from Taipei Xinguang Station, Songshan Airport, Taipei 101, Breeze Nanshan, to East Road to Nangang Station until Nangang Station , China Trust Financial Park, etc., the whole vision is comfortable!
The more beautiful to the night, the more beautiful, the more people who come to the terrace to enjoy the scenery and drink, and the atmosphere is invincible!"
訂位時有告知是慶生，但沒有收到任何慶祝活動。紅酒單上種類繁多，但是我們點了兩瓶都賣完了，到第三瓶才有貨。餐點的價位偏高，我們單點春雞和羊排，份量蠻小，女生吃都不夠，單點前菜沒有肉類，想點前菜也沒得選。,"When booked a place, I was notified to celebrate his birthday, but no celebration was received.There are many types of red wine, but we ordered two bottles to sell them. Only the third bottle is available.The price of the meal is high. We order spring chicken and lamb chops. The portion is quite small. The girls are not enough to eat. There is no meat in the front dish."
本以為是吃view的高空酒吧而已，沒想到調酒很令人驚艷耶，酒的平衡做得非常好！非常喜歡招牌Inge’s Tea Time，有我喜歡的紫蘇與紅茶的風味～ 朋友點的Impressionism把芝麻油與九層塔很好地融合在一起，也很令人驚奇！整體而言會是想再度造訪的酒吧喔～,"I thought it was just a high -altitude bar for View. I didn't expect bartending to be amazing. The balance of wine was very good!I really like the signature Inge ’s Tea Time. I have the flavor of my favorite perilla and black tea ~ IMPRESSIONISM’ s Impressionism is very amazing to combine sesame oil with the nine -layer tower, which is also amazing!Overall, it will be a bar you want to visit again ~"
"餐點份量足夠可以點了大家分著吃，除了經典調酒之外也有許多特色調酒。
餐廳是輕鬆的爵士氛圍，外面有露天座位區可以看夜景。","The amount of meals is enough to order everyone to eat. In addition to classic bartending, there are many specialty bartending.
The restaurant is a relaxed jazz atmosphere, and there is an open -air seat area to see the night view."
跟公司同事聚餐，單人3000的套餐，最推薦的就是牛小排，大概是吃過最軟嫩的牛小排，幾乎沒筋而且多汁，熟度雖是五分熟但卻不會太生不好咬，本餐最大亮點，餐廳外面還有平台可以拍照看風景，但這個價位可能主要是吃場地跟位置，有點超過我對食材的理解,"Gel with colleagues in the company. The 3000 set meal, the most recommended is Niu Xiao Pai. It is probably the softest and tender Niu Xiaopan. It has almost no tendons and juicy. It ’s not easy to bite. The biggest highlight of this meal. There is also a platform outside the restaurant to take pictures to see the scenery, but this price may be mainly to eat the site and location, which is more than my understanding of the ingredients."
超級推薦。已經很久沒吃到這好吃的餐點。每道菜都讓我很驚豔。景色超美。本來還在想要要不要上來用餐。怕雷到。結果上來後花了5千多塊，但覺得超值得。因為餐點太美味。服務超好。景色也太美了。超推薦大家一定要來。,"Super recommended.I haven't eaten this delicious meal for a long time.Every dish made me amazing.The scenery is super beautiful.I was still wanting to come up for dining.Afraid of thunder.It took more than 5,000 yuan after it came up, but it was super worth it.Because the meal is too delicious.The service is super good.The scenery is too beautiful.I recommend that everyone must come."
"台北萬豪酒店20樓的餐酒館
一進到餐廳就可以看到戶外廣闊的風景，非常賞心悅目！
這次用餐主要是喝酒，餐點部分21:30後就不供應，如要用餐可能要注意一下
酒的部分水準不錯，不輸一些東區知名的酒吧，也讓一直覺得飯店酒吧都偏普通的我，留下深刻印象
當天因為有幫朋友慶生，不小心錯過21:30的最後點餐時間，後來服務員很貼心的詢問還有一個瑪芬蛋糕，可以招待給我們，感謝他們的幫忙，讓我們順利幫朋友慶生，也因此後續若有機會，一定會再去一次～","Dining and tavern on the 20th floor of Taipei Marriott Hotel
As soon as you enter the restaurant, you can see the broad scenery of the outdoor, very pleasing to the eye!
This time, the meal is mainly to drink, and the meal will not be supplied after 21:30. If you want to eat, you may pay attention to it
The level of the wine is good. Do not lose some well -known bars in the Eastern District. It also makes me who always feel that the restaurant bar is ordinary, leaving a deep impression.
On the same day, because I helped my friends to celebrate his birthday, I accidentally missed the last order time at 21:30. Later, the waiter asked very intimately that there was a Moved cake that could be enrolled to us. Thank you for helping our friends to celebrate the birth. So if you have a chance in the future, you will definitely go again ~"
"俯瞰台北夜景以及夕陽西下美景！讓人有著非常輕鬆愜意美食空間。

The restaurant on the 20th floor is beautiful night view and a relaxed atmosphere!"
風景無敵，調酒對我來說有點甜，食材新鮮，不過以這個價錢，精緻度可以提升，不過景色還是重點！,"The scenery is invincible, and the bartender is a bit sweet for me. The ingredients are fresh, but at this price, the exquisiteness can be improved, but the scenery is still the point!"

料理菜色同照片還不錯，在這可以看到台北的夜景，很漂亮！ 蠻適合約會去，主菜他們是走炭烤的方式，會有一層黑黑的焦碳味....好吃是好吃，如果你是養身人，可能會被嚇到。 服務普通。 空間寬敞，朋友聚餐也不錯！,"The dishes are good and the photos are good.

"在一開始要求客人諸多規定，卻沒有盡到擁有這樣「規定」的店家該有的水準與服務，水要錢就算了，這個國外也是通則，但在一開始點餐時連問都沒問客人要不要點水喝，請問我們是會通靈嗎^_^;？

更別提一開始說沒有位子把我們放在ㄇ字型沙發區（緊鄰著他們餐廳與吧台的後台區，超像候位區，感受很差）並且說若有空位可以幫我們換位子，但當有真的「空位」時，詢問卻說有訂位（嗯？剛剛明明聽到你們說可以帶位耶🥺原來是國王的客人嗎😊）

就不用再說從頭到尾詢問時語氣都超差請問這真的該是50 best Discovery 該有的服務水準嗎？？？？哈囉是把台北其他酒吧當馬鈴薯喔🥔

擁有這麼高的評價卻不能將這樣的品質顧好，只能說很可惜，真的辜負了這麼一片美好的景致耶🤗

喔而且低消500，到底哪裡值得我掏錢花500買這個爛服務（還有服務費喔氣氣氣氣氣）

罪責加一：沒有附杯墊，水一直亂噴，我們還要自己自製杯墊，我還以為我在麥當勞🥺

調酒很普通","At the beginning, the guests were required to have many regulations, but they did not fulfill the standards and services that the stores that had such ""regulations"". Do you want to drink water, do we be psychic?^_^;?

Not to mention that at first, there is no seat to put us in the sofa area of ​​the font (close to the background area of ​​their restaurant and bar, super like waiting area, feeling poor) and say that if there is a vacant position, it can help us change the place, but When there is a real ""empty position"", the inquiry says there is a reservation (huh? Just hearing you that you can bring the position as the king's guest)?)

Needless to say, when asked from beginning to end, tone is too bad. Is this really the service level of 50 Best Discovery?IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionHarbin is to treat other bars in Taipei as potatoes.

With such a high evaluation, you can't take care of such quality. It can only be said that it is a pity. I really live up to such a beautiful scenery

Oh and low 500, where is it worth paying for 500 to buy this bad service (and the service fee, the gas and gas)

Crime and one: No coin is attached, and the water has been sprayed randomly. We have to make my own coasters. I thought I was in McDonald's

Blooming is very ordinary"
龍蝦新鮮，牛排好吃，餐卷的雙人套餐兩個人夠吃，還不錯。調酒很喜歡，是請服務生推薦的。,"The lobster is fresh, the steak is delicious, and the two -person packets of the rolled rolls are enough to eat, which is not bad.I like bartending, I ask the waiter to recommend it."

本來以為只是個酒吧，沒想到還有吃的🥺🥺餐點的部分從一開始的前菜到甜點都不錯👍前菜是冰淇淋下面有一圈起士，旁邊有薄薄的那種肉乾加上水果，挺微妙的組合，擺盤也很厲害～～有一道菜上面放了四個貝殼，下面一堆石頭，只有一個貝殼上面有鮑魚，旁邊都是醬或配料，挺有創意的不得不說😂😂主餐的部分，龍蝦好吃到我都把它分解了，如果上面有加焗烤會更讚！牛排非常的嫩又有嚼勁，就算五分熟感覺也不會乾硬喔，豬排吃起來口感很Q彈，配著旁邊的蘋果一起吃太完美了～～甜點一開始看到覺得很普通，但吃下去才知道完全不一樣，外面包著薄薄巧克力，裡面不知道加了什麼，吃起來不會太甜但又有甜滋滋的滋味，壽星來的話有招待小小的蛋糕，打電話先來跟他們說蛋糕上還會寫上名字喔😏整體就是個燈光美氣氛佳的地方！ …,"I thought it was just a bar. I did not expect that there was a meal that I had eaten from the beginning to the previous dishes to the dessert.

For the main meal, the lobster is delicious, and I will decompose it.The steak is very tender and chewy. Even if the five points are cooked, it will not be dry. The pork chop tastes very Q bombs. It is perfect to eat it with the apple next to the apple. But I know that it is completely different. There is a thin chocolate that is bread outside. I don’t know what to add. It will not taste too sweet but has a sweet taste. Let's tell them to tell them that the name will be written on the cake.Mowing"
"萬豪自營的餐廳服務我覺得都很好，Inge’s view好、氣氛好（但室內好吵）、菜也好，吃完去露台吹風看夜景，覺得療癒♥️
烤魚好好吃gosh!套餐對女生來說份量頗多，建議單點主食（如烤魚）再加一份套餐💯 …","I think Marriott's self -employed restaurant service is very good. INGE ’s View is good, the atmosphere is good (but the room is noisy), and the dishes are good.
The grilled fish is delicious! The package is quite large for girls. It is recommended to order a single staple food (such as grilled fish) plus a package 💯 ..."
餐點特推肋眼牛排，如有特殊日子強烈建議到inges。無敵夜景，氣氛相當好。酒類選擇性多，每個人都可以選到喜歡的口味。10點後有DJ放歌，瞬間歡樂起來，一定會再來,"Special push -ribs -eye steak, if you have a special day, it is strongly recommended to go to INGES.Invincible night view, the atmosphere is quite good.There are many alcohol selection, and everyone can choose the taste of favorite.After 10 o'clock, there will be dj to play songs, and you will come again in an instant, and you will definitely come again"
地點很方便的飯店，只需步行約5-7分鐘即到捷運劍南站。生意非常好，假日容易客滿，建議要先預約，早上用餐也避開人潮眾多的時候,"The restaurant where the location is very convenient, just walk for about 5-7 minutes to go to the MRT Jiannan Station.The business is very good, and the holidays are easy to be full. It is recommended to make an appointment first."
"百萬夜景 東西吃起來還可以
牛排比較特別 咬下去有焦香
海鮮吃起來還好","Millions of night views are okay
The steak is particularly bite and there is a scorching fragrance
Seafood tastes okay"
"氣氛五分、餐點四分、調酒三分。
Night view 從大直遠眺台北市區，視野好，非常漂亮。店內氣氛如同香港曼谷sky bar，浪漫適合約會。$1800套餐的紐約客牛排外皮烤得酥脆，內裡多汁，好吃！可惜5分卻像是7分，過熟了。調酒很普通，不推。","The atmosphere, four -point meal, three -pointers.
Night View overlooks the city of Taipei from Dazhi, with a good vision and very beautiful.The atmosphere in the store is like Sky Bar, Hong Kong, which is suitable for dating.The $ 1800 set of New York guest cattle steak skin is crispy, juicy inside, delicious!Unfortunately, 5 points are like 7 points, which is too familiar.The bartender is very ordinary, not pushing."
鬆綁酥脆剛好，海鮮披薩滿好吃，但份量太少，魚子醬洋芋超好吃，餐廳位於20樓風景優美，價位很高，服務人員倒水有待加強，灑的倒處都是,"The loosening is just crispy, the seafood pizza is delicious, but the portion is too small. The caviar potato is super delicious. The restaurant is located on the 20th floor of the scenery and the price is very high."
"+我們點的海陸雙拼好吃! 老婆說比微風南山的Smith & Wollensky好吃。本人是認為兩邊都好吃。
+好停車
+夜景美無障礙物
+服務好態度好語氣好
+氣氛佳適合約會
-唯一雞蛋裡挑骨頭的挑剔的是隔壁的全聯總部的燈很礙眼，晚上照相時要避開它，但是這不是餐廳可以控制的哈哈","+Our order is delicious! Wife said that it is more delicious than Smith & Wollensky from Breeze Nanshan.I think it is delicious on both sides.
+Good parking
+Night scene beauty without hindrance
+Good service, good, good, good, good
+The atmosphere is good for dating
-The only picky bone in the eggs is that the lights of the full -headed headquarters next door are very obstructive. You need to avoid it when taking pictures at night, but this is not the restaurant that can be controlled. Haha"
"餐點精緻好吃
牛排烤得十分恰當與美味
龍蝦義大利麵味道濃郁，龍蝦的份量也很多

整體分量足夠，點套餐的話如果兩人只點一份還會很貼心幫忙分兩份
六點之前到的話還可以先來個Happy hour
價格合理，絕美的風景又加了不少分，連兩週來報到了!","The meals are delicate and delicious
The steak is very proper and delicious
Lobster's Italian faces have a strong taste, and the amount of lobster is also a lot

The overall weight is sufficient.
If you arrive before six o'clock
The price is reasonable, the beautiful scenery has added a lot of points, and it has been reported for two weeks!"
視野很棒，可以直接看到台北101，側面也可以看到美麗華摩天輪。,"The field of vision is great, you can see Taipei 101 directly, and you can also see the beautiful Hua Ferris wheel on the side."
一訪時還慶祝結婚週年，東西還不錯但稍貴，二訪時特地來喝調酒，點了三杯有兩杯好喝，外面景色很美，晚上在外面喝酒看夜景很不錯～,"At the time of the visit, I also celebrated the anniversary of the marriage. The things were good but slightly more expensive. During the second visit, I came to drink alcohol. I ordered three cups to have two cups. The outside scene was beautiful."
東西不好吃，景色也不明亮，跟曼谷夜景比真的差很多⋯開瓶裝水也不問有沒有需要就直接開瓶之後再跟你收費很扯，相對於也在附近的美福酒店的lounge bar就非常的好！,"The stuff is not delicious, and the scenery is not bright. It is much worse than the night view of Bangkok. When the bottle is opened, it does not ask if there is any need to open the bottle and then charge it with you. Lounge Bar is very good!"
牛排先是太生，反應後有回烤但變成好多肥肉，甜點沒有特別出色，夜景也還好,"The steak is too raw first. After the reaction, there are many fatty meat. The dessert is not particularly good. The night scene is okay."

Lobster is very big, there are many, and the taste of shrimp sauce and shrimp is also very strong.

The only thing that is slightly not enough is that the toilet is so far XD"
鳥瞰台北夜景 約會好選擇,Bird's view of Taipei night scene date good choice
有小孩後第一次來lounge bar用餐，難得有沒限制小孩入場的，服務人員Edmond非常專業貼心，對小孩也很有耐心，讓父母能好好享用餐點跟美酒,"When there is a child, I came to Lounge Bar to dine for the first time. It is rare to restrict the child's entry. The service staff EDMOND is very professional and intimate. It is also very patient with the child."
"這次吃完晚餐經過，只來喝調酒，下次有機會再來吃吃看餐點，露台視野很棒，一邊喝酒一邊閒聊很愜意。
這次點了一杯野格為底的，因為個人很喜歡野格，平常也都單喝，所以覺得這杯調酒味道很棒，另外一杯whisky shot味道也不錯噢。
每桌有不同低消，建議去之前先詢問噢：）","After dinner this time, I will only drink alcohol. I have the opportunity to eat and watch the meal next time. The field of the terrace is great.
This time I ordered a cup of wild grid. Because I like wild grid very much, I usually drink it alone, so I think this cup of bartender tastes great, and another cup of Whism Shot tastes good.
There are different low consumption at each table. It is recommended to ask before you go before you ask :)"
"第一次來體驗20樓酒吧，
感覺良好，人也不會很多， 燈光裝飾精美，音樂營造嗨的氛圍，還能夠去外面看夜景，值得來光顧無數次🤣 …","First time to experience the 20th floor bar,
It feels good, there are not many people, exquisite light decoration, music creates a hi atmosphere, and can go outside to see the night view. It is worth visiting countless times ..."

The Taipei Landscape Hotel/Hotel/Restaurant is already an option to enjoy/high atmosphere. I rarely enter the bar restaurant, and I will come here because of fate.Just enjoy it!Marriott is a large national enterprise organization. There are also many points under all over the world. They have a certain reputation. Here are the Dazhi Center. Many foreigners are frequent customers here. In the consumer place, I ordered a cup of Shan's Tea Time and Nanyang Fried Chicken. I think this light bartending is really delicious. Good eat!The biggest selling point here is the landscape."
"餐點氣氛都不錯
但是最好不要雨天去
無法出去大露天看夜景
消費不算便宜","The atmosphere of the meal is good
But it's best not to go rainy days
Can't go out to see the night view
Consumption is not cheap"
初五晚上跟四位好友一起來晚餐，推薦餐點非常到位，服務人員很親切，隨時能加入話題，但又不失分寸，位在20樓高，餐廳外view超好 信義區重要地標全部進入眼簾~,"On the evening of the fifth day, I came to dinner with four friends. The recommended meal was very in place. The service staff was very kind and could join the topic at any time, but it was high in the 20th floor. Eyes ~"
"調酒好喝，食物表現一般，景色是最大賣點，可以俯瞰台北盆地城市繁華。

服務態度待加強，服務員感覺心情很差，對客人沒有耐心，不符五星級飯店應有的水準。","The bartending is delicious, the food performance is average, and the scenery is the biggest selling point, which can overlook the bustling cities of Taipei Basin.

The service attitude is to be strengthened. The waiter feels very poor and has no patience to the guests. It does not match the level of the five -star hotel."
"配酒的牛肉三明治、起士拼盤都不錯吃
生蠔如果能再冰一點那就更完美
氣氛不錯
滿適合情侶約會的地方
點一杯inge’s tea time 喝起來滿清爽
推薦給女生","The beef sandwiches with wine and the cheese platter are good
If the oysters can be a little bit more iced, it will be more perfect
The atmosphere is good
Full of places for couples to date
Click a cup of Inge ’s Tea Time
Recommended to girls"
"東西不難吃，酒也還可以(冰塊實在太多，太強迫消費

建議的消費方式是吃很飽再來，一人點一杯酒就好

第一不推是貴，一杯400算是飯店價格但一杯有3/2是冰塊就不ok
第二是冷氣，颱風天開22度（還是其實是16度？），幾乎所有座位上的女生都一進門就抱著手臂，看到好幾桌要熱水，得到的答案都是（不好意思我們沒有熱水，但有賣熱茶）...
在國外很多地方酒吧不給水是違法的，也許台灣不是，但平均一人消費要1000塊的地方，給一杯熱水可能也不算過分，想提高消費是對的，但給客人印象不好可能要再加強。","It is not difficult to eat, and wine is okay (there are too many ice cubes, too forced consumption

The recommended consumption method is to eat very full, just order a glass of wine, just order a glass of wine

The first is not expensive, a cup of 400 is a hotel price, but a cup has 3/2 that the ice is not OK
The second is air -conditioning, the typhoon opened 22 degrees (or is it actually 16 degrees?), Almost all girls in all seats holding their arms as soon as they entered the door, seeing several tables of hot water, the answers I got were There is no hot water, but there are hot tea) ...
It is illegal to not give water in many places abroad. Maybe Taiwan is not, but the average person consumption of 1,000 yuan for one person may not be too much to give a cup of hot water. Strengthen."
"燈光美、氣氛佳、視野好，優點大概就僅止於硬體部分。

餐點水準尚可，點了很多道菜，可惜沒有任何一道令人驚豔。

服務部分有很大的加強空間，負責控場的男服務生應對沒有溫度外，多次感受到他回話時的不耐煩與缺乏溫度。

我認為以這樣的價位，在這樣五星酒店會有好的體驗感受，實際上卻是讓人有些失望，不符合期待。","The light is beautiful, the atmosphere is good, and the vision is good, and the advantages are probably only the hardware.

The level of meals is okay, and I ordered a lot of dishes, but unfortunately there is no amazing.

The service part has a lot of room for enhanced space. The male waiter responsible for controlling the field has no temperature, and he feels that he has repeatedly felt impatient and lack of temperature when he answered his talk.

I think that at this price, there will be a good experience in such a five -star hotel, but it is actually disappointed and does not meet expectations."
"夜景很美，不過冬天晚上風蠻大。
有半開放式包廂，可以盡情聊天，餐點的部分尚可，整個環境氣氛很好","The night scene is beautiful, but the wind is quite strong in winter.
There is a half -open box, which can be chatted as much as possible."
"服務生人粉好，氣氛也佳，飲品都好喝，因疫情沒開放外面,抽菸請至3樓","The waiter is good, the atmosphere is also good, and the drinks are delicious. Because the epidemic is not open, please smoke to the 3rd floor."
餐點整體而言中規中矩，但價位真的偏高，氣氛很不錯，外面露台的view也很好。btw 前菜用便當盒端上來時有點小傻眼XD,"The meal is quite satisfactory as a whole, but the price is really high, the atmosphere is very good, and the View on the outer terrace is also very good.The btw front dish is a little dumbfounded when it comes up from the bento box. XD"
"景色很好，大概是建在航空區邊界的優勢吧
調酒雖然有喝到不是自己的愛好，但是每一杯的調配都很順口，食材也好吃，服務人員友善親切，環境舒適，在飯店價格合理","The scenery is very good, probably the advantage built on the border of the aviation area, right?
Although drinking is not your own hobby, the deployment of each cup is very smooth, the ingredients are delicious, the service staff is friendly and kind, the environment is comfortable, and the price of the hotel is reasonable."
氣氛好、風景好、餐點好，每年生日.情人節.結婚紀念日必來的餐廳❤️,"Good atmosphere, good scenery, good meals, every year's birthday, Valentine's Day. The restaurant must come to the wedding anniversary ❤️"
調酒非常好喝！！服務業很讚 天氣好的時候景色真的無敵 喜歡❤️❤️❤️,The bartender is very delicious!IntersectionThe service industry is very good when the weather is good.
服務品質很好，餐具每個餐點重新遞上新的刀叉，餐點好吃，有一定的水準，紅白酒好喝～整體來說很不錯，很棒的約會用餐地點～,The quality of the service is very good. Each meal of the tableware is re -handed in a new knife and fork. The meal is delicious and there is a certain level. The red and white wine is delicious ~ Overall is very good.
"今年新開幕的酒店，環境很不錯，喜歡它低調黑色的裝潢，因為是晚上去的所以看到夜景，
幫我們安排的位置靠窗邊，天氣好時邊享用餐點還能看到101。

服務品質當然是沒話說，畢竟是高級酒店
餐點的部分，我這次品嚐的是2200的套餐，
部分餐點可以加價升級，從開胃菜到主餐綜合大約評價3顆半星(已此價位衡量)還有很多發揮空間。

不過聽服務員說招牌是調酒，下次光臨時一定試試!!","The newly opened hotel this year, the environment is very good, I like its low -key black decoration, because it is going to go at night, so I see the night view.
The position where we arranged for us are against the window. When the weather is good, you can see 101 at a meal.

The service quality is of course nothing to say, after all, it is a high -end hotel
For the meal part, I tasted the 2200 package this time.
Some meals can be upgraded to increase the price, and there is still a lot of room for exerting 3 half stars from appetizing dishes to main meals (measured at this price).

However, listening to the waiter said that the signboard is bartender, and the next time you will try it temporarily !!"
"五星級飯店但外場服務沒有到五星級的水準，部分服務人員不在狀況內，當初兌換調酒的時候，服務人員還質疑我們已經換過了，跟他說請他確認一下，先前服務人員收走的券，他回應是：哪個你跟我說哪個？

讓人有種挑釁味道，燈光這麼暗服務人員這麼多，怎麼可能認得出來
雖然事後其他女服務人員有來關心，但這樣的服務真的不該出現在五星飯店內。","Five -star restaurants but the outfield service did not reach the level of five -star. Some service personnel were not in the situation. When the bartender was redeemed, the service staff also questioned that we had changed. I asked him to confirm that the previous service staff was previously asked. The voucher that took away was: Which one you told me?

Let people have a provocative taste. How can it be recognized as so that the light service staff is so dark?
Although other female service staff came to care, such services should really not appear in the five -star hotel."
"夜景超美的酒吧,調酒就還OK,偏咩酒,不過來這裡聚會很舒服,可以俯瞰大直夜景,服務生每個看起來都很犀利的感覺","The night scene is super beautiful, and the bartending is still OK, some wine, but the party is very comfortable to come here. You can overlook the big night view. Each waiter looks very sharp."
"每樣料理都有他水準
真的好吃夜景也美
值得～","Every dish has his level
It's really delicious night scene and beautiful
It's worth ~"
"餐點精緻 服務得宜。
從樓頂往外看去 摩天輪 圓山飯店 淡水河一覽靡遺 也釋放了視覺的疲勞！","The meals are delicious.
From the top of the building, the Ferris Wheel Yuanshan Hotel Tamsui River has also released visual fatigue!"
"去了很多次，不論用餐、慶生、喝酒都蠻棒的
很有氣氛，夜景也是","After going many times, whether dining, birthday, drinking, drinking is great
Very atmospheric, the night scene is also"
夜景相當不錯，酒吧區的低消550（500+10%），服務人員態度不錯，可是刷卡少刷1元，要補刷一次有點囧。,"The night scene is quite good. The low consumption of the bar area is 550 (500+10%). The attitude of the service staff is good, but swipe the card 1 yuan less."
晚餐餐點尚可，夜景美麗，但服務非常不專業，以這種價格，在台北可以有更好的選擇。,"Dinner is okay, the night view is beautiful, but the service is very unprofessional. At this price, you can have a better choice in Taipei."
"景色美，調酒非常好喝，不小心ㄧ下就2杯了😆
服務人員非常親切有禮","The scenery is beautiful, and the bartender is very delicious, I accidentally take 2 cups 😆
The service staff is very kind and polite"
INGE'S Bar & Grill 位於台北萬豪酒店20F，遠望台北信義101商圈，景色媲美東京 、香港或新加坡， 氣氛相當不錯，餐點用心，價格算是公道，我接二連三地去了好多次，櫃檯的 Tina 小姐服務親切，過目不忘的記憶力，真是適合服務業的特質。對了這裡的下酒菜可以很台式喔！,"Inge's Bar & Grill is located in the 20F of Taipei Marriott Hotel, and looks at the Shinhe 101 business district in Taipei. The scenery is comparable to Tokyo, Hong Kong or Singapore. The atmosphere is quite good. The memory that is kind and unforgettable is really suitable for the service industry.By the way, the dishes here can be very desktop!"
"氛圍佳
音樂聲較大 有點適合要跳舞的感覺
夜景好
調酒口味不太好","Good atmosphere
The sound of music is a bit suitable for dancing
Good night view
The taste of bartender is not very good"
"很喜歡20樓的景色
20樓的餐廳食物也很棒
來杯酒搭配美食美景
是一個非常享受的時刻","I really like the scenery on the 20th floor
The restaurant on the 20th floor is also great
Come to a glass of wine with food beauty
It's a very enjoyable moment"
"餐點賣相佳、口味差
還吃到急性腸胃炎⋯⋯

服務態度良好，但服務品質不優

兩個人點了快九千
餐點部分
牛排 $2380 但肉質不好 除了薄以外、筋很多 超級難咬
生蠔是我見過比較好的餐廳裡面最小的⋯
連市民大道的蚵仔都他大
吃完隔天急性腸胃炎 醫生說是吃到不新鮮的海鮮⋯
炒蕈菇聞起來很香 但蒜放太多 第一次吃東西被蒜辣到嗆到
比較值得點的只有龍蝦麵

服務部分
湯上來後等了35分鐘 主餐一直沒上
詢問服務人員後他態度非常好的問我們要幫我們準備了嗎？因為想說桌上還有東西會放不下就還沒開始做
西餐正常餐廳是會自己抓時間的不是嗎？不然時間過長也是可以詢問客人的 那時這區就我們一桌客人 服務人員也一直站在旁邊沒離開過 不至於會有忙到忘記的情況發生
態度很好但細節都沒注意到

再加油","The meal sells good and the taste is bad
I also eat acute gastroenteritis ...

The service attitude is good, but the quality of service is not good

Two people ordered almost nine thousand
Meal part
Steak $ 2380, but the meat is not good. In addition to thinness, there are many superb bite
Oyster is the smallest in the restaurant I have ever seen ...
Even the Taipa of Citizen Avenue is big
After eating acute gastroenteritis, doctors said that they have eaten fresh seafood ...
The frying mushroom smells very fragrant, but the garlic is put on too much for the first time and was spicy by garlic to stretch
Only lobster noodles are worthy of point

Service part
After the soup came up, I waited for 35 minutes.
After asking the service staff, he asked us if he was ready to help us prepare?Because I want to say that there are still things on the table, I ca n’t let it go, I haven't started to do it yet
Western restaurants in Western restaurants will grasp their own time, isn't it?Otherwise, if the time is too long, you can also ask the guests at that time, the service staff of our table of our tables has been standing next to it.
The attitude is very good, but the details are not noticed

"氣氛好夜景漂亮
服務態度須加強
龍蝦麵好吃
-不會回訪","The atmosphere is so beautiful
Service attitude must be strengthened
Lobster noodles delicious

入住萬豪有酒吧很加分😂，氣氛不錯，歌好聽，景很美很好拍，調酒很好喝，服務態度也很好，小小可惜沒有特別漂亮裝飾的酒🍸 …,"Check in Marriott has a bonus, the atmosphere is good, the song is good, the scene is beautiful and good, the bartending is delicious, the service attitude is also very good, but the small unfortunately there is no particularly beautiful decorative wine 🍸 ..."
"萬豪20樓
氣氛好，不會吵。今天印象深刻的是特色調酒Golden Treacle
前味是鳳梨煙燻的香氣，中間是age Rum和威士忌，後面用班蘭葉收尾，整體而言風味不錯，但後面融水多了後感覺有點偏甜一點，如果不愛偏甜的口感要注意飲用時間。

View好，服務不錯，推薦可二訪","Marriott 20th Floor
The atmosphere is good, it will not be noisy.What impressed me today is the specialty bartend
The former taste is the smoky aroma of pineapple. In the middle is Age Rum and whiskey, and the Banlan leaves are closed in the back. The overall flavor is good, but it feels a bit sweet after melting water. Pay attention to drinking time.

View is good, good service, I recommend two visits"
餐點好吃，環境有氣氛和浪漫，餐點偏貴cp值不高，適合偶爾慶祝或約會,"The meal is delicious, the environment has the atmosphere and romance, the cp value is not high, it is suitable for occasional celebrations or dating"
"晚餐後來到Inge's Bar喝飲料~
燈光美氣氛佳夜景也很棒，營業時間也很晚，還有戶外座位。

（借了朋友的雪茄拍照）
（每個人低消好像1000。）","After dinner, go to Inge's Bar to drink drinks ~
The lights of the lights are also great, and the business hours are very late. There are also outdoor seats.

(Borrowed a friend's cigar to take a picture)
(Everyone seems to be 1,000.)"
"賣的是氣氛

桌邊服務不及時又不禮貌
餐廳不值這個價","The atmosphere is selling

The service on the table is not timely and impolite in time
The restaurant is not worth the price"
10/23用餐為大地萬豪聯賣含的套餐，餐點美味，服務很好，很適合家人情侶節日來用餐,"10/23 Diet for the package for the Dadi Marriott, delicious meal, good service, very suitable for family and couples to come to dine"

餐點算好吃，服務也不錯喔。景觀很讚，座位不會太擠，滿舒服的。,"The meal is delicious and the service is good.The landscape is very good, the seats will not be too crowded, full of comfort."
在臺北萬豪酒店20樓高空酒吧，景觀優美氛圍很棒，牛排甜點非常美味，調酒好喝，值得小酌放鬆心情,"On the 20th floor of the Taipei Marriott Hotel, the beautiful atmosphere of the landscape is great, the steak dessert is very delicious, the bartender is delicious, it is worth relaxing the mood"
"晚餐結束後意猶未盡前往萬豪酒店續攤。
好像是第三次前往。
這個bar環境氣氛燈光俱佳氣氛下，來瓶粉紅氣泡香檳更是相得益彰, 拿著酒杯到戶外欣賞夜景，也是挺浪漫的。","After dinner, I went to the Marriott Hotel to renew.
It seems to be the third time.
In this BAR environment atmosphere, the light is good, and the bottle of pink bubble champagne is even more complemented. It is also romantic to hold the glass to enjoy the night view outdoors."
幫男友慶祝生日🎂主餐牛排特別好吃，環境跟氣氛都很浪漫，餐廳還貼心的準備了生日小蛋糕跟兩杯shot❤️下次要再來喝喝調酒🍸如果在這跨年一定很美好☺️☺️☺️ …,"Help my boyfriend celebrate the birthday 餐 Steak, the steak is particularly delicious, the environment and the atmosphere are very romantic. The restaurant also carefully prepared the birthday cake and two cups of shot❤️ to drink and drink again next time. …️☺️☺️… ..."
服務人員專業，氣氛很棒景色很好，唯如果剛好坐在音響旁音量有點太大聲,"The service staff is professional, and the atmosphere is great, the scenery is very good, but if you just sit on the sound of the sound, the sound is a bit too loud"
景很好，酒不錯，食物也不壞，但以價位來說這服務簡直令人髮指，問問題時若詢問不同員工，會得到各種不同的答案，服務也完全只有點餐而已，語氣也不知道在兇怎樣的，點了酒也會忘記，而且明明訂了包廂，到現場卻像是被欺騙了，根本只是ㄇ字形沙發區，所謂的包廂完全只是騙低消而已，人數分布也跟事前說的不一樣(大概是包廂不知為何給貴客了，拿沙發區搪塞我們吧，跟事先知道的不是同個包廂)，剛到時電梯還上不去，我們一群人塞在電梯裡面大概超過五分鐘吧，蠻傻眼的,"The scenery is very good, the wine is good, and the food is not bad, but in terms of price, this service is simply 指. If you ask questions when asking questions, you will get various answers. I do n’t know what is fierce, I will forget it after ordering the wine, and I clearly book the box, but it seems to be deceived at the scene. It is just a font sofa area. What you said beforehand (probably the box, I do n’t know why it is given to the nobles. Take us with the sofa area and do n’t know the same box as you know in advance). When the elevator just arrives, the elevator can not go up. Five minutes, it's dumbfounded"
"推薦雞肉澄清湯!鮪魚塔塔, 美國頂級菲力不錯!紐西蘭高地和羊!","Recommended chicken clarification soup! The catfish tower, the top Fili in the United States is good! New Zealand highland and sheep!"
"酒好喝，冬季系列超讚，東西很難吃（炸雞）又貴（薯條$380）
吃飽再來，夏天可坐戶外滿chill
開放式包廂消費不低","The wine is delicious, the winter series is superb, and things are difficult to eat (fried chicken) and expensive (French fries $ 380)

"一兩個月沒來，應該是換老闆了，以前親切的、舒服的、令人十分滿意的服務已經完全消失。大概是不缺客人，所以不用提供跟萬豪酒店五星等級一樣的服務吧！
打一星都太多了！下次不會再來！","I haven't come for a month or two. It should be changed to the boss. The kind, comfortable, and very satisfactory service had completely disappeared.Probably there is no shortage of guests, so there is no need to provide the same service as the five -star level as the Marriott Hotel!
There are too many stars!I won't come again next time!"
"令人失望的服務，可惜了漂亮景色
服務人員口氣跟態度 讓人懷疑是關系戶進來的
有個男的服務員全程臭臉，問問題都很不耐煩，不知得罪他什麼...

1.詢問能不能加椅子，回說你們座擠一點就好了

2.請問紅酒有推薦的嗎？ 服務生說 house wine 都差不多，你們自己看就走了","Disappointed service, but unfortunately beautiful scenery
The service staff's breath and attitude make people suspect that the relationship is coming in
A man's waiter was stinky throughout the process, and he was very impatient to ask questions. I wonder what he offended him ...

1. Ask if you can add a chair, just say that your seat is squeezed a bit

2. Is there any recommended red wine?The waiter said House Wine is almost the same, and you leave it yourself"
除了美麗的view以外，其他真的不怎麼樣，有服務生的表情，好像欠他幾百萬，餐點非常的普通。,"Except for the beautiful View, others are really not very good. There is an expression of a waiter, as if it owes millions of million, and the meal is very ordinary."
蠻優的餐廳與遠眺景點，價格略高。,The pretty restaurant and the distant attractions are slightly higher.

我和我的台灣朋友一起去了。因為是晚餐後，所以只吃了薯條之類的快餐，但也很好吃。氣氛和服務都很好，90%的客人是本地人，10%來自歐美。晚上10點以後？當DJ開始演奏時，現場變得熱鬧起來，所以我們搬到了露台。這是一個熱鬧熱鬧的好地方，但如果您想享受交談的樂趣，我們建議您早點到達。非常感謝。下次去台北一定會再來看你們的！","2024/09/12
I went with my Taiwanese friends.Because it was dinner, I only ate fast food like fries, but it was also delicious.The atmosphere and services are very good. 90%of the guests are locals and 10%come from Europe and the United States.After 10 pm?When DJ started playing, the scene became lively, so we moved to the terrace.This is a lively and lively place, but if you want to enjoy the fun, we recommend that you arrive early.Thank you so much.Next time I go to Taipei, I will come to see you again!"
氣氛真的很好。台北的風景真好。我們星期三晚上來到這裡。我建議在日落時來戶外拍攝令人驚嘆的照片。拿了羊架（太棒了）和和牛（煮得很完美！）套餐。在旁邊添加了通心粉奶酪，你不會後悔的。最後我們已經吃飽了，只好把甜點帶走。  優質的服務（來自凱西和另一位為我提供葡萄酒的服務員。我沒聽清名字）。將與想要欣賞台北美景和美好體驗的朋友一起回來。,"The atmosphere is really good.The scenery in Taipei is so good.We came here on Wednesday night.I suggest to take an amazing photo outdoors at sunset.Take the sheep (great) and the cow (cooked perfectly!) Package.Added pink cheese next to it, you will not regret it.In the end, we were full, so we had to take away the dessert.High -quality services (from Casey and another waiter who provided me with wine. I did not hear the name).He will come back with friends who want to enjoy Taipei and the beautiful experience."
位於 20 樓的豪華餐廳，提供高品質的食物和服務。您可以走出去，欣賞整個台北市的美景。,Luxury restaurants on the 20th floor provide high -quality food and services.You can go out and enjoy the beauty of the entire Taipei City.
這絕對是一個擁有合適氛圍、美味食物和絕佳景色的好地方。儘管這裡主要適合成年人，但當我們帶著孩子一起來時，他們非常樂於助人。他們玩得很開心。從開胃菜到甜點，每一道菜都很棒。他們的海鮮非常新鮮，肉烤得恰到好處。我們在這裡度過了一段愉快的時光，這為我們的台灣之旅畫上了圓滿的句號。,"This is definitely a good place with a suitable atmosphere, delicious food and excellent scenery.Although it is mainly suitable for adults, they are very helpful when we bring their children.They played very happily.From appetizing dishes to desserts, every dish is great.Their seafood is very fresh and the meat is grilled just right.We have a happy time here, which draws a successful end for our trip to Taiwan."
預定了假日早午餐 大概要一個月前訂才會有位置 風景很好 可以直接看到101 但我嗎那天後來天氣很不好 下雨就什麼都看不到囉！ 我們點了雙人套餐印像中$1600左右那杯調酒需額外加$220 最夯的花園沙拉我們沒有點不過大概1點前就會被點完可是那隻是菜掛起來啊⋯ 小小的鹹派每個口味都一樣看起來很普通但吃起來是好吃的炸雞也不錯放在骨頭裡的生牛肉塔塔很好吃等了有點久的鬆餅口感很好本來以為會吃不夠結果意外的兩人到最後一道有點吃不下每人至少$1000 基本上就是好吃又好拍不是空有其表而是真的有好吃喔！,"I have to book a month ago for a month ago. There will be a month ago that there will be a good location. You can see 101 directly. But I can see anything if the weather is not good that day!We ordered about $ 1600 in the two -person package impression. The cup of bartender needs to be added to the most rammed garden salad for $ 220. We do n’t order it before 1 o'clock. The taste is the same as ordinary, but it tastes delicious fried chicken. The raw beef tower that placed in the bones is delicious. Wait a long time. The last one can't eat a little bit, at least $ 1000 per person is basically delicious and good. It is not empty, but it is really delicious!"
無可挑剔的景色、食物、飲料和服務。這是您在台北舉辦特殊場合的完美場所。靠窗的座位可以直接看到台北101，這是一個巨大的優勢。我們很喜歡我們的牛排。,"Infinite scenery, food, beverages and services.This is the perfect place for you to host special occasions in Taipei.The seat of the window can be directly seen in Taipei 101, which is a huge advantage.We like our steak very much."
特別慶祝活動的完美場所。美味的食物和台北美麗的天際線。菜單上沒有素食主菜，但他們為我準備了蔬菜過去，超級美味,"Special celebration of the perfect place.Delicious food and the beautiful skyline in Taipei.There are no vegetarian main dishes on the menu, but they have prepared vegetables for me, super delicious"
大直最美 view也最好的酒吧！,Dazhi's most beautiful View and the best bar!
套餐只能在秀廚區點， 酒吧區的沙發區只能單點， 就看你是想看廚師還是美景決定吃什麽了。 大露台可惜了，空空盪， 一下關中間的門 一下關側門 只看客人不時在撞門， 完全沒五星酒店的氣派， 連小酒吧都比不上。,"The package can only be in the show kitchen area, and the sofa area of ​​the bar area can only be used. It depends on whether you want to see the chef or the beautiful scene.It is a pity that the big terrace is empty and empty. The door in the middle of the closing is closed and the side door only looks at the guests from time to time. There is no style of the five -star hotel at all."
在那裡吃早午餐。我們點了 4 道菜，都很好吃。工作人員也非常專業和友好。最棒的是，你可以在座位上欣賞台北市的壯麗景色，而不會曬黑。 ;),"Whenever a morning lunch.We ordered 4 dishes, all of which were delicious.The staff is also very professional and friendly.The best thing is that you can enjoy the magnificent scenery of Taipei in the seat without being dark.;)"
氣氛很好，如果點菜的話，兩個人共享的話預計花費3000-6000。份量很小，所以肯定會比平常訂購更多。菜單很小，但我強烈推薦乾豬肉燴飯。我們也要求點一些套餐菜單上的東西，但不能點菜。他們很高興地答應了，我們對這項服務非常滿意。,"The atmosphere is very good. If you order, it is expected to spend 3,000-6000 if the two are shared.The portion is very small, so it will definitely order more than usual.The menu is very small, but I strongly recommend dried pork risks.We also ask to order something on some package menu, but we cannot order.They were glad to agree, we were very satisfied with this service."
"這是一個非常神奇的地方，如果你有機會來台北，並且很想看看台北101美麗的夜景，你一定要來至少住一晚，記得上20樓來這家酒吧
雞尾酒原創且富有創意，您一定會喜歡的！","This is a very amazing place. If you have the opportunity to come to Taipei and want to see the beautiful night view of Taipei 101, you must come and live at least one night. Remember to come to this bar on the 20th floor.
Cocktail is original and creative, you will definitely like it!"
這是一家風景優美的餐廳。你可以看到101塔和許多星星。松露薯條有點鹹。啤酒和雞尾酒都不錯。,This is a beautiful restaurant.You can see the 101 tower and many stars.Tulled fries are a bit salty.Beer and cocktails are good.
非常適合生日晚餐或慶祝活動。景色令人驚嘆，服務也是一流的。這是我在城裡吃過的最好的奶酪通心粉，晚餐也物有所值。,"Very suitable for birthday dinner or celebration.The scenery is amazing and the service is first -class.This is the best cheese I have eaten in the city, and dinner is worth it."
從 20 樓可以看到美麗的景色，優質的全方位服務（除了不從酒店其他地方帶食物 - 會的，因為我們有一個人幾天前食物中毒了），美味的牛排。  唯一令人失望的是平淡的海鮮湯，但從頭到尾都很棒,"From the 20th floor, you can see the beautiful scenery, high -quality full -service service (except that you do not bring food from other places in the hotel, because we have a person a few days ago, food poisoning), delicious steak.The only disappointment is the bland seafood soup, but it is great from beginning to end"
"景色還不錯。飲料有點淡但是很好吃。價格還可以，與洛杉磯的酒吧價格相當。
只有 3 顆星，因為服務很慢。我又要了一杯我正在喝的飲料，花了大約 20 分鐘。","The scenery is not bad.The drink is a bit light but delicious.The price is okay, which is equivalent to the price of a bar in Los Angeles.
There are only 3 stars, because the service is very slow.I asked for another drink I was drinking, and it took about 20 minutes."
風景很好的屋頂酒吧。但價格略高。位置很好，附近有百貨公司和地鐵系統。我在這裡舉辦了一個新年派對，景色非常棒。,"The landscape is very good roof bar.But the price is slightly higher.The location is very good, there are department stores and subway systems nearby.I held a new year party here, and the scenery was great."
"美麗的景色。不過現在很少打開露台了...
酒吧食物的食物非常昂貴。","Beautiful scenery.But now I rarely open the terrace ...
Bar food food is very expensive."
當你想要奢華濃鬱的味道時...廚師把牛肉烤得真好😍,When you want a luxurious and rich taste ... the chef bakes the beef so well 😍
很棒的頂樓酒吧，可以欣賞台北的壯麗景色。您可以看到河對岸松山機場的飛機起降。這裡的食物和飲料也很棒。我點了一些美味的炸雞塊來搭配我的雞尾酒。把我的雞尾酒帶到露臺上，欣賞美景，享受輕鬆的時光。,"A great top floor bar, you can enjoy the magnificent scenery of Taipei.You can see the aircraft of Songshan Airport on the other side of the river.The food and drinks here are also great.I ordered some delicious fried chicken pieces to match my cocktails.Take my cocktail to the terrace, enjoy the beauty, and enjoy the relaxed time."
"走到這裡就到了101觀景台。晚上10點左右，DJ會播放俱樂部歌曲，所以如果你在9點到10點30分左右去，可以享受兩種氛圍。您必須預訂靠窗的座位。冬天最好只去外面的露台拍照。夜景真是太棒了。
每人必須點500美元以上，但每人點一杯酒為宜。我喜歡它，因為它比酒店便宜。","When you come here, you will reach the 101 Observation Deck.At about 10 pm, DJ will play club songs, so if you go around 9:00 to 10:30, you can enjoy the two atmosphere.You must book a seat against the window.It is best to go to the outer terrace to take pictures in winter.The night scene is really great.
Each person must order more than $ 500, but it is advisable to order a glass of wine.I like it because it is cheaper than a hotel."
"美麗的夜景和美味的食物。
但價格確實不便宜...
約會的好地方...","Beautiful night view and delicious food.
But the price is really not cheap ...
Good place to date ..."

"極度糟糕的用餐經驗!

1. 服務: 要嘛訓練不足，就是公司心態或個人反應有問題!
(1)慶生問題-這次去最重要的目的!

第一次是某個週日晚上要幫朋友慶生，當天晚上用餐時，還利用上洗手間提醒櫃台，但最後還是忘了在甜點上裝飾跟放蠟燭!

第二次則是當晚電話告知會晚點到時，也再次提醒要慶生，但依舊忘記在客人的提點上做裝飾，後來是朋友去反應，才補了一份甜點，上面放了一塊寫著Happy Birthday的牌子，當下慶生的感覺也都沒了!

P.s 我不是奧課，但我不得不說，很多西餐廳，只要知道客人要慶祝，都會主動多準備一份小蛋糕上面寫著生日快樂，有的還可以寫名子!

(2) 座位問題

第二次用餐時是星期一，人很少，整晚沒超過5桌客人。我們兩個被安排在兩人的沙發座位，有對外窗，但主建物101都被擋住了，加上桌子是橢圓桌，非常小，當下反應希望換到旁邊的大桌，但服務員卻說，那桌被訂滿了，於是被安排到靠牆的大圓桌座位，結果，一直到用餐結束，我們希望做的座位，從頭到尾都沒人入座! 感覺很差!

(3) 點餐過程中許多問題也是牛頭不對馬嘴

2. 餐點
(1) 因食量小，且規定套餐一定要同桌的人都要點(太怪了吧! 很多西餐廳都可以點一份套餐，另一個人單點主餐。)所以單點了麵包、黑松露濃湯、羊排、牛菲力、巧克力熔岩冰淇淋、紅酒。

(2) 過程前提醒服務員餐點好了都可以直接上，服務員卻說，主餐製作約要30分鐘(當天人很少喔)，想說沒關係，還是希望盡快。結果麵包跟湯都是過了10分鐘到、20分鐘後才分別上，主餐則是55分鐘。

(3) 誇張的是，松露濃湯喝起來很辣，沒有鬆露味，當下跟服務生反應，他拿回去廚房後說廚房試過了，並沒有加胡椒。但，越喝越辣，剛好副理在，再次跟他反應，經過他詢問後，才坦承有加了白胡椒!

(4) 麵包上來時已經不熱了，奶油是硬的，根本無法塗在麵包上，跟女服務員反應後也沒有換新的，後來原服務員前來跟他反應他說"" 我去為你們換一個為你們特製的奶油!"" 言下之意，原來他們給客人都是硬梆梆、冷冷的奶油!

(5) 羊排份量只有小小的兩根，要1480，詢問服務員後說有7盎司! 這也太誇張了!

(6) 甜點: 端上來時候，冰淇淋像冰棒，根本無法用叉子還有湯匙搭配巧克力熔岩蛋糕一起享用，且巧克力熔岩蛋糕冷冰冰的，沒有熱度，是全世界吃過最糟糕的!

補送的白桃雪烙，白桃是切薄博的幾片(相對於安東廳的整顆法國白桃...)，雪烙也是像冰棒依樣!

只能說，A級價格， C級餐點跟服務!","Extremely bad dining experience!

1. Services: Well, there is insufficient training, that is, the company's mentality or personal response is wrong!
(1) The issue of celebration-the most important purpose this time!

The first time was to help friends to celebrate his birthday on Sunday night. When dining that night, he also used the toilet to remind the counter, but in the end, I forgot to decorate and put candles on desserts!

The second time was that the call would be late that night, and I reminded you to celebrate his birthday again, but he still forgot to decorate the guest's lifting point. Later, a friend responded to make up for a dessert. The brand of Happy Birthday, the feeling of celebrating the birthday is gone now!

P.S I am not an Olympic class, but I have to say that many western restaurants, as long as the guests want to celebrate, will take the initiative to prepare more small cakes with a happy birthday, and some can write a name!

(2) seat problem

The second meal was Monday, there were very few people, and there were no more than 5 tables of guests all night.The two of us were arranged on the sofa seats of the two, and there were external windows, but the main building 101 was blocked. In addition, the table was an elliptical table, very small. The table was full, so it was arranged to the large round table seats against the wall. As a result, until the end of the meal, the seat we wanted to make, no one in from beginning to end! It feels bad!

(3) Many problems in the order of ordering are also bulls.

2. Meal
(1) Because the amount of food is small, and the person who stipulates that the package must be ordered at the same table (too strange! Many western restaurants can order a package, and the other person can order the main meal.) Tulutan soup, lamb chops, cow Feili, chocolate lava ice cream, red wine.

(2) Before the process, the waiter can go directly to the meal, but the waiter said that the main meal will take about 30 minutes (there are very few people on the day). If you want to say it is okay, he still wants to be as soon as possible.As a result, the bread and the soup were separated after 10 minutes and 20 minutes, and the main meal was 55 minutes.

(3) The exaggeration is that the truffle soup is very spicy and there is no truffle smell. At the moment, he reacted with the waiter. After taking it back to the kitchen, he said that the kitchen tried and did not add pepper.However, the more I drink, the hotter, and the deputy manager is here to respond to him again. After he asked, he admitted that he had added white pepper!

(4) The bread is no longer hot when it comes up. The cream is hard and cannot be applied to the bread. After responding to the female waiter, she did not change the new one. Later, the original waiter came to respond to him. A special cream for you! ""In the consent, they originally gave the guests a hard and cold cream!

(5) There are only two small amounts of sheep chopping, which requires 1480. After asking the waiter, there are 7 ounces! This is too exaggerated!

(6) Dessert: When it comes up, the ice cream is like a popsicle, and it is impossible to enjoy with a fork and a spoon with a spoon with a chip lava cake, and the chocolate lava cake is cold. There is no popularity. It has eaten the worst in the world!

The white peach snow is made, and the white peaches are a few slices (compared to the entire French white peach in the Antong Hall ...), the snow is also like a popsicle!

It can only be said that A -level price, C -level meal and service!"
很棒的酒吧。  天氣允許時美麗的地區。  很棒的蘇格蘭威士忌和威士忌選擇。,A great bar.The beautiful area is allowed when the weather allows.Great Scottish whiskey and whiskey choice.
美麗的景色和美味的燒烤菜餚。,Beautiful scenery and delicious barbecue dishes.
每個人都知道這裡的全景景色令人驚嘆，雞尾酒正宗且富有創意。我只是不知道這裡的食物也令人印象深刻。有很多小細節讓我驚訝，像是燒烤裡的脆蒜，或是炸薯條的肉醬。那是周一晚上，人滿為患。所以我只能假設，不只週末，甚至工作日也需要預訂。,"Everyone knows that the panoramic view here is amazing, and the cocktails are authentic and creative.I just don't know that the food here is also impressive.There are many small details that surprised me, such as the crispy garlic in the barbecue, or the meat sauce of fries.It was Monday night, and people were overcrowded.So I can only assume that not only weekends, and even working days."
"哇。
台北的最佳景觀沒有之一。 10 顆星。

好的，現在是不好的部分。
價格高得離譜。可笑的是。
如果食物達到標準，價格仍然會過高。

一頁選單上沒有圖片。老菜單。你不知道你會得到什麼。巨大的盤子，部分小於手掌大小。好市多的牛排比我的喬治·福爾曼烤架做得更好。這是三天前的事了，我仍然很痛苦。
噢，400美元的雞尾酒。不能錯過那些。非常諷刺。真是浪費啊。這是你炫耀現金的地方。你不會因為任何其他原因去那裡。一場大秀。

可怕。別傻了，走吧。從我的錯誤中學習。

馬裡奧","Wow.
There is no one of the best landscapes in Taipei.10 stars.

Okay, it is a bad part now.
The price is high.The ridiculous is.
If the food meets the standard, the price will still be too high.

There are no pictures on the menu.Old menu.You don't know what you will get.The huge plate is less than the size of the palm.Good cow steaks do better than my George Holman grill.This was a matter of three days ago, and I was still very painful.
Oh, $ 400 cocktail.Don't miss those.Very ironic.It's a waste.This is where you show off cash.You won't go there for any other reason.A big show.

horrible.Don't be stupid, let's go.Learn from my mistakes.

"大直萬豪酒店20樓的餐廳酒吧，可以喝雞尾酒。

充分利用外面的座位。
台北101可以看得很清楚，附近的摩天輪的燈光看起來也很漂亮。
一邊喝飲料一邊看夜景的絕佳去處！

不過，我認為從裡面的座位上看不到太多的夜景。

不過，餐廳酒吧的氣氛也不錯。

這一天刮著風，這在夏天是不尋常的，所以坐在外面也沒有問題。

不過，台灣是一個潮濕的國家，尤其是台北，即使在晚上也會潮濕，不適合像泰國、新加坡這樣的屋頂酒吧，所以這樣的餐廳很少。

這次飯後去喝點小酒，所以只點了油炸食品和水果。
中等，不算差，也不算差。
所以對於其他的飯菜我不太了解。

但是，如果你根據日本萬豪酒店的形象來問，那是什麼？就是這個感覺哈哈

不管怎樣，這是一個值得推薦的地方，可以去看夜景，可以在美麗的地方喝一杯！","The restaurant bar on the 20th floor of the Dahao Marriott Hotel, you can drink cocktails.

Make full use of the outside seats.
Taipei 101 can be seen very clearly, the lights of the nearby Ferris wheel look beautiful.
Drinking drinks, watch the great place to go!

However, I don't think I can see too much night view from the seat inside.

However, the atmosphere of the restaurant bar is also good.

This day is winding, which is unusual in summer, so there is no problem sitting outside.

However, Taiwan is a humid country, especially Taipei, which will be humid even at night. It is not suitable for roof bar like Thailand and Singapore, so there are very few such restaurants.

After this meal, I went to drink a little wine, so I only ordered fried food and fruits.
Middle, not bad or bad.
So I don't know much about other meals.

However, if you ask according to the image of the Marriott Hotel in Japan, what is it?That's how it feels haha

In any case, this is a recommended place, you can go to the night view, you can drink a drink in a beautiful place!"
"每人必須花費 1,100 美元。我們兩個人去不管吃不吃都花了2200 夜景很棒^^","Each person must spend $ 1,100.The two of us spend 2200 night views, regardless of whether they eat or not ^^"
"食物很棒👍，俯瞰台北101的美麗景色。
有些員工態度太強，缺乏基本的服務禮儀，感覺不像萬豪品牌。","The food is great, overlooking the beautiful scenery of Taipei 101.
Some employees are too strong, lack of basic service etiquette, and feel unlike the Marriott brand."
食物高於平均水平，但不值這個價格。  飲料很好，景色也不錯。這個地方整體評價過高。有一件事非常煩人，他們在沒有通知我的情況下向我收取了 100 新台幣一杯 12 盎司的水。  通常服務生把你帶到餐桌上後，他們會問你是否喜歡水。  如果他們收費，他們會通知您並為您帶來一整瓶。  你付了錢，你應該擁有自己的，而不僅僅是一部分。  這是我第一次，我必須為打開的瓶子裡的一小杯付錢。這太荒謬了。  你怎麼能收取一杯水而不是一瓶水的費用呢？,"Food is higher than the average level, but it is not worth the price.The drink is very good and the scenery is good.The overall evaluation of this place is too high.One thing is very annoying, they charge me 100 NT $ 100 a cup of water without notifying me.After the waiter brings you to the table, they will ask you if you like water.If they charge, they will notify you and bring you a whole bottle.If you pay, you should have your own, not just a part.This is the first time I have to pay for a small glass of the open bottle.This is too ridiculous.How can you charge a glass of water instead of a bottle of water?"
View很不錯很有氣氛，推薦晚上看夜景吃飯好地方，NTD2500的套餐（同桌的人都要點套餐，不能多人share套餐= =）比較喜歡的是白菜泥搭配松露麵包那道，加價300的主餐菲力有焦香味還不錯，加價300就有鬆露的飯真的不用浪費錢了，總之套餐不建議，還是單點好⋯有芭樂古紅茶的調酒好喝有特色,"View is very good and atmospheric. It is recommended to watch a good place for dinner at night at night. The main meal Feili has a scorching fragrance. There is really no need to waste money if there is a truffle in the price of 300. In short, the package is not recommended."
我喜歡晚餐時平靜的氛圍，但深夜音樂太大聲了。,"I like the calm atmosphere during dinner, but late night music is too loud."
災難。工作人員永遠不會檢查您的團隊。他們非常非常粗魯和不包容。即使要求額外的叉子或必需品也會遭到極端的態度。此外，許多要求都沒有滿足。整個飲料菜單只有 5-6 種基本飲料，例如杜松子酒和奎寧水。工作人員拒絕讓人們分攤帳單。他們限制團體的規模。最後，我們四到五次要求額外的椅子，但從未得到額外的椅子，儘管承諾他們會來。再次，徹底的災難。,"disaster.Staff will never check your team.They are very rude and not tolerant.Even the additional fork or necessity is required to be extreme.In addition, many requirements are not met.There are only 5-6 basic drinks in the entire beverage menu, such as Du Songzi wine and quinine water.The staff refused to let people share the bills.They limit the size of the group.Finally, we asked for extra chairs four to five times, but never obtained extra chairs, although they promised they would come.Again, a complete disaster."
"總是在這裡度過美好的時光！
美味的食物，良好的服務
我在台北最喜歡的地方之一","Always spend good time here!
Delicious food, good service
My favorite place in Taipei"
這是一家風景優美的餐廳。夜景也很美麗，建議一邊品嚐各種精心製作的雞尾酒和葡萄酒一邊用餐。我認為這非常適合情侶、朋友聚會以及生日等慶祝活動。我認為這更像是一家適合成人的餐廳，而不是有孩子的家庭的餐廳。,"This is a beautiful restaurant.The night scene is also very beautiful. It is recommended to eat all kinds of carefully made cocktails and wines.I think this is very suitable for couples, friends gatherings and birthday celebrations.I think this is more like a restaurant suitable for adults, not a family with children."
美味的食物，友好的工作人員，美妙的景色。 👍👍👍 …,美味的食物，友好的工作人員，美妙的景色。 👍👍👍 …
由於某些情況，最終的隱私比預期的要多，但用餐體驗和食物達到了五星級飯店餐廳的標準。,由於某些情況，最終的隱私比預期的要多，但用餐體驗和食物達到了五星級飯店餐廳的標準。
"台灣的服務通常很差，這個地方也不例外。  我們在面向 101 的攤位預訂了一張大桌子，但他們卻在角落裡提供了一張小桌子。  我們堅持要原來的桌子。  女主人很不情願地給了我們。  她的態度不好，缺乏訓練，需要改進。  伺服器也很慢，而且非常不專業。  諷刺的是，他們在服務不好的情況下卻收取10%的服務費。  如果服務好的話我寧願付20%。  台灣應該像北美一樣實行小費制度。

這個地方因為風景好而獲得一星。  事實上，我建議您在其他地方用餐（食物很一般且非常昂貴），然後來這裡在甲板上喝一杯——在晴朗的夜晚可以欣賞到 101 和城市景觀的壯麗景色。  酒吧每人最低消費500元台幣。","Taiwan's services are usually poor, and this place is no exception.We book a large table at the 101 stall, but they provide a small table in the corner.We insist on the original table.The hostess reluctantly gave us.Her attitude is not good, lack of training, and needs to be improved.The server is also very slow and very unprofessional.Ironically, they charge 10%of service fees when the service is not good.If the service is good, I would rather pay 20%.Taiwan should implement a tip system like North America.

This place gets a star because of the good scenery.In fact, I suggest that you eat other places (the food is very general and very expensive), and then come here to drink a drink on the deck -you can enjoy the magnificent scenery of 101 and urban landscapes on a clear night.The minimum consumption of 500 yuan per person for a bar."
台北最值得一去的酒吧❤,The most worthwhile bar in Taipei ❤
"生活小撇步：信義的Morton's Steak House視野較好，而且不收取荒唐的8000新台幣坐在外面；中山雅樂軒酒店是景觀方面的有力競爭者，並且沒有這樣的最低收費。

在這家酒吧的經歷非常令人失望。當我們到達時，我們被告知大多數桌子都是“預訂的”，並且坐在一大群人旁邊的一些不舒服的沙發上（並不是真的有興趣聽到他們的談話）。雞尾酒還可以，不過我在台北（MOD、Washu）喝過更好的雞尾酒。有趣的是，我的派對在餐廳裡待了大約一個半小時，而「預訂」餐桌的顧客從未出現。","Life is a small step: Xinyi's Morton's Steak House has a good vision and does not charge the absurd 8,000 NT $; Zhongshan Yalex Hotel is a strong competitor in the landscape, and there is no such low fee.

The experience in this bar is very disappointing.When we arrived, we were told that most tables were ""reservations"" and we were sitting on some uncomfortable sofas next to a large group of people (not really interested in hearing their conversations).Cocktails are okay, but I have drank better cocktails in MOD, Washu.Interestingly, my party stayed in the restaurant for about an hour and a half, and customers at the ""booking"" dining table never appeared."
"冬夏雞尾酒🍹
金酒/梔子茶/百香果利口酒/金橘汁/蜂蜜/","Winter and summer cocktail 鸡
Golden Wine/Gardenia Tea/Passion Fluthard wine/golden orange juice/honey/"
環境很好，餐廳的全景也很漂亮。這是在特殊場合與您的愛人一起去的好地方。有最低支出但可以管理。,"The environment is very good, and the panoramic view of the restaurant is also very beautiful.This is a good place to go with your lover in special occasions.There is the lowest expenditure but can be managed."
我們有一群 15 個人，週日在萬豪酒店舉行婚禮後想來喝一杯。這個地方幾乎是空的，如果不承諾一個可笑的最低限度，他們就不會讓我們進去。他們說他們的員工不適合我們團隊。他們說露台天氣不好（事實確實如此）。不建議去這裡，因為女主人不聰明。當酒吧空蕩蕩的時候，為什麼不向 15 個人要錢呢？這對企業來說只是一種損失。傷心！,"We have a group of 15 people who want to have a drink after a wedding at the Marriott Hotel on Sunday.This place is almost empty. If they do not promise a ridiculous minimum, they will not let us go in.They said their employees are not suitable for our team.They said that the weather in the terrace was not good (the fact is true).It is not recommended to go here because the hostess is not smart.Why not ask for money from 15 people when the bar is empty?This is just a loss for enterprises.sad!"
用餐體驗非常愉快，氣氛舒適，還能欣賞到夜城的壯麗景色。,"The dining experience is very happy, the atmosphere is comfortable, and you can also enjoy the magnificent scenery of the night city."
從未有過如此糟糕的預訂經驗。酒吧只關心你穿什麼，並在網站上和打電話時不斷提醒/嘮叨。我猜它通常擠滿了衣著樸素的客人，或者它只是默認鄙視客人,"There has never been such a bad booking experience.The bar only cares about what you wear, and keep reminding/nagging on the website and when calling.I guess it is usually full of simple -dressed guests, or it just despise the guests by default"
晚上的景色再配上一杯酒，完美！,"The scenery at night is equipped with a glass of wine, perfect!"
夜景很棒，點了威士忌基飲料，味道不錯,"The night scene is great, ordered the whiskey base drink, the taste is good"
"美麗的景色和浪漫的氣氛
飲料是soso","Beautiful scenery and romantic atmosphere
The drink is soso"
"很高興看到101，還有戶外露臺。
缺點是有點吵。","I am glad to see 101, and outdoor terraces.
The disadvantage is a bit noisy."
這裡的食物很好，雖然看起來有點貴。我去的時候是自助餐形式，選擇範圍很廣，從煙燻鮭魚到小吃，再到薯條和湯。景色可能會很棒，只是正在下雨，所以窗戶上全是霧氣，沒人能看到外面。,"The food here is very good, although it looks a bit expensive.When I went, I was a buffet form, with a wide range of choices, from smoky salmon to snacks, to fries and soup.The scenery may be great, but it is raining, so the windows are all fog, no one can see the outside."
美麗的景色和優質的牛排。,Beautiful scenery and high -quality steak.
高級餐廳......美味的食物,Advanced restaurant ... delicious food
很棒的食物，很棒的體驗。糟糕的甜點，味道平淡無奇。堅持吃牛排，無論您坐在哪裡，都能欣賞到台北 101 大樓的美景。,"Great food, great experience.The bad dessert, the taste is bland.Persist in eating steaks, no matter where you sit, you can enjoy the beauty of Taipei 101 Building."
來這裡喝酒，非常高興。我會盡快再去一次。,"Come here to drink, very happy.I will go again as soon as possible."
"食物很美味，飲料也很棒
服務非常慢而且不專心
水費NT100，但只來了一次加水
套餐菜單項目比 Al lacart 來得快得多
生日本來應該有一個小鬆餅和飲料，但他們說因為我們昨天才預訂，所以沒有鬆餅。  問題是我們一週前就預訂了......沒什麼大不了的，因為我們只想為孩子吹熄小蠟燭
不屬於萬豪酒店，所以沒有折扣","The food is delicious and the drink is also great
The service is very slow and not concentrated
Water cost NT100, but only one time is here to add water
Package menu item is much faster than Al Lacart
There should be a small muffin and drink in Japan, but they said that because we booked it yesterday, there was no muffin.The problem is that we book a week ago ... It's not a big deal, because we just want to blow off a small candle for our children.
Not belonging to the Marriott Hotel, so there is no discount"
"I have never encountered this surprising experience that my soup is not served with one or two slices of bread! I have to order a large loaf and pay for it. I have dined in many Marriott rest and many grill rest . to face this new world?
從來沒有試過食西饗飲湯是沒有一二片麵包。這次我要買一條大麵包及另外付費。不是４５星級飯店及扒房所為。","I have never enCountered This Surprising Experience that my soup is not served with one or two Slices of Bread! I have to order a large and pay for it. in Many Marriott and Many Grill Rest. To face this new world What's more?
There has never been a piece of bread in Xiyu drink soup.This time I want to buy a large bread and pay separately.It is not a 45 -star restaurant and a piercing house."
絕佳的城市夜景。良好的氛圍。綜合飲酒清單。,Excellent city night scene.A good atmosphere.Comprehensive drinking list.
很好的創意雞尾酒，美味的食物，美麗的景色，便宜的價格！,"Good creative cocktails, delicious food, beautiful scenery, cheap price!"
用於娛樂。這是萬豪酒店頂樓的酒吧和燒烤店。當然，即使您不是飯店客人也可以使用。露台很大，晚上的景色很壯觀。烤龍蝦的美味給我留下了深刻的印象。您可以在露台上吸煙。有服裝要求，例如不得穿短褲或涼鞋。即使不是西裝或洋裝也沒關係。也許適合約會或娛樂。,"Used for entertainment.This is the bar and barbecue restaurant on the top floor of the Marriott Hotel.Of course, you can use it even if you are not a hotel guest.The terrace is very large, and the scenery at night is spectacular.The deliciousness of roasted lobster left a deep impression on me.You can smoke on the terrace.There are clothing requirements, such as not to wear shorts or sandals.It doesn't matter if it is not a suit or dress.Maybe suitable for dating or entertainment."
"早午餐選項的價格高得離譜。
食物很好，景色也不錯。然而，我不知道我是否會選擇去這裡並自掏腰包。","The price of brunch options is highly outrageous.
The food is very good and the scenery is good.However, I don't know if I would choose to go here and pay my pocket."
美味的食物和美麗的景色,Delicious food and beautiful scenery
服務團隊很差，食物很糟糕，管理很差，而且價格很高，這就是你從台北萬豪酒店的這家餐廳得到的。我們帶著很高的期望來到這裡，真的很期待這個慶祝活動，最後，感覺慶祝活動被取消了。  從可笑的座位安排到非常低品質的食物，不值錢！即使你向餐廳經理投訴，他也無動於衷。萬豪會員這裡就不值一提了…,"The service team is very poor, the food is bad, the management is poor, and the price is very high. This is what you got from the restaurant from the Marriott Hotel in Taipei.We came here with high expectations. I really looked forward to this celebration. Finally, I felt that the celebration was canceled.From the ridiculous seats to very low -quality food, it is not worth it!Even if you complain to the restaurant manager, he is indifferent.Members of Marriott are worthless here ..."
美麗的景色和美味的食物,Beautiful scenery and delicious food
酒吧可欣賞風景。天氣宜人時，露天座位很不錯。可以欣賞附近摩天輪的美景。日落時分去欣賞傍晚的天空。,"You can enjoy the scenery.When the weather is pleasant, the open -air seat is very good.You can enjoy the beauty of the nearby Ferris wheel.To enjoy the evening sky at sunset."
光是夜景就值得了！,It's worth the night scene!
總的來說，體驗很不錯，但我希望他們演奏更多有趣的音樂，以將氣氛保持在一個新的水平。,"In general, the experience is very good, but I hope they can play more interesting music to keep the atmosphere at a new level."
食物很好，景色很美，但我希望女服務員會提到水不是免費的，特別是因為我們已經點了飲料。,"The food is very good and the scenery is beautiful, but I hope that the female waiter will mention that water is not free, especially because we have already ordered drinks."
美味的雞尾酒，戶外的城市景觀！,"Delicious cocktails, outdoor urban landscapes!"
美女場景,Beauty scene
"台北、標誌性的 101 大樓和周圍山脈的美景！
一流的食物、服務和氣氛。
舉辦特別慶祝活動的完美場所。","The beauty of Taipei, iconic 101 buildings and surrounding mountains!

好酒+美景,Good wine+beautiful scenery
可以看到台北市的美景，座位很多，飲料和食物也很好。,"You can see the beauty of Taipei City, there are many seats, and drinks and foods are also very good."
"飯菜還可以
它有一個酒吧，景色很棒。
下次想試試二樓的鐵板燒。","Out of food

不錯的飯店餐廳。能欣賞台北市景和松山機場的美景，真是難得，而且燒烤的食物和雞尾酒也很美味。,"Good restaurant and restaurant.It is really rare to enjoy the beauty of Taipei City and Songshan Airport, and barbecue foods and cocktails are also delicious."
不錯的地方，除了他們應該有 500 TWD。當你真正在那裡時，最少會變成一千。即使座位還沒滿，他們也會要求你和陌生人坐在一起,"A good place, except for them to have 500 TWD.When you are really there, at least one thousand.Even if the seat is not full, they will ask you to sit with strangers"

很響。景色不錯。最低購買額高。好服務,Very loud.The scenery is good.The lowest purchase amount is high.Good service
雖然這個地方可以看到台北的美景，而且偶爾氣氛也不錯，但飲料和食物很貴，而且服務也不是很好。,"Although this place can be seen in the beauty of Taipei, and occasionally the atmosphere is good, but the drinks and food are expensive, and the service is not very good."
雞尾酒確實不錯，有自己的風格。最好晚上去，可以看到城市景觀。,Cocktails are really good and have their own style.It is best to go at night and you can see the city landscape.
