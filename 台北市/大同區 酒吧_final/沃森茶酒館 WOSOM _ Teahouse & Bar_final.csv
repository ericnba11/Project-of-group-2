"只是想來回味一下英國味，所以對餐點沒有太大的期待，當我咬一口熱壓吐司，酥軟的口感稍微安慰了我的味蕾，再咬一口白酒醋漬內餡的強烈酸嗆感有點嚇到我了，但還是能夠整份吃完，堅果外觀沒有明顯烘烤色澤，咬起來微鹹清脆，優格也是偏酸的，配一點果醬剛剛好，反而是附餐的錫蘭紅茶表現的中規中矩，不苦不澀，淡淡茶香，正好把口中酸味沖掉。
空間不大，座位間隔很近，很難不聽進隔壁桌貴婦如何規劃歐洲自由行的過程，還有17天吃的總共花了三萬多台幣，所以比較適合逛累了小歇一下，安靜的喝杯茶、補充熱量就好。","I just want to look back and forth, so I don't have much expectation for the meal.

整體環境很棒，食物種類不多，但是飲品的選項很豐富也有很多變化，鹹食部分加上服務費後價格偏高，若是想要享受喝茶的氛圍建議可以點小點心，座位數量不多，僅有吧台處三個座位有插座。以整體價位來說，茶不能回沖，所以扣一分。,"The overall environment is great, there are not many types of food, but the options of drinks are very rich and there are a lot of changes.

"整體來說cp值不高。雖然環境很優美，很安靜讓人放鬆，但餐點費用偏高，而且內容也很失望。特別是那個鯷魚三明治，整塊吐司裡面只有兩隻小鯷魚，真的讓人非常失望（如圖）。

雖然餐點的費用偏高，但是飲料費用比較高，我覺得茶葉的品質還算不錯。如果只是來這裡坐坐，享受一下環境，再點一杯茶或咖啡也是不錯的選擇。但如果想要來這裡用餐，建議大家可能可以再考慮其他選擇，因為餐點的cp值不高，而且也沒有太多驚喜的地方。

總結來說，這家咖啡廳的環境很優美，飲料的茶葉品質不錯，但是餐點的內容真的很廢，尤其是鯷魚三明治。如果只是來這裡坐坐，喝杯茶或咖啡，那這裡還算是不錯的選擇。但是如果想要用餐，那可能需要考慮其他選擇。","On the whole, the CP value is not high.Although the environment is beautiful, quiet and relaxed, the meal cost is high, and the content is also disappointed.Especially the catfish sandwiches, there are only two small catfish in the whole toast, which is really disappointing (as shown in the figure).

I think the quality of tea is pretty good.If you just come here to sit here, enjoy the environment, and order a cup of tea or coffee is also a good choice.But if you want to come here for dinner, it is recommended that you can consider other choices, because the CP value of the meal is not high, and there are not many surprises.

In summary, the environment of this cafe is very beautiful, and the quality of the tea is good, but the content of the meal is really wasteful, especially the orangus sandwiches.If you just come here to sit here and drink a cup of tea or coffee, then it is a good choice.But if you want to eat, you may need to consider other choices.",False,0.128,0.017,0.855,0.951

店內不大，所以即便客滿也不會太嘈雜。一櫃的書牆很吸引人的目光，剛看完色戒來這家咖啡廳瞬間也感受到了年代的重量，司康軟硬適中，搭配奶酪、青檸兩種醬，濃郁爽口並陳，再配上無糖紅茶，不失為一個涵養心神的快樂午後。鹹點就沒有那麼令人喜歡了，下次來可能會吃飽再來品嚐司康。,"The store is not big, so even if it is full, it will not be too noisy.The book wall of a cabinet is very attractive.

"在迪化街辦貨其實很累人，走得累找個地方歇腳喝個咖啡是常識吧，本應去一間想要去好幾次但都沒去的咖啡廳，到了卻發現隔鄰是一間主打用茶做調酒的茶室，然後就給吸進去了。

茶室樓底高，木製陳設，放滿書的書櫃，給人一種古舊西歐書院的氣息。酒單有多種以茶跟琴酒調配的調酒，還有各種加入本地茶釀製的茶酒，旁邊的一群客人都點了用上紅酒杯的熱茶酒，好像蠻好喝的，但我跟那個人都走路走得有點熱，還是點了兩杯冰的降降溫。

綠之島跟紅之島用料大致上一樣，分別在綠茶跟紅茶，威士忌跟百蘭地，味道方面，綠之島的層次跟味道，都比紅之島突出，既清爽又帶酒香，茶味依然明顯，酒味沒有很濃，很適合下午小酌一杯，很是舒壓。缺點還是有的，就是杯小了點，價錢貴了點吧。","It is actually tiring to run the goods in Dihua Street. It is common sense to go to find a place to take a place to drink a coffee. I should have been to a coffee shop who wants to go several times but did not go. The main tea room was used to use tea, and then sucked in.

The bottom of the tea room is high, wooden furnishings, and bookcases full of books, giving a breath of ancient Western European academies.There are a variety of wine lists arranged by tea and piano wine, as well as various tea wine made from local tea. A group of guests next to it ordered the hot tea wine with red wine glasses. But I and that person and I walked a little hot, and I ordered two cups of ice to cool down.

Green Island is roughly the same as the materials of the Red Island. In terms of green tea and black tea, whiskey and Bailan, the taste, the layers and taste of the green island are more prominent than the Red Island, both refreshing and wine.

另外也點了下午茶套餐，友人說司康偏濕，不過我自己蠻喜歡的，起司醬的部分很愛。","The atmosphere is good and the tea is delicious. It is very good tea and wine restaurant. It is very suitable to talk about the sky in the afternoon and three or five friends.

#鯷魚三明治很特別但份量少
#紅茶品質我喜歡

前一天明明兩人在大稻埕逛了一下午，但早上起床後討論討論就決定來這家昨天看上有趣的店來吃早午餐。
整體來說是我個人喜歡的店，整體餐點品質有中上水準，裝潢非常英倫風，剛好一早店內只有我們兩個人，讓我除了能享受一頓很不錯的早午餐之外，還能好好靜下心來看一下小說。

The day before, the two visited the Dadaocheng for the afternoon, but after getting up in the morning, the discussion was decided to come to this shop that looked at the interesting shop yesterday for brunch.
Overall is my personal favorite store. The overall meal quality has the middle and upper levels, and the decoration is very British style. Just early in the morning, there were only two of us in the shop. In addition to enjoying a very good brunch, I can also be good. Take a calm look at the novel.

這位女士說沒有座位，即使後面有一張四人桌，我們也沒有足夠的人。不久之後我們就離開了。
她的態度很勢利，事實上他們拒絕一位顧客只是為了他們可以用他們擁有的椅子填滿所有桌子，這是非常不專業的。

The lady said that there was no seat, even if there was a four -person table in the back, we had not enough people.Soon we left.
