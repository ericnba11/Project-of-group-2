心得：

我在Google 地圖尋找木柵的義式餐廳，出現了Purrson Bistro，作為年資僅近40的木柵人，我其實假日很少在自家周邊用餐 #假日總想要出去吃，所以對木柵的餐廳也不是很熟，也覺得木柵沒有什麼網紅名店。

要是看好了公車時刻，#呼嚕小酒館 對我們家來說還滿方便的，在巷口搭公車，然後在店門口下車，用餐後在對面回程。他店就在大馬路邊，反正我前後是沒有看到任何停車場，也不建議大家開車來。#把開車拿掉

店內移動的方式還挺可愛的。從大馬路邊上走樓梯往下，進入室內之後帶位往二樓走，然後你坐在一樓的室內，旁邊有一個大門，可以從那裡看到大馬路，但它純裝飾，不是進出的入口，店內的座位並不是很多，一樓有唯一的一張桌子，二樓有六張4-6人桌。

點餐方式是掃碼點餐，結帳方式是現金，不收服務費，我是第二組客人，因為餐廳的位置還滿偏的，本來以為不會再有客人，結果竟然客滿。
#而且好多人都是第一次來

說實話我覺得這三道菜都還好，網友太會拍照了，我還以為 #炸阿根廷巨魷佐塔塔 是多大一份，上來就小小的，還好我們只有兩個人，沒吃幾口就結束了，價錢有點不ok，塔塔醬還滿好吃的。

2. 超濃奶油培根義大利麵
培根奶蛋面小朋友應該會喜歡，一般的奶蛋麵都會偏鹹，他們家偏甜，醬汁還滿厚的，上面的水波蛋有點過熟了，然後真的是一個沒有味道的水波蛋。

3. 德國豬腳
豬腳加上配菜、還有薯條，還滿像回事的，但也就還好，德國豬腳也不太可能不好吃，薯條炸得還不錯。

我覺得如果點前菜作為主餐，小酌應該是相當不錯的選擇。

#氣溫影響食慾
看得出，我對這家店的評價不高，一半的原因是因為很熱。店家開了冷氣也開了電風扇，但就是一直都不涼，因為餐廳是我找的，媽媽不好說什麼，但他從頭到尾都拿扇子，我沒有去跟店家反應，覺得也不會有改善，但真的很熱，我大概是在28的室溫下吃飯的，而我覺得現在的28度並不適合吃飯。

是否適合聚餐：不推薦

Address: No. 106, Section 2, Guide Road Road, Wenshan District, Taipei City
MRT Station: No
Parking lot: If you can't find it, you should be able to stop at Zhengda University, but it's too far from walking.

Service: Care
Seat: spacious

Experience:

I was looking for a Wagu -style restaurant in Google Map. Purrson Bistro appeared. As a wooden man with only nearly 40 years of age, I actually rarely eat on the surroundings of my own on holidays. The restaurant is not very familiar, I also feel that Muzha has no famous Internet celebrity shops.

If you are optimistic about the bus,#要 要 要 is still convenient for our home. Take a bus at the alley and get off at the door of the store.His shop is on the side of Morida. Anyway, I did not see any parking lots before and after, and it is not recommended that everyone drive.#把 把

The way to move in the store is quite cute.Take the stairs from the side of the road, enter the room, take the seat to the second floor, and then sit in the room on the first floor. There is a gate next to you. You can see the road from there, but it is purely decorated, not in and out of At the entrance, there are not many seats in the store. There are only tables on the first floor, and there are six 4-6 tables on the second floor.

The method of ordering is to scan the code and order meal. The checkout method is cash. I do n’t collect the service fee. I am the second group of guests. Because the restaurant is still full, I thought that there would be no guests, but it turned out to be full.
#And many people are here for the first time

To be honest, I think these three dishes are okay. Netizens will take pictures too much. I think#说 说 说 说 说 说 说 说 说 说 is small. Fortunately, we only have two people. The mouth is over, the price is a bit OK, and the Tata sauce is delicious.

2. Ultra -thick creamy bacon Italian noodles
Bacon milk noodles should like it. Generally, the milk egg noodles will be salty, their homes are sweet, the sauce is full, the water wave eggs above are a bit cooked, and then it is really a tasteless water wave egg.

3. German pig feet
Pig feet with side dishes and fries are full of things, but it is okay, German pig feet are unlikely not to be delicious, and the fries fried well.

I think that if you order the previous dish as the main meal, drinking should be a pretty good choice.

#Temperature affects appetite
It can be seen that my evaluation of this store is not high, because half of the reason is very hot.The store turned on the air -conditioning and turned on the electric fan, but it was not cold, because the restaurant was found, and the mother couldn't say anything, but he took a fan from beginning to end. I improve, but it is really hot. I eat at about 28 room temperature, and I think the current 28 degrees is not suitable for eating.

Is it suitable for dinner: not recommended
You can score a few points for full score: 6.9 points
Will you recommend friends: No"

"很開心木柵有親子+寵物餐廳，可以帶五個寶貝一起來吃飯❤️庭院有小朋友可以玩的吊椅，還有狗狗可以跑的草地，在等餐點的時候他們都玩到太開心不想進來吃飯了呢🤣

我們3大2小點了：無酒精特調「龍柱回桃」、黑糖奶蓋奶茶、蔬菜湯、田園時蔬、奶油菠菜濃湯、普羅旺斯燉菜、法式干貝燉飯、紅醬鮮蝦義大利麵、棉花糖麻糬鬆餅🎉

他們的特調真的是非常的華麗浮誇！竟然還有一整艘龍舟跟乾冰耶🥰小孩們從來沒有看過這樣的飲料，都覺得非常的有趣～而且他們超愛吃鬆餅的，上面還有很多裝飾的棒棒糖，就可以讓他們三個小孩ㄧ人一隻，邊吃邊玩得不亦樂乎‼️

平常最愛吃義大利麵的我，覺得他們的餐點都很道地，海鮮也都很新鮮～普羅旺斯燉菜裡面還有我沒有吃過的蔬菜，實在是讓人印象深刻😄","I am very happy that there are parent -child+pet restaurants, you can bring five treasures to eat together ❤️ There are hanging chairs that children can play in the courtyard, and grass that can run by dogs. When they are waiting for meals, they are too happy to have fun. Come in for dinner 了

We have 3 big and 2 small points: no alcoholic ""dragon pillar back to peach"", brown sugar milk tea milk tea, vegetable soup, pastoral vegetable vegetables, cream spinach soup, Provence stew, French scallop stew, red sauce fresh shrimp Italian Italian Italian Italian Italian Italy Noodles, cotton candy hemp pine cakes 🎉

Their special tunes are really gorgeous and exaggerated!There are still a whole dragon boat and dried Bingye children who have never seen such drinks, and they all feel very interesting ~ and they love to eat muffins. There are many decorative lollipops on it to make them three. One child, playing while eating, you're happy‼️ ️

I usually like Italian noodles the most, I think their meals are very authentic, and seafood is also very fresh ~ There are vegetables I have not eaten in Provence stew."

雖然不能從一樓進出比較不方便，但白酒蛤蜊義大利麵是少數吃到可以將白酒味道融入麵體的，麵條Q度也適中，其他餐點和甜點也都是有特色且好吃的，雖然價格稍貴，但是對的上餐點品質的👍🏻,"Although it is inconvenient to enter and exit from the first floor, but a small number of liquor clams and the Italian noodles can be eaten by a few that can integrate the flavor of liquor into the facade. The noodles are also moderate. The price is slightly more expensive, but the quality of the right meal is 👍🏻"

氣氛佳～紅醬鮮蝦義大利麵好吃,氣氛佳～紅醬鮮蝦義大利麵好吃
"現場氣氛很好，裝飾很不錯，很符合網紅熱門打卡景點，唯一可惜的與路平行的門無法進入，所以需要走陡峭的樓梯向下，對行動不便的老人和帶嬰兒車很不便。

停車位置需要找尋路邊停車，以台北來講停車位難求，店前有站牌，公車可以直達，算是彌補這不足的部分。

價格以台北來說是正常，但以學區來說價格偏高，想想餐點不難吃，且擺盤和裝飾用心，算是對的起這個價格。

適合生日，聚餐，或是平時來用餐的好地方。","The atmosphere at the scene was very good, the decoration was very good, and it was in line with the popular punching of the Internet celebrity. The only pity that the door parallel to the road could not enter, so it was necessary to take the steep stairs downward, and it was inconvenient to take the elderly and a baby car with inconvenient operations.

The parking location needs to be found on the roadside parking. In Taipei, the parking space is difficult to find. There are stop signs in front of the store and the bus can be directly reached.

The price is normal for Taipei, but the price is high in the school district. It is not difficult to think about meals, and it is the right price.

Suitable for birthdays, dinner, or a good place to eat."

很好吃，但價格偏高，適合來慶祝紀念日還是生日來吃，義大利麵跟燉飯偏硬口感，喜歡軟一點口感的朋友要特別在點餐時，特別備註一下。特別推薦牛排義大利麵及蔓越莓麻糬司康～,"It is delicious, but the price is high. It is suitable for celebrating the anniversary or birthday. The pasta and stewed rice are stiff. Friends who like a soft taste should specifically pay attention when ordering.Special recommendations for steaks and cranberry Masaki ~"
"母親節老公找的這間位在指南路的餐酒館，不得不說老公很會選店，母親節帶我跟鵝子來這家離我們家不遠，位在木柵這邊的餐廳吃大餐，他們店的入口有一個戶外用餐區看起來非常chill，第一個感覺他應該是親子餐廳吧！但並不僅只而已，沒想到的是它大白天就開賣精緻調酒然後一直營業到晚上12：00的一家餐酒館唷！這竟然開在文山區真的很另類啊！重點是餐點非常好吃，通常我對於這種景觀餐廳餐食幾乎抱著只要不要太貴，不難吃就可以了，但一上菜，不誇張我鵝子這個吃貨，還有我這個嘴刁鬼，真的有被每一道給驚豔到，今天點的不管是主餐還是甜點還是調酒都沒讓人失望，天啊！原來木柵竟然有這種視覺與味覺兼顧的小酒館啊！太驚奇了！好餐廳一定要推薦，文山美食不能亡，支持在地美味店家，希望大家有機會可以去品嚐看看喔！
今天點的餐點：
摩洛哥燉雞柳番茄鍋（番茄味道非常濃厚，雞柳很入味，加上半熟蛋黃沾大蒜麵包....喔買尬的真的超讚der)
奶油明太子海鮮義大利麵(奶油香氣搭配上噗滋噗滋的明太子裹在軟硬適中的義大利麵條上，跟滿滿的海鮮真是非常的配，底下醬汁更帶點微微的辣感，奶香吃起來不膩口海鮮也很新鮮，推薦海鮮控一定要吃！
芝士奶醬焗烤生蠔（這也是海鮮控必點之一，主要是生蠔夠新鮮，焗烤並沒有把它焗老了，吃起來超極啾喜的！然後一定要趁熱跟那個牽絲奶焗一起吃，實在太誘人了，一邊打字一邊已經在懷念那個味道。）
甜點：
焦糖香草生乳布丁（店家自煮的焦糖非常香，大人系苦甜的口感搭配充滿奶香蛋香的綿密布丁，值得推薦！
蜂蜜莓果麻糬鬆餅（這個我鵝子吃到欲霸不能拍了很多他很饞的醜照😂🤣😂，外皮超酥脆裡面有牽絲麻糬，淋上蜂蜜撒上莓果果乾，甜度很剛好，加上果乾酸酸甜甜外皮脆脆內餡QQ軟糯，如果有小朋友真的一下就被掃光了。）
調酒：
風韻奶媽
濃郁的奶酒風味，酒體已經感覺呈現奶露狀，入口很順口，酒跟奶的比例調的將將好，乾燥玫瑰花帶著淡淡花香氣，融合在一起滋味特別好，是我喜歡的口感。）
三個願望
（一上來那個神燈冒著煙，非常有阿拉丁的那種中東感覺，這是我老公點的，我只有淺嚐一小口，酒味對我來說比較重一點點，不過是有酒量基礎的人會蠻愛的口味！）","This restaurant and tavern for Mother's Day in the road of Guide Road. I have to say that my husband will choose the shop. Mother's Day takes me and goosezi to this family. It is not far from our family. Meals, there is an outdoor dining area at the entrance of their restaurant looks very chill. The first one feels that he should be a parent -child restaurant!But it's not just just. I didn't expect it to sell exquisite bartender during the day and then open until 12:00 pm.This is really different in Wenshan District!The point is that the meal is very delicious. Usually I almost hold this kind of landscape restaurant meal, as long as it is not too expensive, it is not difficult to eat, but as soon as it is served, I don’t exaggerate my goose. Diaoling, there is really no stunning by every way. Whether it is the main meal, dessert or bartending today, it is not disappointing. Oh my god!It turns out that Muzha actually has this kind of tavern with both visual and taste!It's surprising!Good restaurants must be recommended. Wenshan cuisine cannot be killed. Support the local delicious shops. I hope everyone can have the opportunity to taste it!
Meal today:
Morocco stewed chicken willow tomato pot (tomato tastes very strong, chicken willow is very delicious, plus half -cooked egg yolk with garlic bread ... oh buy is really superb)
Cream Ming Prince Seafood Pasta (Cream aroma is matched with the nourishing Prince Ming Prince Wrapped on the soft and hard Italian noodles. It is really very good with the full seafood. The fragrant taste is also very fresh. It is recommended that seafood control must be eaten!
Cheese milk sauce grilled oysters (This is also one of the must -have seafood controls, mainly because the oysters are fresh enough, and the grilled grilled is not old, and it is superhuman! Then be sure Eat together, it's too seductive, I am missing that taste while typing.)
dessert:
Caramel vanilla raw cream pudding (The caramel cooked by the store is very fragrant. The bitterness of adults is a dense pudding full of milk flavor, which is worth recommending!
Honey berry pine pine pine pine pine (this goose son eats it, you can't take a lot of ugly photos that he is very much, the outer skin is super crispy with silk hemp inside, drizzle with honey and sprinkle with dried berries, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness, sweetness. It is just right, plus dried and sour, sweet, sweet and crispy filling QQ soft and glutinous, if there are children, it will be swept away.)
Bartending:
Charm
The strong milk wine flavor, the wine body has felt milk -shaped, the entrance is very smooth, the proportion of wine and milk will be well adjusted, and the dry roses will have a light flower aroma. Essence.
Three wishes
(When the god lamp came up, the magic lamp was cigarette, which was very Aladdin's Middle East feeling. This is my husband's order. I only have a small taste. The taste of the wine is a bit heavier, but it is a basis People will love the taste!"
清炒海鮮溫沙拉跟法式干貝義大利燉飯都好吃；白酒蛤蜊義大利麵也好食，可惜加了辣椒孩子覺得辣，媽媽賺到美味卻多了肥肉。餐具餐盤有講究、質感不錯！,清炒海鮮溫沙拉跟法式干貝義大利燉飯都好吃；白酒蛤蜊義大利麵也好食，可惜加了辣椒孩子覺得辣，媽媽賺到美味卻多了肥肉。餐具餐盤有講究、質感不錯！

The garlic bread is fluttering spinach and New Orleans, and two Bennyk eggs are placed at the top.There are also salads and fries on the plate, which is the American fries I like very much!Frying it is crispy.

"因為當天和朋友一起去了動物園才知道附近有一間這麼棒的餐廳，地點完全不適合搭大眾交通工具來，但食物真的好好吃👍🏻
餐廳外觀很美，來的時間剛好還有點光可以拍到漂亮的戶外，外面的串燈也很有氣氛🫶🏻
室內空間較狹小離其他桌子有一點近，可能生意太好覺得說話回音有點大聲。
廁所位置在陽台的地方，一點點不方便但可以接受，室內很美，很多可愛的小東西讓整體用餐感受加了不少分。
點餐方式有點不方便，需要加入line好友，算是這次用餐最不喜歡的部分，希望能用更方便的方式點餐。
餐點的部分每道我們都喜歡，下次還能有機會會再來訪💕💕💕","因為當天和朋友一起去了動物園才知道附近有一間這麼棒的餐廳，地點完全不適合搭大眾交通工具來，但食物真的好好吃👍🏻

"整體用餐體驗非常棒🌹
已經是三次造訪！餐點非常用心，環境也溫馨。點番紅花雞肉串燉飯、辣味海鮮義大利麵、水牛城雞翅～
以政大附近商圈價錢來說，CP可說非常高，
味道非常有層次，吃起來也很有滿足。
是第三次用餐，覺得風味有些改變，比較濕，也不那麼入味…有跟店家反應，店員人也非常好。希望可以找回原來當初用餐時的那種驚豔！
一開始訂位在戶外用餐，但有一點點煙味，跟店家反應，店家立刻將我們換到室內空間！會再度光臨👏","整體用餐體驗非常棒🌹

店內裝潢蠻溫馨舒適的，今天點的餐點每道都獲得好評。不過炸物不夠酥脆，有點稍嫌油膩，其餘的餐點（燉飯、義大利麵、沙拉）都很好吃，大人小孩都喜歡。是個適合家庭聚餐朋友聚會的好所在！","The door of the store is not easy to find, it is easy to miss it.

"剛好與政大社資中心隔一道牆，不仔細看，還真不知道這裡有間餐廳。個人覺得用餐氛圍非常棒，再加上店員服務非常熱心，是間非常適合聚餐小聊的餐酒館。

不過點餐是用手機點餐，介面也頗複雜，對3C弱勢族群不太友善。外加點餐完畢後，網頁頁面如果沒有另存，其實會不知道自己點了什麼，也不知道總價錢。而店員也這麼剛好漏掉餐點，若非自己有記得某道餐點沒上，否則會等到天荒地老（但店員有送上一杯奶茶致意，在此給個讚！）。

而餐點美味程度普普，就是非常保守的義大利麵、燉飯，價位也偏高、份量一般般，若沒有點其他小點心，其實很難吃飽。但本間餐廳還是適合飲酒、小聊，甚至還有水煙可以抽，實在是太chill了！

反正政大附近就是美食沙漠，能在這處沙漠種下綠洲，都要給店家一個respect！","剛好與政大社資中心隔一道牆，不仔細看，還真不知道這裡有間餐廳。個人覺得用餐氛圍非常棒，再加上店員服務非常熱心，是間非常適合聚餐小聊的餐酒館。

The last time I came in the afternoon, it seems that there is only a sweet snack left
And many of them are sold out!
I want to eat salty and salty, I leave!Intersection

"店家附近不太好停車，無論騎車或開車前往都要稍微繞一段才能找到車位。

餐點價格中上，套餐CP值很低，因為加價不少，但湯只有一點點而且超鹹，鹹到我們都跟服務生詢問熱水自己加來稀釋...... 套餐沙拉的份量也超少，內容物也很普通，連杯飲料都沒有，覺得可以不用加套餐可能內心感受會好一點～

主食點義大利麵，味道還不錯，是好吃的，友人的早午餐也算美味","店家附近不太好停車，無論騎車或開車前往都要稍微繞一段才能找到車位。

"一直記著要上來評論，因為實在難得吃到讓我想下筆一定要推推的店家

上次來已經是一個多月前了，還是有夠念念不忘
那天從傍晚坐到22點多，看著店員一直走來走去，感覺的出來平日生意也很好~幸好有早早訂位😁

但雖然店員都超忙，不過還是有很細心的關心到我們有沒有吃飽，需不需要上甜點了~而且經過時看到有空盤也都會幫忙收拾桌子，重點沒收服務費👍
(偷偷的說都是帥哥美女店員欸)👈這點超加分 哈哈哈哈

本來對網美店的餐點抱持著應該就普普通通的心態，所以原本只是打算隨便點個甜點拍拍照就走，但看著旁邊桌上的菜好誘人，想說反正也差不多到了晚餐時間，猶豫了一下決定直接在這邊吃晚餐，結果...一個不小心和朋友們點滿了桌子XD
📌oh對~點餐是掃QRcode直接線上點，覺得對我們這種經常聊一句就忘記重點又有選擇困難的人很可以，不會讓店員等太久自己也不好意思😅

我沒想的是到從飲料、下酒菜、主餐、甜點都很Hen好吃Hen意外餒!!
尤其那個甜點檸檬老奶奶跟焦糖香草生乳布丁超讚我的愛👍
直接打翻了平常網美店的刻板印象~~~難怪大家桌上都滿滿的

而且氣氛超好~是朋友聚會的好選擇~

那天從傍晚坐到22點多，看著店員一直走來走去，感覺的出來平日生意也很好~幸好有早早訂位😁

但雖然店員都超忙，不過還是有很細心的關心到我們有沒有吃飽，需不需要上甜點了~而且經過時看到有空盤也都會幫忙收拾桌子，重點沒收服務費👍
(偷偷的說都是帥哥美女店員欸)👈這點超加分 哈哈哈哈

本來對網美店的餐點抱持著應該就普普通通的心態，所以原本只是打算隨便點個甜點拍拍照就走，但看著旁邊桌上的菜好誘人，想說反正也差不多到了晚餐時間，猶豫了一下決定直接在這邊吃晚餐，結果...一個不小心和朋友們點滿了桌子XD
📌oh對~點餐是掃QRcode直接線上點，覺得對我們這種經常聊一句就忘記重點又有選擇困難的人很可以，不會讓店員等太久自己也不好意思😅

我沒想的是到從飲料、下酒菜、主餐、甜點都很Hen好吃Hen意外餒!!
尤其那個甜點檸檬老奶奶跟焦糖香草生乳布丁超讚我的愛👍
直接打翻了平常網美店的刻板印象~~~難怪大家桌上都滿滿的

而且氣氛超好~是朋友聚會的好選擇~
這完全是絕對值得讓人回訪的店家啊🤤🤤🤤
有機會一定還要再去!!!"
"結論：環境氛圍不錯，但食物很慘。

一道380$的義大利麵，醬被收太乾，麵條乾又斷，很像放隔天加熱那樣，底盤很油，沒香氣。
螃蟹炸得厚又濕軟，味道帶有腥味，沒有吃到新鮮，吃完有點噁心。
-
濃湯雖然很濃，但吃了好幾塊沒攪拌開的麵粉，但蛤蜊味道很淡、沒什麼香氣和鮮味，還吃到「一條塑膠」還有沙子。
反應後說那碗不用錢，感覺上不是很好，有種好像貪省那筆，感受不到歉意，也沒得到正式的道歉。
-
燉飯乾硬，醬汁沒有進去，也沒有醬料的香氣，但相較湯鮮味明顯一些，但在口中渣的感覺有點重。
-
司康很普通，沒有麵粉香氣，絕多數都是果乾的味道，中間有層濕潤的醬，稍微讓司康好吃一些附上的手工果醬相較有誠意，但起士片也很普通。
-
布丁大概是裡面分數最高的，該有的香氣綿密度都很好，焦糖也苦味掌握的剛好，除了脱模有點醜，外型略破碎，但至少味道是好的。
-
卡布上桌前就溢出不少在杯盤上，杯子拿起來還會滴咖啡，溢出的兩要兩張紙巾才擦得乾，店員只有說很滿要小心，但沒有要把溢出來的擦掉。
味道不如何，澀味很重，吞下去還會維持很久。
-
奶茶底部很甜，沒特別提醒要攪拌開，拌開後有比較順口
-
整體來說除了環境跟布丁，其他餐點都不行，價格並不是太便宜，餐點品質又不是很好。

建議義大利麵跟燉飯都不用加上螃蟹，380$好好把義大利麵做好就好，為了成本兩個都做不好，顧客自然覺得貴，而且海鮮吃起來新鮮度很低，再認真把食物拍美，那個味道也美味不起來。","結論：環境氛圍不錯，但食物很慘。

"附近不好停車，建議停在萬興國小地下停車場，步行過去只需將近10分鐘。
餐廳裝潢很有歐式鄉村小酒館的氛圍，有樓上和樓下的座位，但假日人多還是建議先訂位。
餐點整體口味還OK，尤其飲料和甜點很適合拍照。

照片餐點：
- 墨西哥炸魚塔可
- 墨魚花枝細扁麵
- 粉紅玫瑰梭達
- 焦糖香草生乳布丁","附近不好停車，建議停在萬興國小地下停車場，步行過去只需將近10分鐘。

空間雖不大，但座位不擁擠，環境悠閒有許多別緻的小裝飾。早午餐份量足，口味好吃但未有驚艷，咖啡還不錯，美中不足的是單價偏高。,空間雖不大，但座位不擁擠，環境悠閒有許多別緻的小裝飾。早午餐份量足，口味好吃但未有驚艷，咖啡還不錯，美中不足的是單價偏高。
"進入餐廳前要從旁邊的樓梯走下來
會先到一個以白色柵欄跟戶外燈串佈置的小庭院 再進入餐廳

由於當天沒有先訂位 被安排在一樓(地下)大木桌
環境氛圍愜意慵懶 以白色為底
並有一些特別的古物擺設 我自己蠻喜歡這種風格

餐點部分
法式乾煎干貝燉飯：干貝煎得恰到好處 燉飯味道嚐起來像有醬汁的薑黃飯 味道不是太重有淡淡香氣

摩洛哥夏卡蘇卡燉番茄鍋：番茄鍋裡有燉雞、菇類、半熟蛋
孜然香氣配上微酸番茄醬汁很好吃
或許因為料理的方式關係 雞肉口感稍微有些乾
不過雞肉本身埋在醬汁裡 配著醬吃還算順口

旁邊附的大蒜麵包香味也很濃郁
若是口味較清淡的人 番茄鍋建議可以搭配麵包一起吃 單吃番茄鍋可能會偏鹹
（我本人是重口味 直接吃很爽😂）

其實原本不知道這家小酒館 人在附近臨時起意剛好找到就來了

"原本不愛吃寬麵，但這家的細扁麵味道做得很棒，辣和鹹的比例剛剛好，味道不錯也蠻特別。炸花枝的份量很大，味道也不錯。奶油蘑菇濃湯稍微鹹了點。總體4顆星以上。

另一部分讓我驚艷的是餐廳的環境，政大附近有這樣的餐廳，總體上還是蠻驚喜的。","原本不愛吃寬麵，但這家的細扁麵味道做得很棒，辣和鹹的比例剛剛好，味道不錯也蠻特別。炸花枝的份量很大，味道也不錯。奶油蘑菇濃湯稍微鹹了點。總體4顆星以上。

兩款義大利麵 中規中矩

"氣氛非常好
燈飾擺設都很棒
很適合拍照打卡

可惜員工會在附近一直抽煙
餐點非常一般 份量也不多

開胃菜：
裡面包辣椒那個（忘記名字了
皮酥 有Q勁
但辣味沒出來
起司味很淡
原本非常期待，但吃起來很沒味

生菜沙拉：
很匪夷所思的加了超多
超級多的巴西利葉（1/4碗）
味道真的⋯很恐怖

義大利麵：
中規中矩，味道不錯
就是料有點少⋯

飲品：
熱紅酒是裡面最喜歡的
果香+肉桂香 很棒

甜點：
大家推薦的布丁
其實⋯有點像底層皮很厚的依蕾特布丁
個人覺得還好

最慘的就是草莓的點心
又貴又難吃 千萬不要點
草莓放超久 發黑又皺
草莓爛沒關係，蛋糕總要好吃吧？
不 口感像是再吃豆沙
不知道是完全沒過篩還是攪拌不均勻
很恐怖的口感
第一次草莓的甜點吃不完
不是吃飽（因為份量真的不大，兩個人點了2千多，吃完還去吃麥當勞），是口感太噁！","氣氛非常好

"個人認爲呼嚕的優點不是在食物而是在整體餐廳的氛圍。
呼嚕在白天與晚上呈現兩種不同風格，白天時是慵懶的呼嚕貓咪感，裝潢文青輕鬆寫意，再搭配附近的山與簡單的飲品還有下午茶，是個很愜意的選擇與氣氛～但晚上搖身一變，立刻變成一個約會的浪漫氛圍（特別是戶外的位子），掛在庭院上的小燈亮起，讓人想起青春約會的美妙氣氛，同時餐廳桌數不多，因此氛圍真的頗美妙！
餐點方面，呼嚕咖啡與下午茶飲品其實不錯，餐點尚可，調酒非常一般～這是讓人稍微失望的小點。
但儘管餐點沒有太大誘惑（本人其實非常重視這點），最後仍有4顆星，就跟前面所提到的，他賣的不是美食，而是政大旁浪漫的氛圍～","個人認爲呼嚕的優點不是在食物而是在整體餐廳的氛圍。

義大利麵是偏硬的麵，點白酒蛤蜊麵調味也很好小小微辣，喜歡清炒類的可以點，另外是蕈菇鹹派也很好吃，推薦！,義大利麵是偏硬的麵，點白酒蛤蜊麵調味也很好小小微辣，喜歡清炒類的可以點，另外是蕈菇鹹派也很好吃，推薦！

"餐廳佈置的滿有氛圍，食物味道還算不賴，焦糖布丁倒的很破碎不過很好吃。

#但是上菜跟服務實在非常需要改進！

同行友人點的一道生菜沙拉從點餐之後一小時才真正上桌⋯
第一次詢問說在煮蛋，
15分鐘後問第二次說蛋是生的煮熟需要時間，
再過一段時間問完第三次後，終於上了沙拉但沒有蛋！
過5分鐘後，那顆傳說中的蛋才終於單獨上桌。
到底是那顆蛋太難煮熟？還是廚師在追求完美之蛋？真正原因不得而知。但如果店員有誠心好好說明相信客人會理解，而不是一直跟客人說一顆水煮蛋要煮個半小時以上⋯

結帳時，跟店員詢問兼抱怨，也只得到一句「因為蛋是生的煮熟需要一段時間，真的不好意思。」

總之，真的是很特別但一次就好的經驗。畢竟，餐點單價也不算低。","餐廳佈置的滿有氛圍，食物味道還算不賴，焦糖布丁倒的很破碎不過很好吃。

3. 建議先訂位，以免想坐的位置沒了！用餐時間90分鐘。
4. 有在做防疫，入店內的人都要量體溫和噴酒精，但還是不夠嚴謹。","餐廳環境很好，店內的裝飾也很用心～本來一心想坐戶外區，但天氣太熱和蚊蟲偏多，果斷放棄。

摩洛哥蘇卡夏整體好吃，醬汁微辣，雞肉不算太嫩但有入味，紅茶可以選無糖就好了。

點心點了檸檬塔，酸度略酸還不錯，口感有點接近慕斯。","店家氣氛還不錯，只收現金。

"兩個人晚餐，由於不太餓，只想找個簡單的輕食來吃，所以來了這裡。紅茶是墨西哥起司雞肉薄餅附的，水果茶另外單點。這樣一共 770 元。

其實那個 brunch 的墨西哥雞肉薄餅由於有薯條，份量還算夠。薯條稍微炸的過了一點點，但是我其實比較喜歡乾一點的，所以沒有問題。雞肉薄餅用的辣椒的辣味不重，但是帶出了辣椒的香味，值得一試。不能吃辣的人應該也不用擔心。

環境還算可以。不過位子不多，內用的話事先訂位可能比較保險。","兩個人晚餐，由於不太餓，只想找個簡單的輕食來吃，所以來了這裡。紅茶是墨西哥起司雞肉薄餅附的，水果茶另外單點。這樣一共 770 元。

"Purrson 呼嚕小酒館距離政大校園步行大概只需要5分鐘，但是不好停車也沒有附設停車位，建議將車子停在鄰近的”萬興國小”，再走路過來，大概10分鐘的時間。如果想搭大眾運輸，可以先搭乘文湖線到動物園站再轉公車到”小坑口”站，基本上下車的地方就是餐廳門口了。這裡距離最近很夯、堪稱台北市最美圖書館的”達賢圖書館“也僅需5分鐘，很適合一起順遊。

老實說，我一直對這樣的網美餐廳有著”虛有其表”的刻板印象。但Purrson 呼嚕小酒館卻顛覆了我的想像。除了塔可卡卡?(有點忘記名字)跟墨魚義大利麵，我們覺得有點鹹外，其他的餐點我們都覺得表現都有來到水準之上，而且有些菜色，我們甚至是第一次看到。Purrson 呼嚕小酒館絕對可以列入政大週邊值得一訪的餐廳。","Purrson 呼嚕小酒館距離政大校園步行大概只需要5分鐘，但是不好停車也沒有附設停車位，建議將車子停在鄰近的”萬興國小”，再走路過來，大概10分鐘的時間。如果想搭大眾運輸，可以先搭乘文湖線到動物園站再轉公車到”小坑口”站，基本上下車的地方就是餐廳門口了。這裡距離最近很夯、堪稱台北市最美圖書館的”達賢圖書館“也僅需5分鐘，很適合一起順遊。

麵份量不少，調味算細緻，蝦子蛤蜊的新鮮度大概80分。品質與價格算相當。整體來說值得一試，但不會想特別再來。,麵份量不少，調味算細緻，蝦子蛤蜊的新鮮度大概80分。品質與價格算相當。整體來說值得一試，但不會想特別再來。

"實在是很不推薦的店，環境不舒適、餐點份量也少的傻眼。
最近木柵常下大雨、氣溫高、濕度高，但店家怎樣就是不開冷氣，只給了電風扇吹，店內潮濕悶熱不舒服，只因為全店只有2位客人就不開，很不舒服的環境⋯點了冰咖啡，店員送上來時我和友人立即傻眼，冰咖啡竟然比水杯還小杯，我三口就喝完了，很不推薦！另外也點了布丁，布丁很好吃，但是也是超小，放在高腳布丁杯內，杯子都比布丁大上許多，以這樣的份量，價格是不便宜的，此店吃裝潢的，想拍照可以去，不過其實此店並沒有網路上拍照起來這麼大間，可以不用抱太大期望。","It is really a very not recommended store. The environment is uncomfortable and the meals are dumbfounded.
Recently, Muzha often under heavy rain, high temperature, and high humidity, but the store does not turn on air -conditioning, only blowing the electric fan, the store in the store is damp and uncomfortable, just because there are only 2 guests in the store, it will not open. I ordered Ice Coffee. When the clerk was sent, my friends and I were dumbfounded. Ice coffee was even smaller than the water cup. I finished drinking three, and it was not recommended!In addition, I ordered the pudding. The pudding is delicious, but it is also super small. It is placed in the high pudding cup. The cups are much larger than the pudding. In this portion, the price is not cheap. You can go to take pictures, but in fact, this store does not have such a big picture on the Internet, you don't need to hold too much expectations."

氣氛很棒的小酒館！不只能拍美美的照片，重點餐點也是很美味！我們在中午最後用餐時間前5分鐘抵達，但詢問服務人員後，還是有讓我們用正餐！！座位是在樓上，但因為可以用QR code點餐就不用跑上跑下的，覺得這點還算蠻方便的！,"The atmosphere is great, a small tavern!Not only can I take beautiful photos, the key meals are also delicious!We arrived 5 minutes before the meal at the end of the noon, but after asking the service staff, there was still a meal for us!IntersectionThe seat is upstairs, but because you can order with QR Code, you don't need to run up and down. It is quite convenient to think this!"

義大利麵應該是煮太久了，吃的時候都變成斷掉的短短麵條。味道還可以，份量偏少,"The pasta should be cooked for too long, and when eating, it becomes a short noodle.The taste is okay, the portion is too small"
"干貝燉飯---雖然菜單上寫說是義式傳統保留米心的，但實際上吃起來還是像台式燉飯，米心也不明顯。另外送上來的時候就已經快涼掉了，更不用說干貝完全是涼的......

牛排義大利麵---個人喜歡麵體的Q度，牛排的口感也不錯，但是跟燉飯的狀況一樣，送上來的時候就已經快涼掉了，一上來馬上吃了一塊牛排第一口就已經是涼的...

雞肉薄餅---餅皮很薄、很酥脆，餡料夾很多，讓薄餅變得很不薄，味道好吃。可惜內餡有一點點辣，如果能貼心註記一下更好 --- 這也是唯一一道吃起來是熱的餐點。

磅蛋糕---味道不錯，口感也很好。但是可能當天溫度太低，導致吃起來有點過涼，如果是一般天氣吃常溫的應該OK，私心建議這麼冷的天氣可以稍微加熱過應該會更好

布丁---榮登本次用餐最愛餐點，和partner一致認為真的好吃，很推！

環境很舒服、廁所很乾淨、服務人員也很親切和服務，但和partner都覺得餐點如果可以再用心點就更好了！

更失望的是跟櫃檯反應後，店家卻沒有抱歉的感覺，只是敷衍的態度回應，客戶體驗很差⋯不會再來。","特地開車到此網紅店，期待食物也會好吃，點了一大桌，結果相當失望。

我吃半盤配了兩杯水
但是牛肉好吃
還點了墨魚燉飯（300元） 墨魚中間有點沒熟的感覺
但是還可以 有炭香味
店面太小 整間店讓人感覺擁擠
8.有唱歌表演 但是在原本就很小的店面再塞一個樂隊
覺得不夠有情調
服務人員不會笑 但也沒有不禮貌
用餐時間到之前會提醒你兩次
可能是深怕下組客人來不及

結語：不會再來","""This shop has a Shouxing Rating Five Star Evaluation French French fries""
Steak Italian Noodles (380 yuan) My face is super oil and super dry
I ate half a plate with two glasses of water
But beef is delicious
Also ordered the cuttlefish stew rice (300 yuan) in the middle of the cuttlefish.
But there can be charcoal fragrance
The store is too small, the whole store makes people feel crowded
8. There are singing performances, but a band in a small store in the original small store
Feeling is not affectionate enough
The service staff will not laugh, but there is no impoliteness
I will remind you twice before the meal time
Maybe I am afraid that the guests will be too late

"義大利麵麵條是偏硬的，口感很好，墨西哥餅中規中矩，餐點都算好吃，但紅茶不推。

算是每次路過都說下次要來說很久的店，初訪但實話蠻失望。餐點都ok店內擺設也漂亮，但為什麼要放中國抖音歌歌單⋯整個氣氛大扣分，隨便一個網路免費輕音樂都會加分吧，又不是隔壁熱炒店@@可惜了這個空間（攤手）","Italian noodles are hard and taste good. Mexican cakes are quite satisfactory. The meals are delicious, but black tea does not push.

Every time I passed by, I said that the next time for a long time, I visited the first visit but the truth was quite disappointed.The meals are also beautiful in the store, but why do you put the Chinese Douyin song and song list?

點了牛排並要求五分熟。他們做得很好。把它寄回去，他們給了我一個中等程度的切口，但脂肪含量為 25%。可怕。,"Click the steak and ask for five points.They do well.Send it back, they gave me a medium -sized incision, but the fat content was 25%.horrible."
這家餐廳有一種非常溫馨和鄉村的氛圍。氣氛也非常質樸懷舊，食物也非常好而且非常豐盛。他們提供從咖啡到雞尾酒的飲料以及米飯、義大利麵、牛排和甜點等食物。他們的實體菜單沒有英文，但數字菜單有。他們似乎只接受現金作為付款方式。,"This restaurant has a very warm and rural atmosphere.The atmosphere is also very simple and old, and the food is very good and very rich.They provide food from coffee to cocktails and foods such as rice, pasta, steaks and desserts.Their physical menu is not English, but the digital menu is available.They seem to only accept cash as a payment method."
"這看起來就像是家庭住宅與餐廳的對話。  環境不錯，但是很熱。有空調，但門是開著的......
我吃了一份油炸玉米粉餅，簡單又美味！  莎莎醬就夠一份了。  排骨是乾的。他們不提供台灣啤酒，這對大多數台灣人來說沒關係。   總體而言，對於所提供的品質來說有點過於昂貴。","This looks like a dialogue between family houses and restaurants.The environment is good, but it is very hot.There are air conditioners, but the door is open ...
I ate a fried corn powder, simple and delicious!Sasha sauce is enough.Pork ribs are dry.They do not provide Taiwanese beer, which has nothing to do with most Taiwanese.Overall, it is a bit too expensive for the quality provided."

上層空間很小，地下室大部分空間都有戶外花園。食物很美味，但上菜速度有點慢。成本有點高。週末晚上有樂團表演。 NCCU 週邊浪漫美食的好選擇。,"The upper space is very small, and most of the space in the basement has outdoor gardens.The food is delicious, but the food is a bit slow.The cost is a bit high.There is an orchestra performance on the weekend.Good choice for romantic food around NCCU."
非常好吃😋,Very delicious 😋

"這是路邊的小店，走過去就好了。但一旦你嚐過他們的飯菜，你就會想一次又一次地回來。

他們提供歐洲風味的菜餚。德國豬肘、義大利麵和英式炸魚！不過菜單上沒有看到謝潑德的派。

許多菜餚都與他們出售的啤酒和葡萄酒相得益彰。請向女服務生諮詢建議。

地方比較小，建議預約。天氣暖和的時候坐室內的座位，這裡的蚊子可不溫柔","This is a small shop on the roadside, just walk over.But once you tasted their meals, you would want to come back again and again.

They offer European -style dishes.German pork elbow, pasta and British fried fish!But the menu was not seen on the menu.

Many dishes complement the beer and wine they sold.Please consult the female waiter.

The place is relatively small, and it is recommended to make an appointment.Sit a seat indoors when the weather is warm, but the mosquitoes here are not gentle"

可愛的餐廳。菜單和點餐均透過二維碼進行。他們有義大利菜。有點貴。茶很好。培根蛋麵、松露薯條和大蒜麵包都不錯。,"Cute restaurant.The menu and ordering are performed through the QR code.They have Italian cuisine.It's a bit expensive.Tea is very good.Bacon egg noodles, truffle potato strips and garlic bread are good."
在動物園度過了漫長的一天後，來到了這個不錯的小度假勝地。涼爽的氛圍和優質的服務。,"After a long day in the zoo, I came to this good small resort.The cool atmosphere and high -quality service."

非常好的用餐和用餐環境,Very good dining and dining environment
食物一般而且不便宜。氣氛極不受歡迎。  透過二維碼從菜單上訂購食物，因此客人和主人之間無法進行溝通。,"Food is average and not cheap.The atmosphere is extremely unpopular.Order food from the menu through the QR code, so the guest and the owner cannot communicate."
好地方，有很棒的氛圍。喜歡義大利麵和布丁。,"A good place, there is a great atmosphere.Like Italian noodles and pudding."

環境和食物都不錯，但是如果工作人員穿著乾淨的圍裙的話肯定會更好看。,"The environment and food are good, but if the staff is wearing a clean apron, it will definitely look better."
