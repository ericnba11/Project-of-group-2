"進去就有個煙味🤪
先被帶到廁所旁的位置
服務人員很好 有空位 主動幫我們更換位置
服務很好 問問題都很有耐心解答
生意很好捏 到了九點 還是有客人進來用餐
生蠔 很大顆 但有一點腥味 之前在美川吃的更新鮮
鮭魚不錯吃 滿大片的
整體食物偏鹹
烤天使紅蝦 和烤魚 都好鹹 蝦烤完只剩一點點🤣
烤魚 是我們第一次沒吃完的
之前在無盡藏吃的cp 值更高ㄧ點
其他的烤串也都不錯吃 但有點膩
生啤酒有點小杯🤣
今天就嚐鮮 應該有很久才會再來🤪","There is a smell of smoke in entering 个
Before being taken to the position of the toilet
The service staff is very good and has a vacant position to actively help us replace the position
The service is very good to ask questions, and they are patient with patient answers
The business is very good to squeeze at nine o'clock or guests come in for dinner
The oysters are very large but a little fishy smell is fresher before I eat in Michigawa
Salmon is good to eat large blockbusters
The overall food is salty
Both the roast angel red shrimp and grilled fish are all salty shrimp, only a little bit of roasting 🤣
The grilled fish was the first time we haven't finished eating
The CP value that had been eaten in the endless hidden before was higher.
Other skewers are also good but a little greasy
Summary beer is a little cup 有
It should be a long time to take a long time today. I will come again."
餐點味道都很剛好，尤其炙燒鮭魚蝦壽司非常讚，必點！一開始跟店員說要燒啤，結果第一位店員推薦用生啤來做，送上來的時候第二位店員說生啤建議直接喝，我們表示這是前一位店員建議之後，第二位店員也很爽快的說第一位還不熟，直接幫我們換成罐裝啤酒，處理方式很好👍🏻店內唯一的小小小缺點是音樂有點太大聲，但完全不影響會想再來的機會！推推,"The taste of the meal is just right, especially the burning salmon shrimp sushi is very good, must be ordered!At the beginning, I told the clerk to burn beer. As a result, the first clerk recommended it to make raw beer. When it was sent, the second clerk said that the birth beer was advised to drink it directly. The clerk is also very refreshing to say that the first place is not familiar, and it directly helps us to replace it with canned beer. The only small disadvantage in the shop is a little loud that the music is too loud, but it does not affect the will want to come again. Chance!Push"
"生日有生魚片🎂
蛋捲很厚 紫蘇梅番茄很開胃！
推推！","There are sashimi in the birthday 生
Egg rolls are very thick, perilla plums are appetizing!
Push!"
櫛瓜不知道為啥吃起來都是苦的，其他餐點口味都還不錯，鮮魚湯和蛤蜊湯很清甜。,I do n’t know why it tastes bitter. The taste of other meals is not bad. Fresh fish soup and clam soup are very sweet.
"餐點好吃 服務很好
很喜歡的一家店
家庭或朋友聚餐都很適合！
羊筋串大推👍

隔壁桌客人 帶鳥來有點吵一直發出噪音
店家也有去勸導 但還是沒什麼效果
帶寵物來餐廳用餐 就不要影響他人
辛苦店員了～🙏","The meal is delicious and the service is very good
I like a shop very much
Family or friends are suitable for dinner!
Big push of sheep bands 大 大

The guests next door are a bit noisy to bring birds to make noise
The store also has to persuade but it still has no effect
Do not affect others with pets to eat in the restaurant
Hard the clerk ~ 员 员"
"好吃，當月壽星有招待生魚片蛋糕
👍","It's delicious, the Shouxing has a pawn of sashimi cakes in the month
Bleak"
鮭魚🍣味增火鍋 料好實在鮮度超讚👍 意猶未盡 配上梅酒 日式感🈵🈵！ 五星推薦👈,Salmon 味 好 ingredients are really fresh and superb.Five -star recommendation 👈
上菜速度快，用餐環境良好。會讓人再次用餐,The food is fast and the dining environment is good.Will make people dine again
第一次來嚐鮮，只能說沒有很驚豔，普通的居酒屋，但喝酒聚會的好去處,"For the first time, you can only say that there is no amazing, ordinary izakaya, but a good place for drinking party"
"公司聚餐有提前預訂，接洽的是位謝小姐，人很親切，幫我們配好對應希望的價位
有需要自帶酒，點店家同款酒類，可以免開瓶費，店內氣氛蠻好的本來想要預訂包廂，但是地下室擔心收訊不好，所以選1樓的座位，座位有點小擠，坐裡面的人要進出就沒那麼方便！
10位用餐預算控制預算在一萬，不含酒水跟服務費，一萬元可以搞定，要外加一成的服務費跟酒的金額
餐點蠻多元的也配得很好，蠻好吃的，生魚片很新鮮，鮭魚有點少😅
串燒考得恰到好處，都蠻好吃的
員工聚餐或三五好友小酌，蠻推薦的店家！","The company's dinner is booked in advance.
If you need to bring your own wine, order the same wine in the shop, you can avoid the bottle opening fee. The atmosphere in the store originally wants to book the box, but the basement is worried that the receipt is not good, so choose the seat on the first floor. It is not so convenient to enter and exit!
The budget control budget for 10 digits is 10,000, without wine and service fees, 10,000 yuan can be done.
The meal is quite diverse and it is very good. It is delicious. The sashimi of the sashimi is very fresh, and the salmon is a bit less.
The skewers are just right, it's pretty delicious
Employee dinner or three or five friends to drink, it is quite recommended!"
"我們一行人9位總共消費了一萬六千多，酒錢約六千多，沒有坐樓下的包廂
（包廂低消一萬，但是我們覺得比較不通風鼻子有點過敏之外，也比較沒有熱鬧的氣氛）
吃的喝的幾乎都很ok，一上桌就迅速被大家嗑光。
不過其中幾點特別提出來：
-明太子雞肉串吃多有點膩，應該是醬的問題
-天使蝦不太新鮮，會有過敏反應的朋友吃了嘴唇就有腫起來
-羊肉串的騷味令其中一位敢吃羊的朋友覺得味道太重，他第一次感到騷味的害怕
-魚下巴烤的不錯
-沙拉挺大盆
-抹茶梅酒是大家公認當天喝過最好喝的
-沙瓦是公認最不好喝的
-結帳以後回家看明細發現多算了一瓶酒錢，與店家反應後有馬上退款給我們了👍🏽

店家服務態度也很優，感覺隨時可以跟我們來一杯🤣","Our group of 9 people spent more than 16,000, about 6,000 wines, and did not sit downstairs in the box downstairs
(The box is 10,000, but we feel that it is less ventilated and a bit allergic, and there is no lively atmosphere)
Almost all the foods and drinks are very OK.
But some of them are specifically raised:
-The Ming prince chicken skewers is a bit greasy, it should be a problem of sauce
-The angel shrimp is not very fresh, friends with allergic reactions have swollen lips when they eat their lips
-The taste of lamb skewers makes one of the friends who dare to eat sheep feel the taste is too heavy.
-The fish chin is baked well
-Salat
-Mathame
-Shawa is recognized as the most not delicious
-After checkout, I went home to see the details and found that a bottle of wine was calculated. After responding to the store, I immediately refunded it.

The service attitude of the store is also very good, I feel that I can come with us at any time."
"第一次來用餐，環境還不錯
服務還不錯，餐點好吃😋","Come to dinner for the first time, the environment is not bad
The service is not bad, the meal is delicious 服务"
"座位蠻寬敞舒適的

餐點口味上都還不錯

個人覺得炸牛蒡再甜一點會更好🤔🤭🤭","Seats are spacious and comfortable

The meal tastes good

Personally, I think the fried burdock will be better again 🤔🤭🤭"
店員服務的態度很好，上菜的速度都蠻快的，店內的氛圍歡樂，很適合各式各類的聚餐地點👍👍👍,"The attitude of the clerk's service is very good, and the speed of serving is quite fast. The atmosphere in the store is very happy, which is very suitable for all kinds of dinner locations."
"跟女性朋友聚餐第一次來踩點，餐點真的不錯，推薦胡麻冷麵跟炒水蓮，許多人推薦的鮭魚蝦壽司也很棒。
店員姐姐很親切友善，還會開玩笑，很可愛
缺點是靠店門太近的座位，只要門打開就會有煙味飄進來有點掃興，不知道能不能把吸煙區往旁邊挪...
整體來說是很不錯又好吃的店，下次會再光顧！","For the first time to step on a meal with female friends, the meal is really good. Recommended flax cold noodles and stir -fried lotus lotus. Many people recommended salmon shrimp sushi are also great.
The clerk sister is very kind and friend
The disadvantage is that it is too close to the store. As long as the door opens, there will be a smell of smoke.
Overall, it is a very good and delicious shop, and I will visit again next time!"
山藥細麵好吃～生日送生魚片蛋糕！,The thin noodles of yam ~ Birthday to give sashimi cake!
"有氣氛的居酒屋料理
炒飯跟炒水蓮味道都很棒
還有生日當月的生魚片蛋糕👍 …","Izakaya dishes with atmosphere
Fried rice and fried water lotus taste great
There is also a sashimi cake on the birthday of the month ..."
今天第一次來用餐，用餐環境不錯，離家蠻近的。餐點也好吃，下次會再來,"I came to dine for the first time today. The dining environment is good, and it is quite close to home.The meals are delicious, and I will come again next time"
"餐點美味： 85分
用餐環境： 85分
服務態度： 90分
價錢：中上

心得：在東湖國小的對面，這邊停車很不方便建議可以停到國小樓下的停車場位子還算蠻多的，首先來說用餐環境我個人覺得用餐環境偏小而其實有些桌子設計的有點奇怪，只要裡面有人坐的話要出來的話全部的人都必須要起身讓開，非常的不方便，餐點的部分我個人認為都還算蠻好吃的，我個人是尤其喜歡他的烤節瓜真的非常好吃，但是價格的部分我個人認為偏貴了一些些，今天三個人吃總共花了2600多塊只提供白開水。每道菜份量都很少不是讓人吃飽足的餐廳，廁所乾淨，服務態度還算可以，","Meal delicious: 85 points
Meal environment: 85 points

Experience: Opposite to the East Lake Elementary School, it is inconvenient to park here. It is recommended to park the parking lot under the elementary school. It's a bit strange. As long as someone is sitting in it, all people must get up and let it go. It is very inconvenient. I personally think that the meal part is quite delicious. I personally like his roasting. Jiangua is really delicious, but the price part I personally think it is more expensive. Today, the three people spent more than 2,600 pieces of boiled water.The amount of each dish is rarely a restaurant that makes people eat full. The toilet is clean and the service attitude is okay."
"餐點滿分😭店員服務態度也很好！當天因為胃不太舒服沒有吃太多，但店員馬上倒上熱茶，非常貼心（也有隨時來加滿），熱湯也不錯，應該是東湖地區最優秀的居酒屋🏮

非常推薦🉐️特上生魚片❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥山藥海膽細麵、海大蝦天婦羅、喜知次一夜干、串燒類也好吃（烤雞腿肉蔥串👍🏻）😋","The service attitude of the meal is full!On the same day, because the stomach was not comfortable and did not eat too much, the clerk immediately poured hot tea, very intimate (also over -full at any time), hot soup is also good, it should be the best izakaya area in the East Lake area 🏮

Recommended 生️ Special sashimi ❤️ ❤️‍🔥 Yam Yam, sea urchin fine noodles, sea shrimp tempura, happy and well -known all night, skewers are also delicious (grilled chicken leg, green onion skewers) 😋"

3.生蠔很腥
4.牛舌也不優
5.烤天使紅蝦蝦頭裡面很黑，根本不能吃，比釣蝦場品質還差？
照單點店來說，整體偏下
上次去東區吃到飽居酒屋還比這邊好吃
這間吃完直接回家拉肚子，有夠痛","The meal is fast, plum wine is delicious, but very small cups

1. The soup next to the wine steamed oyster is not hot
2. Oyster is not fresh enough

4. The beef tongue is not good
5. Baked angel red shrimp head is very dark in the head. Can't eat at all. It is worse than the quality of the shrimp.

我們因為帶狗狗走很久，有點晚還沒吃飯，謝謝你們讓我們坐很舒服的位子，還有很棒的好服務、親切貼心的接待、和超友善的夥伴們，重點是食物超好吃的！我最喜歡醬烤大腸還有炒烏龍麵！鹽烤牛肋條與雞腿肉也是必點：）,"Because we have taken the dog for a long time, we have n’t eaten a little late. Thank you for letting us sit very comfortable, and have great good services, intimate and intimate reception, and super -friendly partners.

"CP值很高的居酒屋🏮

兩位當月壽星都送上生魚片蛋糕與祝福🥰","Izakaya with a high CP value 🏮

服務周到，食材新鮮，製作精美好吃。,"Small service, fresh ingredients, exquisite and delicious production."

鮭魚握壽司好吃，壽星招待生魚片生日蛋糕很棒,"Salmon grip sushi is delicious, and Shouxing entertains sashimi sashimi birthday cake is great"
第一次進店用餐，餐點都很棒欸，服務人員也都好親切😍,"The first time I entered the store for dining, the meals were great, and the service staff were also very kind."
"豪好吃 想念日本了！
當月壽星打卡有送生魚片蛋糕or烤麻糬","Missing Japan is so delicious!
In the month, Shouxing punch card with sashimi cake or grilled hemp"
今天帶媽媽來家後面居酒屋用餐 點的菜就是一個讚，清酒搭配生魚片，烤肉(就不細說），愛吃日本料理就當場來點餐吧！,"Today, I took my mother to live in the izakaya to eat meals. The sake with sake with sashimi, barbecue (just do n’t talk about it), let ’s order for Japanese food!"
"1️⃣炙燒鮭魚明太子炸蝦捲，一口滿滿的東西好好吃，明太子配上炙燒鮭魚，油香油香的，配上鹹鹹的鮭魚卵，剛剛好。

2️⃣串燒類調味跟烤的熟度都蠻不錯的，蝦子很新鮮。

3️⃣明太子起司蛋捲，很罪惡又很奢侈的東西，蛋本身感覺沒有什麼調味，搭配超級牽絲的起司，鹹香的明太子覺得很不錯。

✨二訪：炸牛蒡很下酒，天婦羅微空虛可以不用點，肥腸普通，烤青甘下巴很好吃

價格吃下來兩人1400左右含服務費，有免費熱茶可以喝很棒，不用硬要點貴貴的飲料。東湖也有好吃的居酒屋日料啦","1️⃣ The roasted salmon, the prince of the prince, fried shrimp rolls, and the whole thing is delicious.

2️⃣ The skewers are pretty good, and the shrimp is very fresh.

3️⃣ Prince Ming's cheese egg roll, very sinful and luxurious thing. The egg itself feels no seasoning. With the super -silk cheese, the salty Prince Ming Monumi feels very good.

蒡 Second visit: fried beef gangsters are very wine, the tempura is empty, there is no need to order, the fat intestines are ordinary, and the roasted green and sweet chin is delicious

The price is eaten by about 1400 service fees. There are free hot tea to drink very well.East Lake also has delicious izakaya Japanese food"
"平日晚上外場只有兩位店員，看起來似乎有點忙碌，但是年輕的兩位店員態度都很好很親切。
整體感覺偏台式，尤其是炒烏龍面，烤物串燒醬烤香菇、鹽烤雞腿肉蔥串味道不錯、肉也嫩，七里香吃起來稍微有些雞屁股的臭味，可以再處理好一些；炙燒比目魚緣側肉握壽司還可以再加強，比較近乎全油脂卻又燒的程度不夠沒有逼出油脂的香氣，可惜。","There are only two clerks outside the scene on weekdays, and they seem to be a bit busy, but the two young clerks are very good and kind.
Overall feels partially desktop, especially fried oolong noodles, roasted skewers, roasted shiitake mushrooms, salted grilled chicken legs, and the meat is good and tender. The burning of the sideways of the fish edge of the fish can also be strengthened. The degree of oil is almost full of fat but not enough to force the aroma of fat, but unfortunately."
東西每樣很好吃、還是寵物友善店家👍,"Everything is delicious, or a pet friendly shop 👍"
餐點好吃氣氛佳！,The delicious atmosphere is good!
餐點味道都很好吃😋～ …,The taste of the meal is delicious ~ ...
"餐點精緻好吃，服務讚！
生魚片蛋糕真的太棒了！","The meal is delicate and delicious, and the service is like!
The sashimi cake is really great!"
玉子燒口感軟糯（明太子味不顯），炒烏龍麵條Q彈醬汁美味，串燒口感細嫩調味合宜，生魚片新鮮份量充足 （自製醬油甘甜），味噌湯調味稍淡，鮭魚親子炒飯鮭魚香氣十足、卵再添鹹鮮味水蓮平平，豬排較乾。但整體還蠻合胃口的,"Yuzi burning mouth is soft and waxy (the prince is not flavor), fried oolong noodles Q bomb sauce are delicious, skewers are delicate and delicious, and the sashimi sashimi is sufficient (the homemade soy sauce is sweet) The fried rice salmon is full of aroma, and the eggs are flat and the salty water lotus is flat, and the pork chop is dry.But the overall appetite is quite good"
"千里迢迢土城，大同來到“東湖”巷仔內的“鳥居町”居酒屋～
真的是捷運轉捷運轉公車果然…………有那價值，不然我一定會噴血！

"好吃 點的東西都沒有雷
東西多樣 服務好 但份量偏少微貴","There is no thunder
There are diverse services, but the portion is small and small."
"蘆筍手捲、炙燒干貝握壽司、鮭魚飯糰、鹽烤節瓜、酒蒸蛤蜊、醬燒雞腿肉蔥卷串、炸牛蒡仙貝、鹽烤中卷，總共$1500出頭

吃下來沒有踩雷的品項，食材處理不錯，蛤蜊沒有沙、菜類不會太老等等，但整體比較中規中矩，沒有太讓人驚艷的地方，不過平時如果想吃平價居酒屋的話這間值得回訪

另外有兩點想稱讚店家，其一是炸牛蒡上桌時店員不小心撒了，很及時清理並補了一些給我們（份量還挺多），服務態度很好，店家很大氣

再來是我們有外帶鮭魚炒飯&剩下的炸牛蒡（真的很多），放了差不多一個小時食物都還是溫的脆的，應該是有挑過外帶容器，這裡有外送，下次也可以試試","Asparagus hand rolls, roasted scallops holding sushi, salmon rice ball, salt grilled melon, wine steamed clam, roasted chicken legs, fried beef ravioli skewers, salt roasted medium rolls, a total of $ 1500

I do n’t have the items to step on the mine. The ingredients are handled well. The clams do not have sand, the dishes will not be too old, etc., but the overall is quite satisfactory, there is no amazing place, but if you want to eat a cheap 酒 酒, this is worth this. Return visit

There are two other points to praise the store. One is that the clerk accidentally sprinkled when the fried beef was on the table, cleaned up and made up some for us (there were quite a lot of weight), the service attitude was very good, the store was very atmospheric

Then, we have salmon fried rice & the remaining fried beef grucs (really many). After almost an hour of food, the food is still warm and crispy. There should be a take -off container. Can try"
"炙燒比目魚鰭邊肉壽司非常好吃，
入口即化！！！而且魚片很大，吃起來超滿足！家母瘋狂愛上！

牆面上還有比較限量的餐點，今天點了紅甘魚頭，滿滿的膠原蛋白，臉頰肉又嫩又油，吃起來非常爽快。

紫蘇梅醋番茄超級解膩，份量也超級大，我還以為吃不完，但看我媽一口接著一口瞬間吃光光（他很愛吃醋）

炙燒比目魚星鰻丼飯CP值超級高，兩尾星鰻跟大片的比目魚，這樣居然只要320$，太傻眼了趕快加入口袋名單。

最後有提醒店家某浪浪樂捐箱是詐騙集團，那個老闆利用人的愛心，把錢都拿去買土地了，希望店家能稍微注意一點這部分。

太好吃了，沒想到東湖能有這麼平價新鮮的居酒屋餐廳，真是太感動了！","It is very delicious than the meat sushi of the fishey finishine.
The entrance is melted!IntersectionIntersectionAnd the fish fillet is very large, it is super satisfied!Mother's fell in love with crazy!

There is also a relatively limited meal on the wall. Today, I ordered the red glycry fish head, full of collagen, the cheeks are tender and oily, and it tastes very refreshing.

Perilla plum vinegar tomatoes are super greasy, and the portion is super large. I thought I couldn't finish eating, but I saw my mother and ate light in an instant (he loved jealousy)

The CP value of the burning fish star eel rice is super high, and the two -tailed star eels and large -scale fishes. This is only 320 $.

In the end, a reminder of the store's Langlangle donation box was a fraud group. The boss used people's love to take the money to buy land. I hope that the store can pay attention to this part.

It's so delicious. I didn't expect Donghu to have such a cheap and fresh izakaya restaurant. It was really moved!"
"生魚片很新鮮
酒蒸蛤蜊很好吃😋","Girl sashimi is very fresh
Steaming clam is delicious 蜊"
"疫情趨緩可以比較放心去吃美食, 來到東湖這間居酒屋用餐, 裡面有濃厚的日本風, 每個座位都有隔板區隔, 座位也很舒適.
我今天點了好幾道菜都很好吃! 像是鮭魚毛毛蟲壽司/明太子起司蛋捲/豪華海鮮丼飯/日式手作煎餃和超大份的牛小排, 一家四口吃得美味又飽足! 很推薦給喜歡日料的朋友","Slowing the epidemic can rest assured to eat food. When you come to the izakaya in Donghu, there is a strong Japanese style. Each seat has a partition separation, and the seat is also very comfortable.
I ordered several dishes today for a few dishes! For example, salmon caterpillar sushi/Prince Prince cheese egg rolls/luxury seafood rice rice/Japanese -style hand -made fried dumplings and large beef steaks, a family of four ate delicious and delicious Full! I recommend it to friends who like Japanese materials"
本次主要是點串燒跟握壽司，搭啤酒小酌。就串燒跟握壽司來說水準很不錯，物有所值。服務生很主動積極但不會太干擾。環境很有日式風且每個位置都有跟隔壁遮蔽，感覺很好,"This time, it is mainly a skewers and holding sushi, and beer with beer.In terms of skewers and holdings, the standard is very good, and it is worthwhile.The waiter is active but not too interference.The environment is very Japanese -style and there are covered by the next door. It feels very good"
餐點中規中矩，店內空氣有點悶熱，晚餐時段上菜速度會比較久，建議點一些非烤類的小點心當開胃菜，烤鮭魚還可以 ，滿大一大一尾，另一種魚比較有腥味。價格算中上價。,"The meal is quite satisfactory, the air in the store is a bit sultry, and the food speed will be longer during dinner. It is recommended to order some non -grilled small snacks as appetizers. The grilled salmon is okay. EssenceThe price is calculated."
"店家服務態度好，但食物偏雷
2/28晚間消費1180元，含一成服務費
點了龍蝦沙拉手卷、炙燒明太子玉子燒、炒水蓮、唐揚雞、烤魚、海膽壽司、鮭魚炒飯。

• 最誇張的海膽壽司240元非常不值得，此生見過最迷你的壽司小到根本快是一般大小的1/2

• 鮭魚炒飯炒過頭了有點可惜，魚肉變得很韌要嚼很久，整體偏乾不好吞嚥，要配茶吃比較好

• 龍蝦沙拉手卷的海苔放太久已經軟掉

• 炙燒明太子玉子燒上面美乃滋太厚了吃不太到明太子味道，調味也不太行，整體偏酸

• 唐揚雞剛起鍋肉很嫩，但沒有瀝油加上皮偏厚，吃到最後太油了

• 炒水蓮和烤魚是今天晚上覺得好吃的料理

覺得整體價位對不起餐點品質，且份量也吃不飽，晚上7:30生魚片就賣光了有點可惜。五星評價送可樂，但希望店家可以更注重料理品質。","The store has a good service attitude, but the food lapels
In the evening of 2/28, the consumption of 1180 yuan, including 10 % service fee
Ordered lobster salad hand rolls, burning prince Yizi Yaki, fried lotus lotus, Tang Yang chicken, grilled fish, sea urchin sushi, salmon fried rice.

• The most exaggerated sea urchin sushi 240 yuan is not worth it. I have seen the most mini sushi in this life.

• It is a pity that the salmon fried rice is too fried. It is a pity that the fish becomes very tough and chews for a long time.

• Lobster salad hand rolls are softened for too long

• Burning Prince Ming Prince Yuzi Burning on the top is too thick. It is not too good to eat, and the seasoning is not very good. The overall is sour

• Tang Yang chicken is very tender in the pot, but there is no oil and thick skin, and it is too oily when it is eaten.

• Stir -fried lotus lotus and grilled fish are delicious dishes tonight

I feel that the overall price is sorry for the quality of the meal, and the weight is not enough. It is a pity that the sashimi sashimi is sold at 7:30 pm.The five -star evaluation is delivered to Coca -Cola, but I hope that the store can pay more attention to cooking quality."
"（2023更新）菜單升級（價格也升級）但是以居酒屋來說有更多好料可以吃
有酒單跟丼飯跟好的壽司選項

👍允許帶寵物（可以落地）但要不影響其他客人為主，身為東湖少見的寵物友善餐廳必須給5顆星

東湖很不錯的居酒屋，終於有一間是開到半夜的餐廳而不是小吃！孜然烤羊肉/松阪豬肉串很好吃，但蔥鹽牛五花很雷因爲肉很粗硬，希望有機會改善。薑絲湯類都不錯，湯底乾淨無沙子，很喜歡喝，幾乎每次必點。鮭魚丼料豐富cp值很高。炒青菜也很推，水蓮和波菜是附近比較少見的炒青菜，也推。
2021疫情之後菜單有改變，很推鹽烤松阪豬肉串、比目魚跟炙燒鮭魚壽司～炒烏龍也好吃","(2023 update) The menu is upgraded (the price is also upgraded) But there is more good ingredients for izakaya to eat
There are wine lists and good rice and good sushi options

（Allow pets (can be landed) but it does not affect other guests. As a rare pet friendly restaurant in the East Lake, 5 stars must be given

East Lake's very good izakaya, finally there is a restaurant to open to the middle of the night instead of snacks!Cumin grilled mutton/Matsusaka pork skewers are delicious, but the onion and salt beef flowers are very thunderous because the meat is very thick, hoping to have the opportunity to improve.Ginger soup is good. The soup base is clean and there is no sand. I like to drink very much.The rich CP value of salmon is high.Stir -fried vegetables are also pushed. Water lotus and waves are rare fried vegetables nearby, and they are also pushed.
After 2021, the menu has changed. Push salt grilled Matsusaka pork skewers, Bigan fish and roasted salmon sushi ~ fried oolong is also delicious"
"平價美食，老闆超級熱情介紹，位子不會很擠，食物種類多。
我們點了鮭魚炒飯、野菜炒烏龍、豆皮壽司、蘆筍手捲、薑絲蛤蠣湯、鮮魚味噌湯、(九州)一夜干、好長雞肉串、豬五花串、杏胞菇串。
烏龍麵跟炒飯還有湯一上桌熱熱享用很好吃，本來看到平價說不優還緊張了一下，幸好都還不錯，雞肉串也是很嫩但沒有很可怕，名子取得很好笑。一夜干也是烤得很不錯!沒有生生的感覺。覺得還好的是豬五花肉串跟杏胞菇串，有點鹹了...其他都還不錯，服務生會常常留意我們，幫我們加茶，上菜速度也算快。餐廳越晚人越多，畢竟開到晚上12:00⋯⋯","For cheap food, the boss is super enthusiastic, the seat will not be crowded, and there are many types of food.
We ordered salmon fried rice, wild vegetable fried oolong, bean skin sushi, asparagus hand rolls, ginger clam oyster soup, fresh fish miso soup, (Kyushu) overnight, good chicken skewers, pork pentaques, and solid cytoslocon skewers.
Oolong noodles, fried rice, and soup are delicious and enjoyable at the table. I originally saw that the price is not good and tense. Fortunately, the chicken skewers are very tender but not terrible. The name is funny. EssenceIt is also very good to roast overnight! There is no feeling of life.Fortunately, the pork pork belly skewers and the almond mushroom skewers are a bit salty ... The others are not bad. The waiters often pay attention to us and help us add tea.The later the restaurant, the more people, after all, until 12:00 in the evening ..."
"餐廳旁邊有停車場，室內格局還算不錯，桌與桌之間都有間隔開來，雖然座位空間不大，但至少聊天的聲音不會與隔壁互相干擾。
但是餐點的部份就很一般，這次餐點如下：
日式鮭魚炒飯：就是一般的鮭魚炒飯，但是鮭魚肉末又小也少的可憐，但是口味吃起來是ok的。
牛蕃茄佐紫蘇冰梅醬：正常水平。
薑絲蛤蜊湯：蛤蜊大約6～7顆吧！湯頭喝起來並沒有特別鮮甜，但至少還沒有腥味。
炙燒比目魚鰭邊肉握壽司：這是這次用餐唯一可以的餐點，握壽司旁有附紅薑，另外有多附芥末，但是芥末沒什麼嗆辣味。
孜然羊筋串：肉質很嫩，但是沒有孜然味，整個羊騷味很重，也很油。
鹽烤豚五花肉串：就……很油的烤肉串。","There is a parking lot next to the restaurant. The indoor structure is pretty good. There are intervals between the table and the table. Although the seat space is not large, the sound of at least the chat will not interfere with each other next door.
But the part of the meal is very average. The meal this time is as follows:
Japanese -style salmon fried rice: It is ordinary salmon fried rice, but the salmon meat is small and small, but the taste is OK.
Cow tomato Zisu ice plum sauce: normal level.
Ginger Clam Soup: About 6 to 7 clams!The soup is not particularly delicious, but at least there is no fishy smell.
Sturded fishefish fins, the side meat of the fish: This is the only meal for dining this time. There are red ginger next to the sushi, and there are more mustard, but there is no spicy flavor of mustard.
Cumin sheep skewers: The meat is very tender, but there is no cumin smell.
Salt grilled dolphin pork belly skewers: Just ... very oily barbecue skewers."

"2021/12/4
我常在居酒屋用餐小酌，這是我第四次到這家店內用餐，這天我踩雷了……
1.可能客人較多，送餐速度很慢，連飲料酒品還要告知店員3次才送。
2.一般餐點送達會立即在餐券上劃掉，而不會靠店員記憶力，一口氣劃掉，幸好聚餐友人未飲酒，隨即發現有多劃(含價格520的綜合壽司等)，及酒類數量錯誤問題(價差)。
3.女兒點了一份鮭魚卵軍艦(160)，與平價的爭X相較，有130的價差，實在令人咋舌。
4.我們可以接受缺食材無法提供餐點，但是無法接受打單後，告知店員沒送達後，才告知缺食材，店員態度是否應該懷著歉意主動告知，而不是理直氣壯的表示呢。
5.大多打單會依照點餐次數分別打單，加點會另外打單，不會整份重新打單，然後憑記憶再劃掉已送達，豈不是容易混淆且浪費時間呢。

雖然餐點不錯，但這次用餐經驗實在令人失望。","2021/4
I often in the izakaya dining small, surrendered my fourth time to the house in the store dine, surrendered to the sky I stepped on the mine ...
1. Maybe more customers, very slow delivery speed, even beverage and wine tastings must be told the clerk 3 times to deliver.
2. General meal delivery will immediately be in the meal vouchers on, and will not rely on the clerk memory, a sigh of debris, fortunately gathering friends have not drink alcohol, immediately found more than the plan (including price 520 arc comprehensive sushi, etc.), and wineQuantity error problems (price difference).
3. The daughter pointed out a salmon egg warship (160), compared to cheap X X, with 1300 rates difference, realistic.
4. I can accept the lack of ingredients can not provide meals, but after the order, tell the clerk after the delivery, the shopkeeper attitude should not apologize the initiative to inform, and do not say that the straight air indicates.
5. Most orders will be ordered separately according to the number of orders, add how to order separately, will not make a whole re-order, and then with the memory and then drop it has been sent, the sieter is easy to confuse and waste time.

Although the meals are bad, the survivors of the dining experience are disappointing."

位子很擠（不要坐門口左側位子，每次有人進來都會被自動門夾到衣服，而且哪裡有鐵門開關，真的不怕有人無聊到去碰它嗎？😂），東西不便宜，而且我們5:30進門，到6:30東西才上來5件（還有一半還沒上來啊⋯⋯😰，而我們吃到7:40）上菜速度非常慢，炙燒壽司還是很生魚片那種的😓，花2000多四個人都吃不飽，而且每樣東西都沒有到很好吃，又很貴，除了用餐環境裝潢蠻特別，海膽還不錯吃外，之後應該不會過來了😂。 …,"The seat is very crowded (don't sit on the left side of the door, every time someone comes in, you will be caught by the automatic door to the clothes, and where is the iron door switch, isn't it afraid that someone is bored to touch it?

超可怕肉串一定要點，巨無霸握壽司不錯，整體來說不難吃，店家也很用心製作料理，但我相信可以更好，肉質的部分，不然這個位置換太多店家了，希望鳥居町可以繼續下去。,"The super terrible meat skewers must be more, the giants are good to hold sushi, it is not unpalatable overall, the store is also very careful to make dishes, but I believe it can be better, meat quality, otherwise there are too many shops in this position, I hope the birds will be changed.居 町 can continue."
還可以😌但覺得飯跟魚肉有點硬,"You can also sting, but feel that rice and fish are a bit hard"
經濟實惠，覺得還不錯吃～,"Economy, I think it's pretty good ~"
餐點很好吃 服務也很到位 幾乎每個禮拜都會來吃 但今天有一桌帶鳥進來 很吵 店家去勸說也無效 去年也遇到這組人 希望下次不要再遇到類似的情況了,"The meal is delicious and the service is very good. Almost every week will come to eat, but today a table with a bird coming in is very noisy."

以前點生啤都是大杯 現在變成用小的杯子裝。以前來會主動來到茶水，現在來沒有一次會主動來加茶水，都要跑到店員旁邊跟他說才會來，說了3次還是不會主動來。要點餐明細也不給，感受很差不會再來。,"In the past, the raw beer was now a small cup.

隱藏在台北東湖巷子裡面的日式居酒屋。外觀看起來不太顯眼，但走進去店家，你會發現處處都有老闆的裝潢小巧思與道地的日式風味料理。這次用餐，開頭先點了廣島炸牡蠣，剛炸好的牡蠣，外表裹著爽脆的麵衣，一口咬下～先享受到牡蠣帶著大海的鮮味，衝擊第一波味蕾，接著領教牡蠣的肥美與油溫控制的剛剛好，讓牡蠣不會太乾，這需要完美的控制油溫，才不枉費廣島名物「炸牡蠣」的名聲。再配上綿密細緻感十足的生啤酒，真不愧為居酒屋料理必點頭陣雙絕！中間還有點了明太子雞肉，解油膩的醃漬高麗菜（菜名忘了）、牛肉串。牛肉串最怕烤的太久，牛肉的「肉」香味烤到沒有，食之無味。這間的牛肉串吃入嘴裡，牛肉的緊實感加上滿嘴肉香味，也是堪稱一絕料理。最後還點了一盤照片裡的烤牛肉。這個要注意，肥肉偏多，但是！外皮烤的焦香與透紅的牛肉組合起來，再加上肥肉，三位一體，更可以讓這道烤牛肉，完全體的呈現出來，所以他的肥肉我給過！這間餐廳非常推薦給想放鬆的朋友們。,"The Japanese -style izakaya hidden in the alley in Donghu, Taipei.The appearance does not look conspicuous, but when you walk into the store, you will find that there are small and authentic Japanese -style dishes with bosses everywhere.At the beginning of dining, I ordered Hiroshima fried oysters at the beginning. The freshly fried oysters were wrapped in crispy noodles on the outside. The fat and oil temperature of the oysters are just right, so that the oysters will not be too dry. This requires the perfect control of the oil temperature, so as not to bother the reputation of Hiroshima's famous ""fried oysters"".With the dense and meticulous beer, it is really worthy of nodding in the izakaya cuisine!There is also a little prince chicken in the middle, and the greasy pickled cabbage (forgotten) and beef skewers.The beef skewers are most afraid of roasted for too long, and the ""meat"" fragrance of beef is grilled.The beef skewed into the mouth. The tightening of the beef and the flavor of the mouth are full of meat.Finally, ordered a plate of grilled beef in the photo.Pay attention to this, there are too many fat, but!The coking fragrance of the outer skin is combined with the red -red beef, plus fat, the trinity, can make this grilled beef, fully present it, so I have given his fat!This restaurant is very recommended to friends who want to relax."
"朋友意外約的，說評價不錯！
先不說食物，我覺得服務人員的態度都非常好！
再來是食物，先說居酒屋的食物本身就不便宜，但吃過多件間的居酒屋，第一次點墨魚香腸是給串的，當下有嚇到也無語，因為吃過這道菜幾乎都是整盤的那種😬

孜然羊肉串超級鹹，炒水蓮炒得超老，超長雞肉串超甜，點了炒飯店員漏點，上菜速度慢，店員上菜一直上錯桌，跟店員反應隨便敷衍就走掉了，毛毛蟲等了半小時直接不要了，除了吃生魚片跟炸牛蒡其他吃一兩口就不吃了，真的史上最糟糕用餐經驗,"Cumin lamb skewers are super salty, fried lotus lotus fried is super old, super long chicken skewers are super sweet, ordered the fried restaurant clerk to miss the point, the food is slow, the clerk has been on the table, and the clerk reacts with the clerk. It is not necessary to wait for half an hour to wait for half an hour. Except for eating sashimi and fried beef grucs, I do n’t eat one or two other bites. The worst meal experience in history"

很棒耶，讓我有點相見恨晚，綜合握壽司肉厚又好吃，鹽烤雞腿串肉厚多汁表皮酥脆香，顏靠烤五花豬跟明太子雞翅來不及拍剩下殘骸，這間晚上嘴饞一定要來，而且老闆人很好阿,"It's great, let me see each other a little late, the comprehensive holding sushi meat is thick and delicious, the salt -grilled chicken leg skewers are thick and juicy, the skin is crispy and fragrant. Must come at night, and the boss is very good"
"感覺被Google的四顆星評價騙進來的.........

就像下面說的，口味是很主觀的，以下是我個人的想法，希望老闆不要玻璃心、不要調監視器、更不要說要告我，謝謝

1.食物真的等太久太久了！現場也沒有坐滿，如果有湯類或是能快速出菜的先上（如果湯也是現做的我也沒話說）隔壁兩桌的人也在抱怨上菜太慢。
以我自己的想法，我覺得等的有點久，吃完一個又要等一陣子、吃完一個又要等一陣子，這樣不行阿～因為我看也有接外送單跟外帶，如果入座前可以告知現在出餐會有點慢，我可以摸摸鼻子下次再來，因為我這次去的當下真的很餓

2.不管炸的或是烤的，都超級油！感覺沒有瀝油就出菜了。
以我自己的想法，感覺都在吃油，可能單子太多急著出菜也有可能

3.甜的東西中間就上了，這讓我有點傻眼，不過也有可能大家都可以甜甜鹹鹹交換吃。
以我自己的想法，我覺得，如果因為作業的關係中間就上，可以點餐時告知客戶有可能中間就上甜的；又或是因為作業時間會久一點，告知客戶若要後上甜的，希望可以xx分鐘前告知。因為一般人都會覺得甜的都是後上，吃完甜的後面我都不想吃了～

以上三點是我自己的想法，畢竟之前也有做過餐飲業，流程的快速能讓翻桌也快、客戶吃的快也會繼續加點（因為酒還很多）、上菜太慢酒都喝飽了～希望老闆改善也能生意興榮才撐的久

不得不說餐點便宜、蛤蜊薑絲湯好喝所以給一顆星、也沒收服務費但是上菜的阿姨很客氣，付錢沒有收服務費有點意外👍","I feel that I was deceived by Google's four stars.

Just like the following, the taste is very subjective. The following is my personal thought. I hope the boss will not be glass -hearted, not to adjust the monitor, let alone tell me, thank you

1. The food is really waiting too long!The scene was not full. If there are soups or can quickly produce food (if the soup is also made now, I have nothing to say), the two tables next door are complaining that the food is too slow.
With my own thoughts, I think I have waited for a long time. After eating one for a while, after eating one, I have to wait for a while. You can tell that it will be a bit slow to go to the meal now, and I can touch my nose next time, because I am really hungry now.

2. Whether fried or grilled, it is super oil!I feel that there is no food without diligent.
With my own thoughts, I feel that I am eating oil. May

3. The sweet thing is in the middle, which makes me a little dumbfounded, but it may be possible that everyone can exchange sweetly and salty.
With my own thoughts, I think that if the relationship is in the middle, you can tell the customer that the customer may be sweet when ordering; or because the operation time will be a little longer, inform the customer that if you want to get sweet after you want I hope that XX can be notified a minute ago.Because most people feel that the sweetness is up to the back, and I don't want to eat it after eating sweetly ~

The above three points are my own thoughts. After all, I have done the catering industry before. The process of the process can make the table faster, and the customers will continue to add points (because there are many wines). It's ~ I hope that the boss can improve the business for a long time

I have to say that the meal is cheap, the clam ginger soup is delicious, so give a star and confiscate the service fee, but the aunt who serves is very polite."

頭一次到這間店消費 整體來說 環境真的還不錯 上菜還蠻快的 不過真的要推薦的就是生鮮的部分了～本人非常的愛吃～尤其海膽吃起來 非常之鮮甜 還有生魚片及壽司😁😁 更是讚不絕口 下次一定還會推薦朋友一起來👍👍 …,"For the first time I arrived in this store for consumption as a whole, the environment is really good, but it is quite fast, but what I really want to recommend is the fresh part of it ~ I love it very much ~ Especially the sea urchin tastes very fresh and sweet Sashimi slices and sushi are even more praised next time I will recommend friends to come together ..."
氣氛很好的 很喜歡🥰🥰,"The atmosphere is very good, I like it 的 的 的 的 的"
"因為我們帶小鳥進來，聲音音頻影響到做冷盤的師傅，所以冷盤師傅不願意幫我做生魚片蛋糕、還有其他冷盤食物。
（建議師傅下次直接講很刺耳或是直接在門口寫禁止寵物，就不會有這樣不愉快的情形發生了）
還有我們後來進店半小時左右也把小鳥帶走了
就算吵只有發出一段又一段的聲音。
以下評論根據我幾年吃的感覺的評論：
但是在他還沒講之前熟食上上來就讓我發現烤類的食物到後面的熟食，讓我感覺很像只是川燙上來的，沒有烤的很熟，例如：杏包菇讓我吃起來只是燙一下，還有一些烤肉串也是跟之前來店吃的味道有變。
連湯也是沒有很好喝，之前的很鮮甜，有連湯端上來也都沒有放穩，我叫了3次才放，這樣翻倒會燙到人。

以下為1年前的評論：
天使紅蝦完全不行
看煮熟的樣子頭還黑色的
感覺就是放很兩天以上、不新鮮
（蝦子上回吃也是這樣）

串燒不應該集中一起上
還沒吃完都冷了

哪有服務人員倒茶倒滿杯
服務人員蠻親切的，多給一顆星","Because we took the birds in, the sound and audio affected the master of the cold disk, so the cold disk master was unwilling to help me make sashimi cakes, and other cold disk foods.
(It is recommended that the master said that the next time you are very harsh or write a prohibited pet directly at the door, there will be no such unpleasant situation)
And we later entered the store for about half an hour and took the birds away for about half an hour
Even if there is only a sound of the noise.
The following comments are based on the feeling I eat for several years:
But before he talked about the cooked food, it made me find that the baked foods came to the cooked food behind, which made me feel like just Sichuan hot. While hot, there are some barbecue skewers that have changed with the taste of eating before.
Even the soup was not very delicious. It was very sweet before, and even the soup was not stable. I called it 3 times to put it, so that I would be hot when I turned it over.

The following is a comment 1 year ago:
Angel red shrimp is not enough at all
Seeing the cooked look is still black
It feels like to put it for more than two days, not fresh
(The same is true of the shrimp to eat it on the back)

Skew boil should not be concentrated together
It's cold before eating

How can there be a service staff pour tea and fill the cup
The service staff is quite kind, give a star more"
"臨時起意來吃吃看
味道很不錯
超長雞腿串真的很長耶哈哈","Come and eat temporarily
The taste is very good
Super long chicken leg skewers are really longe, hahaha"
炒飯好吃！串燒醃肉可再入味些～,Frying rice is delicious!Skewers can be flavorful ~
氣氛好環境不錯好,The atmosphere is good and the environment is good
東西超好吃，服務員親切下次一定再訪。,"The things are super delicious, the waiter must visit again next time."
"東西好吃，美妹的服務也很好 💕
下次再來 😄","The things are delicious, and the service of Meimei is also very good
Come again next time 😄"
便宜好吃，尤其是生魚片，超值,"Cheap and delicious, especially sashimi, super -value"
東西好吃不貴，覺得可以再來,"It's delicious or expensive, I feel that I can come again"
好吃，服務人員態度很好,"It's delicious, the service staff attitude is very good"
價格公道，餐點好吃，分量大，服務好！,"Fair price, delicious meals, large amount, good service!"
來吃好幾次了，居酒屋平價來說物超所值了，這裡台北市耶，下班喝個酒，吃個晚餐爽啊！🥹,"I have come to eat several times. The izakaya is worth it. It is worthwhile. Here, it ’s good to drink a wine after get off work and eat dinner!Bleak"
服務好，出餐快,"Good service, fast meal"
"說真的食物不錯，吃了五次有了…
今天場控很差，隔壁桌斷續在吹口風琴，就覺得吵了，接著手機拿出來看影片播出聲音，或是熟客，服務生沒敢提醒，接著服務生送客大聲嚷嚷小三不小三的嬉鬧，也不顧慮其他用餐客人感受，有點失望，畢竟前幾次體驗滿分…
接著時不時來收餐盤，打擾到用餐，提醒了不要再來收，即將結束用餐要離開，沒想到在隔壁桌嚷嚷完的服務生沒兩分鐘又來，整個食不下嚥，索性草草結帳離開，只覺得可惜了間好店…
Google不准給新評價，只好沒收九個月前的紀錄，或許一個五星影響薄弱，但好歹讓自己記得今天這一餐…","Seriously, the food is good, I have eaten it five times ...
Today's field control is very poor. The table next door is intermittently blowing the wind piano, and I feel noisy. Then the mobile phone came out to watch the video broadcast, or the customer, the waiter did not dare to remind, and then the waiter sent the guests to loudly and the small three. I am a bit disappointed, and I do n’t worry about the experience of other meal guests.
Then come from time to time to collect the dinner plate, disturb the meal, and remind you not to collect it again. The meal is about to leave. I did not expect that the waiter who finished the table next door did not come again in two minutes. I just think it is a pity ...
Google is not allowed to give a new evaluation, so he has to confiscate the record of nine months ago. Perhaps a five -star influence is weak, but anyway, let yourself remember this meal today ..."
跟女兒來這家，看到這一盤特上生魚片上菜，簡直傻眼了，580元這麼大一盤欸……,"When I came to this family with my daughter, I saw this set of sashimi slices and meals, which was dumbfounded. 580 yuan was so big ..."
招待熱茶、物美價實在，晚餐時間記得預約！,Entegle hot tea and products. Remember to make an appointment for dinner time!
老闆很親切 ～ 東西也新鮮很有氣氛的小店🤗 …,The boss is very kind ~ things are also fresh and atmospheric shops 🤗 ...
服務非常好，人員都很輕切，請老闆加薪，但價格偏貴，真的沒有吃到一樣好吃的，作為東湖唯一的居酒屋表現這樣真的很可惜，建議要來的人壽司跟丼飯都不要點，頂多點個烤串手捲，然後點啤酒來喝，坐一下聊聊天就好，但還是希望老闆可以正視美味的問題～改善後必定生意更好！還是要再說一次店員的服務態度真的都很好，值得鼓勵！,"The service is very good. The staff are very light. Please ask the boss to raise the salary, but the price is expensive. It really is not as delicious as it is. It is really a pity that the only izakaya performance in Donghu. Don't order meals. At most, order a skewed hand roll, and then order beer to drink. Just sit and chat, but you still hope that the boss can face up to the delicious problem ~ It is better to improve the business after improvement!I still have to say that the service attitude of the clerk is really good, it is worth encouraging!"
因應疫情的外帶便當，日式叉燒，120，還不錯，有七片，櫻花蝦飯沒什麼蝦味，小偏貴。,"In response to the epidemic take -off bento, Japanese -style pork roasted, 120, not bad, there are seven slices, cherry blossom shrimp rice has no shrimp flavor, small partial."
"用外送點了鮭魚炒飯和蛤蜊湯，炒飯好吃但真的太太太油了～～碗底直接積一層油，嚇到😵‍💫
蛤蜊湯好喝！ …","Send some salmon fried rice and clam soup with out. The fried rice is delicious, but the wife is really too oily ~~ The bottom of the bowl directly accumulates a layer of oil, scared 😵‍💫
Clam soup is delicious!Mowing"
調味鹹淡適中，上菜速度很快！,"The seasoning is light and moderate, and the food is fast!"
很棒的慶生體驗，老闆的即興創意慶生料理，即便是一般用餐也可以很享受!!,"A great birthday experience, the boss's impromptu creative celebration can enjoy even general meals !!"
"星星數是用送可樂騙來的.
女店員會在廚房裡抽電子菸.
老闆算是親切.","The number of stars is cheated with cola.
Female clerks will smoke electronic cigarettes in the kitchen.
The boss is kind."
氣氛不錯的居酒屋，東西好吃,"Izakaya with good atmosphere, the things are delicious"
難得東湖有居酒屋！食物總類選擇很多，讚👍,"Rare to have izakaya in Donghu!There are many total food categories, praise 选择"
好吃美味！食材新鮮！大力推薦！,Delicious and delicious!Fresh ingredients!Great recommendation!
還不錯！很新鮮！生魚片超優！物超所值！,not bad!Very fresh!Green fish fillets are superior!Make -bearing worth it!
深夜還不錯的選擇，生魚片份量超足夠!,"The good choice late at night, the portion of sashimi is enough!"
好吃但是最愛的烤毛豆竟然没賣了！！！拜託放回菜單！,It is delicious but the favorite roasted chills are not sold!IntersectionIntersectionPlease put back the menu!
"東湖居酒屋最佳選擇！
氣氛好價格便宜！","The best choice for Donghu 居 居!
The atmosphere is cheap!"
食材非常新鮮、任何挑選之燒烤都有塗抹自調不同醬汁，真的美味極了，建議事先訂位(常客滿)。價位中上。整體CP值很高。值得到此用餐。抱歉星號沒注意應該是給4顆星(不是1顆星)在此更正。,"The ingredients are very fresh, and any selected barbecue has a self -adjustment of different sauces. It is really delicious. It is recommended to order in advance (commonly full).Price.The overall CP value is high.It is worth this meal.Sorry for the Star Number, it should be corrected here for 4 stars (not 1 star)."
服務人員態度親切，當日有許多家庭用餐，環境也還行，燈光較想像中的居酒屋稍亮一些些。 東西也還不錯吃，柚香大根稍鹹一些。,"The service staff has a kind attitude. There are many families dining on the day, and the environment is okay.Things are also good, and the big roots of grapefree are slightly salty."
動飯味道不錯，樣式滿多的,The rice tastes good and has a lot of style

CP值高，美味好吃，明太子起司蛋捲很特別,"CP value is high, delicious and delicious, Prince Ming's cheese egg roll is very special"
"第一次去是朋友聚會時候,覺得價格可以，種類多，也有炒物。
這一次跟家人 孩子去
發現菜單已變 單價變高。
老實說 整體而言
不親民，不適合家聚
續攤型
僅適合吃飽了
再去吃氣氛小酌之處。

如果續攤
就自己需把握追酒時段
營業時間算短。","When I went to a friend's party for the first time, I felt that the price was okay, there were many types, and there were also fried.
Go with family and children this time
It is found that the menu has changed the unit price and higher.
To be honest, overall
Not close to the people, not suitable for home gathering
Renewal
Only suitable for eating
Go and eat at the atmosphere.

If the stall
You need to grasp the time of chasing the wine yourself
The business hours are short."
第一次去本來印象還不錯 餐點也新鮮好吃 網路上看營業時間到11:30 11:05進去跟我們說最後點餐時間是11點 那網上不應該也更改時間嗎？害人白跑一趟 營業時間寫假的是不是,"For the first time, I was already impressed. The meal was fresh and fresh. The business hours were fresh and delicious. Looking at the business hours at 11:30 11:05, I told us that the last order time is 11 o'clock. Should you change the time online?Is the harmless running for business hours and writing a vacation"
高評價是洗出來的，餐點完全是與高價位不相符的中下品質,High evaluation is washed out.
環境沒有一般居酒屋那種溫馨感，喝酒聊天也就少了那種氣氛，菜色口味還不錯，在社區也能享受不同的餐飲。,"The environment does not have the warmth of izakaya. Drinking and chatting has less atmosphere. The taste of the dishes is not bad, and you can also enjoy different catering in the community."
"可能剛好遇到漁獲較高價的時候 生魚片有點小塊, 串燒類表現普通, 鮭魚炒飯蠻好吃的. 冰啤杯子是有冰過的.
店裡空間有稍做區隔, 蠻好聊天的不太會被隔壁桌干擾.
廁所一間. 不過因為桌數也不多所以沒遇到要等很久的狀況.","It may happen to happen to be a little small when the raw fish fillets are a little bit, and the skewers are ordinary. The salmon fried rice is pretty delicious. The ice beer cup has ice.
The space in the store has a little separation, which is not very good to chat with it.
There is a toilet. However, because the number of tables is not large, I have not encountered a long situation."
下班後帶10歲小朋友到這兒慶生小聚，感受到老闆的熱情，店員很親切服務周到。比較常點的鹽烤串燒、熱炒及炸物都很好吃，三不五時就會想到這家店來享受一下晚餐時光。,"After getting off work, I took a 10 -year -old child to celebrate the birthday and felt the enthusiasm of the boss. The clerk was very thoughtful.The relatively common salt baked skewers, hot frying, and fried materials are delicious. It will be thought of this shop to enjoy dinner time from three or five o'clock."
"和風沙拉-每口沙拉蔬果都有醬汁，但又不會過鹹，作法用心

炒水蓮，整個過老，沒有新鮮翠嫩的感覺

烤羊小排-烤的鮮嫩適中，沾黃芥茉後，令人驚豔的味道...

手卷及和風唐揚雞表現中規中矩

生魚片擺盤賞心悅目，都非常新鮮，海鮮的甜味都在其中

原本不愛吃稻禾壽司，朋友勸進吃了1個，立刻驚為天人，跟服務人員了解原來是豆皮是日本進口，對稻禾壽司完全改觀.....(完全不乾柴，很溼潤，口感微甜)

海大蝦天婦羅，含油量實在太高，配菜直接捨棄不吃，尚有改進空間

服務人員都很親切，廁所也很乾淨","Hefeng salad-every salad fruits and fruits have sauce, but it will not be too salty.

Stir -fried lotus lotus, the whole is too old, there is no fresh and tender feeling

Baked sheep steak-grilled tender and moderate, after the yellow mustard is stunned, the stunning taste ...

Hand rolls and wind Tang Yang chicken performance is quite satisfactory

The raw fish fillets are pleasing to the eye, they are very fresh, and the sweetness of seafood is among them.

Originally did not like to eat Daoshis sushi, my friend advised to eat one, and was immediately shocked to heaven. He learned from the service staff that it was imported from Japan. Very wet, slightly sweet)

The service staff are very kind, and the toilet is also very clean"
"以下評論以前都有不管是服務品質、餐點品質、環境品質，在今天9/6晚上6:10至7:00，都沒了。
1.以前服務生都會上麥茶這次咧?就放我在那邊乾等。
2.以前餐廳音樂從我腳踏進去到離開，音樂都是流暢不會卡，這次咧?卡到爆，店內員工也沒人去處理。
3.醬燒雞腿肉{蔥}串品項名稱都有蔥字了這次咧?蔥咧?所以那個蔥咧?沒了(那個感熱紙還放在雞腿串下面，服務生拉出來都看到紙變油油的上面的字還有點糊掉，記憶雞腿串???)。
餐廳心臟也很大顆晚宴服務生也只有一個人，點菜的時候，我飲品的menu連動都沒動，看到明細表[梅子酒$150]????，這個問題還好，服務生的處理方式也跟其他餐廳一樣我沒點的就劃掉，不過像這種會收服務費的餐廳正常應該是重新開一張明細表吧?結帳的時候，果不其然跟我收梅子酒的錢，最後讓我打這一篇的最後一根稻草是聽到[有收10%服務費]，我被服務到了甚麼?茶從頭到尾都沒給我上，有幫我的也只有上餐點的部分，只有這個動作大部分沒收服務費的餐廳都會!我知道這家都會收服務費前提是沒有發生今天這些足以判死刑的狀況，啊，餐廳內部每桌都有人在等餐點，老闆你還有那個時間罵服務生啊?我隔壁桌是個老外，從他講4.7point star就感覺不對勁了，到後面就聽到一堆complain complain，坦白說若不是系統要至少1顆星才能發評論，不然你這家店根本沒那個價值。","In the following comments, no matter whether it is service quality, meals, and environmental quality, it is gone at 6:10 to 7:00 today from 9/6.
1. In the past, the waiter would go to wheat tea this time? Let me put me over there.
2. In the past, the restaurant music came from my foot to leave, and the music was smooth and not stuck.
3. Roasted chicken leg meat {}} skewers' names are onion. The words above the paper to become oil are a bit confused, remembering chicken legs skewers ???).
The restaurant's heart is also very large. The waiter in the dinner also has only one person. When ordering, the menu of my drink did not move. Seeing the details [plum wine $ 150] ???? The processing method also draws it if I don't order it like other restaurants, but the restaurant that can collect service fees like this should be a detailed table? When checking out, it is not the money to collect the money of plum wine with me. In the end, let me make the last straw of this article. I heard [10%of the service fee]. What did I be served? I did n’t give me the tea from my head to the end. In the part, only the restaurant that confiscates the service fee for most of this action! I know that this service fee will be charged. The premise is that there is no situation that it is enough to sentence the death penalty today. Ah, every table inside the restaurant is waiting for meals. There was also a time to scold the waiter? I was a foreigner next to my table. From his talk about 4.7point Star, I felt wrong. I heard a bunch of complain complains later. Frankly, if the system was not at least 1 star to comment, you could comment. Otherwise, your shop has no value at all."

東湖好地方，值得一來再來,"East Lake is good, it is worthwhile to come again"
從很久已一直來，但這次來完全不一樣、先說菜單改了，少了很多選擇，再細看，價格怎貴了那麼多？以前cp 值很高，每次都吃到飽飽，但這次，錢付多了，還没有什麼飽肚感。再細看前面的留言，原來老闆換了，怪不得進去時怪怪、以前平日晚上都很多客戶，很熱鬧，但這次，很冷清。,"I have been here for a long time, but this time it ’s completely different. Let’ s say that the menu has been changed. There are many choices. Then look at it. How is the price so much?In the past, the CP value was very high, and I was full every time, but this time, the money was paid too much, and there was nothing full.Looking at the previous messages, the boss changed. No wonder it was strange when entering. There were many customers on weekdays and night, but this time, it was very deserted."
"晚上用餐，等了50分鐘餐點還沒上
突然服務生走來說收單時出了錯誤
麻煩我們重新畫單

等等，我是不是誤會了什麼？
如果是滿桌的狀況下廚房出餐不及都可以接受，可是當下只有三組客人
你們的疏失導致客人乾等
到底是哪裡出了問題？
沒錯，店員補償了兩杯可樂給我
但我缺那兩杯可樂嗎？
我缺的是我的餐點啊！！！

等餐的過程中店員來加了好幾次茶連一句稍等跟關心都沒有，也沒有任何人發現為什麼遲遲沒有上菜？

如果今天我也沒有在中途離席一下刷個存在感，店員是否繼續聊天而不自知？

以一個等候五分鐘的餐點來說及格
但以等候一個小時的餐點，我覺得分數低得可憐

喔忘了說，還要收1成服務費
我不知道我被服務了什麼
你不說是日式料理，我還以為我來到喝茶喝到飽的餐廳","Dinner at night, wait for 50 minutes to eat
Suddenly the waiter went to say that there was an error when receiving the bill
Please re -draw the list

Wait, do I misunderstand something?
If the kitchen meals are not enough to accept the kitchen at full table, there are only three groups of guests at the moment
Your negligence causes guests to work, etc.
Where is the problem?
That's right, the clerk compensated me for two cups
But do I miss those two cups of cola?
What I lack is my meal!IntersectionIntersection

During the meal, the clerk came to add tea several times without waiting and care, and no one found why he was not serving?

If I did n’t have a sense of existence in the middle of the place today, do the clerk continue to chat without knowing it?

In terms of a meal waiting for five minutes
But waiting for an hour's meal, I think the score is so poor

Oh, forgot to say, it has to charge 10 % of the service fee
I don't know what I was served
Don't say it is a Japanese cuisine, I thought I came to the restaurant where I came to drink tea"
"以前常去覺得每個食物都好好吃好開心
不論海鮮丼烤串炸物都好吃
但今天去吃了蔥花鮪魚蠔膽丼..裡面的海膽味道可怕的驚人！我印象中的蔥花鮪魚是剁碎的但它是塊狀鮪魚…而且今天烤雞串也不多汁很乾柴…
不知道今天怎麼了🥲","I used to think that every food was delicious, so happy
No matter the seafood baked skewers are delicious
But today I went to eat green onion catfish oysters .. The sea urchin in it was terrible and amazing!The green onion catfish in my impression is chopped but it is a piece of catfish ... and today the grilled chicken skewers are not juicy and very dry ...
I don’t know what's wrong today."
"之前常來這家日料吃，但料理的口味漂浮不定有一點失望………店裡的氣氛也不是特別好，出餐速度慢就算了，時不時還會聽到店長在罵人的聲音，整體觀感很差
今天偶然路過想說吃一下好了，發現經營團隊換過了，料理的口味跟以前差蠻多的
很好吃，店內的氣氛也比之前舒服很多🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤","I used to come to this Japanese food before, but the taste of the cuisine is not disappointed ... The atmosphere in the shop is not particularly good, even if the meal speed is slow. From time to time Poor observation
I accidentally passed by today and wanted to say that I had eaten it. I found that the operating team was changed.
It's delicious, the atmosphere in the store is much more comfortable than before."
"1.北海道干貝握手司兩貫120TWD，品質比連鎖迴轉壽司還普通，壽司飯不是醋飯，是白米飯，然後還是熱的

2.豬五花肉串就是早餐店吃到的醃漬過的豬肉排味

3.鮭魚炒飯雖有鍋香氣但只有鮭魚肉末

4.豆皮壽司的飯也是熱的白米飯，不是醋飯，很奇怪

總體來說口味難吃，價格卻很貴，CP值非常低","1. Hokkaido dried scallion handicrafts 120TWD, quality is more common than chain rotary sushi. Sushi rice is not vinegar rice, it is white rice, and then it is hot.

2. Pork pork belly skewers are marinated pork sowing tastes eaten by the breakfast shop

3. Although salmon fried rice has a pot of aroma, only salmon meat

4. The rice sushi rice is also hot white rice, not vinegar rice, very strange

"以前很常來吃 一個禮拜至少會來2次以上
那個時候是真的很好吃 所有服務都可以給到五星評價 這一次隔了快一個月來吃 發現前全部都不一樣了 菜單改的跟外面很像 普普通通 服務人員態度也不好 食物也大退步
真的是只剩一顆星","I used to eat at least twice a week very often for a week.
At that time, it was really delicious. All services can be given to the five -star evaluation. This time, it is different before eating for almost a month. The menu is not the same as that of the Menu. Retreat
There is really only one star left"
東西等很久，很久，講了也不見積極反應。生意不錯時要有心理準備，師傅感覺在裡面很辛苦，外場倒是不太知道如何安排內用順序較適當。價格偏高，泡菜小菜清湯均須額外付費，但生魚片握壽司及鍋貼好吃，其他串烤則普通。,"I have been waiting for a long time, for a long time, and I have no positive response after talking.When the business is good, you must be mentally prepared. The master feels that it is very hard in it. The outside field does not know how to arrange the order in the order.The price is high, kimchi soups must be paid additional, but the sashimi slices and pot stickers are delicious, and other skewers are ordinary."

"經過很多次終於來吃，週五晚上8點初電話先詢問過訂位，原本預計要等45分鐘，但後來8:30左右接到電話通知有補到位子，服務人員反應即時而且親切

小小建議是人員巡場可以再多看一下有沒有客人有需要，畢竟隔間可能會擋到彼此視線～","After many times, I finally came to eat, and I asked the reservation at 8 o'clock on Friday night. I was expected to wait 45 minutes, but then I received a call from the call at about 8:30.

鮭魚炒飯份量很足夠CP值高,The amount of salmon fried rice is enough for CP value high

"很失望 東西真的不是那麼好吃
海鮮腥味太重了
最後結帳才知道加服務費（水都沒上自己去到了兩次）
希望店家要改進
沒拍照是因為本來不想評分 但結帳的感覺實在太差。","Very disappointed, it's really not so delicious
The fishy smell is too heavy
The last checkout did not know that the service fee was added (the water did not go to the water to go twice)
I hope the store will improve
I did n’t take a picture because I did n’t want to score, but the feeling of checkout was too bad."
非常好吃且超值，上菜很快服務好，會常常想跟家人來這邊聚聚,"Very delicious and value -for -money, the serving is very good, and I often want to come to gather with my family here."
餐點好吃又便宜 老闆跟店員服務熱情 態度也很親切 店裡氣氛不錯 一定會再來,The meals are delicious and cheap boss and the clerk's service enthusiasm.
老闆為人阿沙力，客氣，推一個~,"The boss is Aisha, polite, push one ~"
菜單的資訊不夠詳細，沒有說明或附圖，店員也不介紹，點了餐時才知道有些品項已售完。貴但感覺不出為何值得這個價格。,"The information of the menu is not detailed enough, there is no instructions or attachment, and the clerk does not introduce it. When I order meals, I know that some items have been sold.It is expensive but it doesn't feel why it is worth this price."
真的很不好吃，非常不推，尤其串燒難吃到爆炸，唯一不嫌的只有啤酒而已，建議進店前三思。,"It's really not delicious, very not pushing, especially the skewers are unpleasant to explode. The only thing that is not suspected is beer. It is recommended to think twice before entering the store."
"東湖唯一居酒屋 沒話說了啦 歐伊係👍🏻👍🏻

今天我們來吃晚飯，我們必須等待 30 分鐘才能處理我們的訂單。前面的人一直不知道該做什麼。然後他忘了送我們一份飲料並且弄亂了一件物品。我們花了大約3000TWD。如果他們至少可以嘗試補償我們就好了。但他們不在乎。,"We come to dinner today, we must wait 30 minutes to process our orders.People in front have never known what to do.Then he forgot to send us a drink and messed up a piece of item.We spent about 3000TWD.If they can at least try to compensate us.But they don't care."
