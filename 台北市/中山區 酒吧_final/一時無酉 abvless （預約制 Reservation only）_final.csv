"這是一間無酒精的「酒吧」
一直都對這間店非常好奇，終於找到難得可以拜訪的時間
到來時剛好是今天第一組客人，有幸和老闆多聊幾句，了解了這裡的點單方式就像一般去酒吧點酒的方式一樣，告訴老闆喜歡的口味、感覺。接下來就是展現魔法的時刻了！
第一杯點了經典的Gin Tonic，一入口的沁涼和檸檬的香氣、微酸口感，根本喝不出這是有酒精還是無酒精
第二杯想要來點茶香風味，老闆推薦了本日特別的🍵香檳，一入口葡萄的香氛撲鼻而來，緊隨其後的是炭焙烏龍的獨特香氣，尾韻綿長令人回味，實在令人驚艷不已！
日式老宅的環境沒有太多浮誇的裝飾、改造，將精力和注意力都放在調飲本身，這樣的品飲經驗獨特且回味無窮，期待下次再訪！

記得不要No Show傷了老闆的心歐😂","This is a alcohol -free ""bar""
I have always been very curious about this shop, and finally I found a rare time to visit
When I arrived, it was just the first group of guests today. I was fortunate to talk to the boss a few words. I learned that the ordering here is just like the way to go to the bar to order wine. Tell the boss the taste and feeling that the boss likes.The next time is the time to show magic!
The first cup ordered the classic Gin Tonic, Qinliang and the aroma and sour taste of lemon at the entrance. Can't drink it at all.
The second cup wants to have some tea flavor. The boss recommends the special champagne today. It is amazing!
The environment of the Japanese -style house does not have much exaggerated decoration and transformation, and puts energy and attention in the tune itself. Such drinking experience is unique and endless. I look forward to visiting the next time!

"ㄧ直記錄在我Google 地圖的探險記錄上，但是一直沒有機會可以來探險，剛好今天去吃冰，就順道來了體驗一下，走路從九州純冰大概5分鐘就到了。

這家小酒館非常厲害，厲害的是他開店時間是白天，11:30-19:30。來的顧客可以選有酒精的飲料，也可以選無酒精的飲料，然後沒有酒單，想要喝什麼口味什麼喜好，只要告訴調酒師(老闆)，他就可以調出來，無酒精的部分他可以用替代品去調。

我非常喜歡這家店的氛圍，我可以在這邊待一整個下午，我剛去的時候店內有5位顧客，我估計店內可以坐到6人。

今天喝的是無酒精梅子酒加山楂，口感好特別。店內沒有東西可以吃，想吃東西他隔壁有一事製菓有點心可以買。

老闆阿明非常的有趣，很喜歡跟顧客聊天，他非常保護正在裡面享受喝酒氛圍的客人，我那時候跟他聊天聊到一半， 有一對應該是男女朋友，走進來在東張西望看來看去也沒有講什麼，老闆就在瞪他們，因為老闆覺得他們這樣子東看西看很沒有禮貌。當下真的覺得自己有被尊重的感覺。

如果想要一個人來靜一靜，或者是想來喝無酒精的調酒，又想要找人聊聊天，我覺得都很適合來這個地方，因為他真的很安靜，他沒有吵雜的音樂，沒有絢麗的燈光效果，他就是一個很舒服的環境讓你在那邊放空，又不會喝醉。","O ㄧ Belly recorded on the adventure record of my Google map, but there has been no chance to come to explore. Just to eat ice today, I will experience it by the way. Walking from Kyushu Chunbing for about 5 minutes.

What good tastes do you want to drink? As long as the bartender (boss) can be told, he can adjust it. He can use alternatives to adjust.

I like the atmosphere of this shop very much. I can stay here for a whole afternoon. When I first went, I had 5 customers in the store. I estimated that the store could sit in 6 people.

Today, I drink alcoholic plum wine and hawthorn, which has a good taste.There is nothing to eat in the store. If you want to eat something, there is one thing to make fruits to buy next door.

The boss Amin is very interesting and likes to chat with customers. He is very protected by the guests who are enjoying the drinking atmosphere. I chatted with him at that time. There was a pair of men and women. I didn't say anything, the boss was staring at them, because the boss felt that they looked at it like this.At the moment, I really feel that I feel respected.

"除夕夜，我走進了台北中山區的一顆隱藏的寶石，亞洲第一家無酒精酒吧 abvless。坐落在一座百年老建築裡，感覺就像回到了過去🕰️。

創辦人小白創造了一個只有六個座位的私密空間，在這裡每杯飲料都是對話。我沉迷於卡爾榮格的各種無酒精雞尾酒和無酒精葡萄酒，每種都是獨特的口味混合。

設計的靈感源自於侘寂美學，並增添了魅力，使我的訪問成為難忘的體驗。","On New Year's Eve, I walked into a hidden gem in Zhongshan District, Taipei, and the first alcoholic bar in Asia ABVLess.Located in a century -old building, it feels like returning to the past 🕰️.

The founder Xiaobai created a private space with only six seats, where each drink is a dialogue here.I am obsessed with Karoner's various alcohol -free cocktails and wine -free wine, each of which is a unique flavor mixed.

The inspiration of the design comes from the aesthetics of silence and adds charm, making my interview a unforgettable experience.",0.162,0.016,0.822,0.9382
舒適的無酒精雞尾酒酒吧，一個不錯的度假勝地。飲料每份300-400美元。沒有菜單，你只需解釋你想要什麼味道或風味，然後調酒師就會為你調製一些東西。,"Comfortable wine -free cocktail bar, a good resort.Drinks each $ 300-400.Without a menu, you just need to explain what the taste or flavor you want, and then the bartender will make some things for you.",0.258,0.0,0.742,0.8689

"這是朋友分享的真實經驗。
An less是一家非常特別的酒吧，靠近捷運中山站，以其熱鬧的夜生活、高檔的餐廳和酒吧而聞名。

這家酒吧是由一棟老房子改建而成的，老闆的裝潢很有創意，空氣中瀰漫著輕鬆的氣氛。

沒有菜單，店主很自豪能夠製作任何你能想到的飲料，包括酒精或非酒精飲料。然而，我們嘗試了肉桂蘋果雞尾酒，但沒有成功；荔枝呢？沒有。

最終，我點了最常見的一種，桑格里拉，不是我通常品嚐的典型桑格里拉，甚至遠非如此，而是像霞多麗和白葡萄酒的混合。

花了 300 美元+ 10%！我想說這個地方很舒適，適合喝茶或與朋友聚會。但如果你想要令人印象深刻，那麼飲料的價格就太高了。","This is a real experience shared by friends.
An LESS is a very special bar, close to the MRT Zhongshan Station, and is known for its lively nightlife, high -end restaurants and bars.

This bar was converted from an old house. The boss's decoration was very creative, and the air was filled with a relaxed atmosphere.

Without a menu, the owner is proud to make any drinks you can think of, including alcohol or non -alcoholic drinks.However, we tried cinnamon apple cocktails, but it was not successful; what about litchi?No.

In the end, I ordered the most common one. Sangri -La was not a typical Sangri -La I usually tasted.

It cost $ 300+ 10%!I want to say that this place is very comfortable, suitable for drinking tea or meeting with friends.But if you want to be impressive, the price of the drink is too high.",0.161,0.025,0.814,0.9543
