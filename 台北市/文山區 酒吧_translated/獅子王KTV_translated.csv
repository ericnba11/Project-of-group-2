"包廂及環境都很舒適
餐點也很多樣 很好吃
包廂的內有廁所 不用到外面擠人 很棒","The box and the environment are very comfortable
The meals are also very delicious
There is a toilet inside the box, so I don’t need to be crowded outside"
"很多歌很奇妙，沒正式版本或台灣歌但給簡體字字幕，還有出現只有mv畫面+無字幕，一度懷疑我只是在家用投影；也有遇到開導唱沒人聲、伴唱才有，不確定是不是設定有誤；搜尋方式也沒有很準確，用人找歌或用歌找人不一定找得到，要多試試幾個。
小優點是有很多大KTV沒有的冷門歌、廁所乾淨、包廂會定時噴芳香除臭(沒有到過敏不舒服的濃度)

當天點了青菜豆腐湯、蛤蜊湯、澎大海，青菜豆腐湯的豆腐吃起來有怪味，可能保溫很久，但菜跟湯是正常的；蛤蜊滿多的；澎大海正常發揮，一壺應該1-2人份。

週六中午4小338+150低消/人+10%服務費+廁所清潔費100/包廂

整體來說，這個價格不太值得，一次店。
消費時間：2024/10/19","Many songs are wonderful. There are no formal versions or Taiwanese songs, but to simplified subtitles, there are only MV pictures+no subtitles, once suspected that I was projected at home; It is not that the setting is wrong; the search method is not very accurate. Finding a song or using a song may not find it. Try a few more.
The small advantage is that there are many unpopular songs that big KTVs do not have, clean toilets, and the box will spray aromatic deodorization regularly (without concentration of allergies and uncomfortable)

On the same day, I ordered green vegetable tofu soup, clam soup, and Peng sea. The tofu of green vegetable tofu soup has a strange taste, which may be warm for a long time, but the vegetables and soup are normal; -2 people.

Saturday noon 338+150 low/person+10%service fee+toilet cleaning fee 100/box

On the whole, this price is not worth it, once a store.
Consumption time: 2024/10/19"
"一開始打電話去問費用的時候
只說一個人多少錢及低消
到了現場又問了一次也一樣的說法
最後結帳的時候才加了一成服務費及廁所清潔費???
不是缺那個錢但能不能一開始就講清楚啊
而且服務費跟廁所清潔費到底是差在哪
只會投機取巧還不如直接算在人頭費用==
然後兩個人低消買一壺奶茶就不夠了
要水也沒有只有賣礦泉水
無線麥克風唱到一半還沒電
最後就是確認費用的時候服務生態度也很差","At first I called to ask the fee
Just talk about how much money and low disappear
When I arrived at the scene, I asked again
Only when the final checkout was at the checkout, the service fee and the cleaning fee of the toilet was added ???
It’s not missing that money, but can you make it clear from the beginning?
And where is the service fee and the cleaning fee of the toilet?
It is better to speculate on the head cost of the head ==
Then it is not enough to buy a pot of milk tea in low disappearance
There is no water for water, but only selling mineral water
Wireless microphone singing is half without power
The last is to confirm that the service is also very poor when the cost"
"1、前一天就預約，到場櫃檯是一位中年女子接洽，準時到現場還要等近20分鐘，跟我差不多時間到的人，甚至比我晚到的人都先帶位了，還說有先跟我講要打臭氧，並沒有，只叫我稍等，我都不知道要等什麼，朋友到了又詢問，才講要打臭氧，怕有煙味，所以包廂是可以抽菸？如果我沒預約我會乖乖的等，還拗說她們員工12:00才上班，請問關我什麼事？我還要負責管理妳們員工的上班時間？還要負責教妳們上班前該做的事前準備？還要教妳們有預約的包廂要準時準備好？妳們的薪水我要不要順便幫妳領一領？這些要消費者承擔？要消費者吞下去？預約的意義在哪裡？可以調監視器出來看2024/10/2。

2、牌價看起來比$櫃、好樂d便宜，但低消比人家都高，還要收廁所清潔費，笑死，重點廁所也沒比人家乾淨，加上廁所清潔費其實價格沒有比較便宜，建議去$櫃、好樂d，想說沒來過也許不錯，果然踩雷。

3、麥克風沒有換電池，一進包廂1支麥克風就剩1格電，1支麥克風剩2格電，滿格為3格電，還沒唱完1支麥克風就沒電了，想說時間快到了就算了，最基本的工作也要做吧？

4、點歌系統感覺是大陸的，會有簡體字，搜尋功能很難用，用注音搜尋，跑出英文字母，因為大陸沒有注音，男歌手周杰倫，點歌系統顯示為周「傑」倫🤣。

5、有點飲料，連杯水都不肯給喔，要自己買他們的礦泉水，笑死我了。

6、兩個人去唱4小時，只點了一碗牛肉麵和一壺奶茶，花費共一千多。

結帳看開台員工及收銀皆為經理，我差點笑死，這種素質？這輩子不會再去了，天啊，嚇死我了","1. I made an appointment the day before. At the counter, a middle -aged woman was contacted. It took nearly 20 minutes to come to the scene on time. The person who arrived at about me at about the same time was that even those who arrived later than me. I told me about ozone first. There was no. I just waited for me. I did n’t know what to wait for. When my friend arrived, I asked, so I said that ozone was ozone. I ’m afraid of a smoke smell. So the box can smoke?If I didn't make an appointment, I would wait obediently, and I still said that their employees did not go to work at 12:00.I am still responsible for managing your employees' work hours?Do you also need to teach you what you should do before going to work?Do you want to teach you the box where you have an appointment should be prepared on time?Do you want to help you with your salary by the way?Do these consumers bear it?Want consumers to swallow?Where is the significance of the appointment?You can adjust the monitoring device to see 2024/10/2.

2. The price of the card looks cheaper than the $ cabinet and Haole D, but the low disappearance is higher than that of others. It also needs to collect the cleaning fee of the toilet, laughs to death, and the key toilet is not clean than others. In addition, the price of the toilet cleaning fee is actually cheaper. It is recommended to go to the $ cabinet, Holy D, and want to say that it may not be good before, and it really steps on the thunder.

3. The microphone does not change the battery. As soon as one microphone is entered into the box, 1 grid is left, 1 microphone is 2 grids, and the full grid is 3 grids. Even if it is, do you have to do the most basic job?

4. The singing system feels that it is in the mainland. There will be simplified characters. The search function is difficult to use. Search in phonetic phonetic and run out of English. Because the mainland does not have phonetic phonetic, male singer Jay Chou, the song system is displayed as Zhou ""Jie"" Lun 🤣.

5. There is a little drink, not even a glass of water, you want to buy their mineral water by yourself and laugh at me.

6. Two people sang for 4 hours, and only ordered a bowl of beef noodles and a pot of milk tea, which cost more than 1,000.

The employees and cash registers of the opening of the station at the checkout are all managers. I almost laughed to death. Is this quality?I won't go again in my life, God, scare me to death"

8個人訂10點半等到12點半才進去，只會在那裡說什麼因為颱風天怎麼樣的，自己量能根本沒控制好，然後8個人只能擠在容納4-5人的包廂，麥克風只有兩隻也不能多給，最討厭的是一個黑框眼鏡的前台講話口氣超級差跟流氓一樣，好像隨時要打人一樣，不想做就不要做，不會再去了，已檢舉。,"8 people ordered at 10:30 until 12:30, and they will only say what is because of the typhoon, and the amount can be controlled at all. Then 8 people can only squeeze in a box with 4-5 people. There are only two of them. The most annoying thing is that the front desk of a black -frame glasses is super bad. It seems to be like a hooligan at any time. Don't do it if you don't want to do it."
"昨天定位時說颱風假照假日入場費辦理一個人458四小時

到了之他們說他們大包滿了我們9個人要擠中包，進去之後發現他們中包根本跟錢櫃小包差不多大（有兩三個人要沒位子坐要站著的那種程度）他們反應坐不下送了一個超爛的炸物拼盤敷衍

同行友人發評論後跑來跟我們說，幫我們刪掉兩個人頭，請我們刪掉留言

帳單來之後發現上面多了亂打的價格，請服務員來解釋他說他不知道這是什麼，再說幫我們再減一位人頭

結完帳之後來跟我們說我們時間到了（我們才唱3個半小時） 服務員才跟我們說他們今天方案是三小時，已經多送我們半小時，問他為什麼價目表那邊四小時，現在卻說是三小時，啊那個價格表是假的嗎，店員跟我說對，笑死連這都可以騙這家店真的可以收一收

都2024怎麼會有店家還在亂打帳單亂改價目表坐地起價，我都快覺得我在什麼第三世界國家了，被發現之後才再說可以幫你打折，這種做生意的態度真的可以不用開了，而且更不用説打完折還是貴得要死，一個人快五百的價格，要擠在超小包廂還只能唱三小時，真的是可以收一收了！","Yesterday when positioning, it was said that the typhoon holiday fees were applied for a person 458 four hours.

When they arrived, they said that they were full of nine people to squeeze the central bag. After entering, they found that their bags were almost the same as the money cabinet bag (there were two or three people who had no seats to sit and stand). They could not sit down. Give a super rotten explosive platter perfunctory

After sending a comment, I came to tell us, help us delete the two heads, please delete the message

After the bill came, I found that there was a lot of messy prices. Please ask the waiter to explain that he didn't know what it was. Besides, help us reduce another head

After finishing the account, I came to tell us that our time has arrived (we only sang 3 and a half hours) The waiter told us that their plan today is three hours, and it has been sent to us half an hour. But it was three hours. Is that the price table is fake? The clerk tells me right. You can lie to this shop with laughter.

Du 2024 How could there be a shop still making the bill and randomly changed the price to sit on the ground. I almost felt that I was in the third world country. After being discovered, I can help you discount. Don't open it, let's not say that you have to die if you finish it. The price of a person is almost 500. You can only sing for three hours in the super small box. It can really be collected!"

怎麼沒0可以選啊⋯⋯⋯⋯一開始6個人給我們安排最小的包廂（有人座加的椅子）有人還得站著😅最後以為我們喝醉故意亂喊價⋯⋯⋯⋯拜託大家別來。收費特別不透明。。。每個店員說的價錢都不一樣😅誰來管管啊,"Why is there no 0? You can choose.

歌曲沒有太多新歌可以選擇….蠻可惜！","Cheap 👍
Beef noodles, chicken cartilage, oil chicken delicious 👍
There is no taste in the jinsha roll 金

There are not many new songs to choose from songs ... It's a pity!"
這邊什麼歌都沒有，然後餐點的味道都跟想像的不一樣，而且偏貴，六個人平均一人六百多，偏坑,"There is no song here, and the taste of the meal is different from imagined, and it is too expensive. The average of six people is more than 600 people, and the pit"
"禁帶外食的KTV（攜帶的話會酌收清潔費唷）

很多大陸歌、抖音歌、日韓歌，包廂算小但基本都有廁所。
環境整體來說偏老舊，不是設施問題，單純裝潢感覺很有年代，但其實很新哈哈哈。

覺得比較便宜才偶爾會過來，但最近一次消費居然一人將近一千元🤣（假日夜唱）","KTV that is restrained with food (if you carry it, you will collect the cleaning fee as appropriate)

Many mainland songs, Douyin songs, Japanese and Korean songs, the box is small but basically there are toilets.
The environment overall is old, not a facility problem, and the decoration feels very old, but it is actually very new hahaha.

I think it is cheaper and occasionally come here, but the recent consumption actually consumed nearly 1,000 yuan (holiday night singing)"
最喜歡跟姐姐們來這唱歌舒服又音質不錯,"I like to sing here with my sisters most, comfortable and good sound quality"
好評！價格合理！東西真的好吃😋,Praise!Reasonable price!Things are really delicious
"1.看照片這個外套鉤子這麼高我們笑好久
2.mv畫面模糊，有些歌沒有顯示歌詞，或原唱的人聲根本都還在
3.結束前半個小時進來收桌子不知道是趕什麼，出來一看一堆空房
4.禁帶外食就寄放了我們的外食在櫃檯，可是還是有收清潔費？不管怎樣就是要收清潔費，那就劃入歡唱費不就好了？
5.機器運轉聲超大，感覺像在機房裡唱歌
6.炒飯裡有大塊鹽塊
7.平日下午一個人500唱四小時，這價位大家聽到也是笑了
8.沙發椅子也不好坐，只是椅子上面補海綿，椅背呈90度直上，根本不是沙發

整體體驗真的荒謬到好笑。","1. Look at the photo, the hook is so tall, we laughed for a long time
2. MV screen is blurred, some songs do not show lyrics, or the original voices of the original singing
3. I do n’t know what to catch when I come in half an hour before the end.
4. The ban on outer food is stored at the counter, but there is a cleaning fee?In any case, it is to charge a cleaning fee, so it is not good to put it into the singing fee?
5. The machine runs very loud, it feels like singing in the computer room
6. There is a large piece of salt in the fried rice
7. On weekdays, one person sing 500 for four hours in the afternoon. Everyone laughed at this price.
8. The sofa chair is not easy to sit, but the sponge is supplemented on the chair, and the back of the chair is 90 degrees straight up, which is not the sofa at all

The overall experience is really ridiculous."
"跟朋友兩人一起去，包廂整體乾淨還都有單獨的廁所，因為帶了飲料所以多收100服務費
歌曲算是很多元了，中文有很多抖音的歌，英文新歌比較少，韓文也有
點歌系統稍微沒那麼好操作，雖然輸入中文但會跑出中國使用的拼音法
歌曲MV常常搭配其他的韓劇或是不相干的片段，字幕偶爾是簡體的，設備當然無法跟錢櫃那種大間的比
餐點部分，皮蛋瘦肉粥整體不錯（但皮蛋味道很腥），鹹酥雞推薦（剛炸好），乾拌麵非常不推薦點（肉燥沒味道，麵煮太軟有的卻還沒煮熟）","Go with friends, and there is a separate toilet in the box as a whole. Because of the drinking, the service fee is charged.
The song is considered a lot of yuan, there are many vibrato songs in Chinese, there are fewer English songs, and Korean also has
The singing system is not so easy to operate, although entering Chinese, it will run out of the Pinyin method used in China
The song MV is often paired with other Korean dramas or irrelevant fragments. The subtitles are occasionally simplified. Of course
For the meal part, the preserved egg lean porridge is good as a whole (but the preserved egg tastes very fishy), the salty crispy chicken is recommended (just fried), the dry noodles are very not recommended (the meat is dry and tasteless, but the noodles are too soft but not yet good, but not yet not yet. Cooked)"

"年初一
總共八位朋友要去唱歌，大家陸續到
我是第四個到，前面朋友已經唱30分鐘左右，我進去立刻發現包廂異常的小……（請看照片）然後要求換包廂，不然我們八個屁股也不可能做的下…
結果等了10幾分鐘，遲遲沒得到任何消息….後來再次到櫃檯要求換包廂，結果，服務人員說：等你們全部都到齊再幫你們換！

我黑人問號？為什麼不能現在就先換呢？
我們其他朋友是確定有要來的喔！
她還是一副很忙不想理我們的樣子！一直滑鼠按來按去….
後來我就說，算了！我們不唱了，幫我們結帳可以吧？她再次說：等你們全部人都到了我再幫你們安排換包廂！
我說：如果等下大家都到了，你跟我們說沒包廂了，我們到時候不唱，是不是超過一個小時，又要算兩個小時了？！
結果他們說好，那就幫你們結帳，讓我們回包廂等。
到了55分鐘的時候，還不進來給帳單…
我們再次前往櫃檯要求結帳，他們才不情願的給了帳單！
一看！傻眼！！上面寫包廂計費1250+10%
常常唱歌的各位，你們真的覺得這是中大包廂嗎？
冷笑😏被坑無誤！
仔細看，左一朋友的腳跟椅子是齊平，表示左邊根本無法再坐人喔….這是中大包……….嗎？呵呵，真的是誰去誰倒霉…","One year of the year
A total of eight friends are going to sing, everyone will come one after another
I am the fourth, my friends have sang for about 30 minutes, I went in and found out that the box was very small ... (please see the photo) and then asked for changing the box, otherwise it would be impossible for us to do it ...
As a result, I waited for 10 minutes, and I did n’t get any news .... Later, I went to the counter to ask for a box again. As a result, the service staff said: When you all come to Qi, help you change it!

My black question mark?Why not change it now?
The other friends of our friends are sure there is something to come!
She is still very busy and ignorant of us!Press the mouse and press ...
Later I said, forget it!Let's not sing anymore, can we check the checkout?She said again: When all you are here, I will help you arrange a box change!
I said: If everyone is here, you tell us that there are no boxes. When we do n’t sing, do we have more than one hour, and it takes another two hours?Intersection
As a result, they said yes, then help you checkout and let us return to the box.
By 55 minutes, don't come in to give the bill ...
We went to the counter again to ask for checkout, and they gave the bill reluctantly!
Take a look!Dumb!IntersectionThe chart of the box is 1250+10% above
Everyone who often sings, do you really think this is a big box?
Smiling and being pitted!
Looking closely, the heel chair of a friend on the left is Qi Ping, saying that the left side can't sit on the left .... Is this a Zhongda bag ...?Hehe, who really goes to who is unlucky ..."
我不知道是太久沒唱歌還是只有你們這樣，一間包廂只會免費提供一壺白開水，喝完要掏錢買礦泉水….我就問過濾水是有多貴？包廂電視還沒我家大，很扯,"I do n’t know if I have n’t sang for too long or only you. A box will only provide a pot of boiled water for free. After drinking, I need to pay for mineral water ... I ask how expensive the filter water is?The box TV is not as big as my house, very much"
謝謝服務人員給我很好的生日體驗，來了幾次點了不同的東西，也覺得都滿好吃的，廁所也很乾淨，願意再持續和朋友一起回訪：）,Thank you for the service staff to give me a good birthday experience. I came here a few different things. I also felt that they were all delicious. The toilet was very clean. I was willing to continue to visit with my friends again :)
餐點不錯吃 櫃台看起來像老闆的阿姨很好聊 週末一定會爆滿 記得提前預約 個人感覺餐點份量還可以 但偏鹹一定要配飯 兩個人週末凌晨去大概一人一千塊,The meal is good to eat the counter. It looks like the boss's aunt is very good to talk about the weekend. We weekend will be full. Remember to make an appointment in advance. I feel that the meal is available.
"已經來很多年了，這次居然給了超小的包廂(坐下要移動都要全部人一起移動的那種小），還要加錢才能再換，櫃檯金髮的小姐態度也很差。

換了一間機器之後，音響一直有超大噪音，地板整片超滑不知道是油還是什麼。

音響本身的音量已經開到最小，聲音還是爆到最大，男服務員也是誇張的差，一直說他沒聽到，態度非常差勁，問他什麼都說找櫃檯，那要你來上班幹嘛？

然後馬桶超爛根本沖不動，還要自己先通馬桶，跟女服務員反應，居然回說好啦！

除了服務費以外居然還要再收清潔費$200-$400不等，看包廂大小而定。

前前後後花了20分鐘，結果也沒扣掉照進去一開始的時間算。

整個差勁透頂，服務費跟清潔費也不知道哪來的臉皮好意思收。","It has come for many years. This time, I actually gave the super small box (the small of the small people who had to move together to move down), and I had to add money to change it. The lady of the counter of the counter was also very poor.

After changing a machine, the audio has always had a lot of noise. The entire floor is super slippery. I don't know if it is oil or what.

The volume of the audio itself has been minimized, and the sound is still exploded. The male waiter is also exaggerated. He always said that he did not hear it, and his attitude was very poor. Ask him to find a counter, so what do you want to come to work?

Then the toilet could not be rotten at all. He had to pass the toilet first and responded to the female waiter.

In addition to the service fee, the cleaning fee ranges from $ 200- $ 400, and it depends on the size of the box.

It took 20 minutes before and after, and the results did not deduct the time at the beginning.

The whole difference is penetrating, and the service fee and cleaning fee do not know where to get the face."
我以為灌水只有酒店有，原來這家買單前也一定要「仔細」看清楚單。沒看到就只能自求多福，總之這種店遲早會上新聞。,"I thought that there was only a hotel in irrigation. It turned out that this one must be ""careful"" before buying the bill.You can only ask for more blessings, in short, this kind of shop will be news sooner and later."
"歌曲多元很棒，服務也不錯，已二訪，但是吃的真的就沒另外兩家KTV龍頭好吃,對於一個吃貨來說很介意點了乾炒牛河，結果居然是炒板條….，真是驚喜…但以kTV而言很推呦！","歌曲多元很棒，服務也不錯，已二訪，但是吃的真的就沒另外兩家KTV龍頭好吃,對於一個吃貨來說很介意點了乾炒牛河，結果居然是炒板條….，真是驚喜…但以kTV而言很推呦！"
"超多日韓歌的啦讚讚👍
不過煙味小濃
但歌很新欸 浮誇了
但是是簡體字 …","A lot of Japanese and Korean songs, praise 👍
But smoke Xiaonong
But the song is very new 欸 exaggerated
But it is simplified characters ..."
"今天過去消費朋友們都很喜歡，英文歌很多他們超愛（也有一些動漫歌），除了我一開始等朋友的時候有人從我們包廂廁所走出來……傻眼以為是工作人員，不知道是哪裡的老頭喝醉了跑出來。
後來工作人員很有誠意的再幫我們打掃，至少他們開心我覺得圓滿了。","Today, consumer friends like it very much. Many of the English songs they love (there are also some anime songs). Except for me, when I was waiting for my friends, someone came out of our box toilet ... I thought it was a staff member, I do n’t know where it was The old man was drunk and ran out.
Later, the staff was sincere to help us clean up, at least they felt happy."
東西還不錯吃 如果帶外食清潔費價錢不固定 要先問清楚 開瓶費也是,"Good things are good. If you bring out food cleaning fees, you should first ask the bottle opening fee."
"起司條是冷的很奇怪
收費機制一開始沒有講清楚店員就看起來急急忙忙很緊張的把我們送到包廂內（像是服務費以及廁所清潔費等等基本費用沒有事先告知，可能是因為不常來所以也不知道有這些額外收費）
滷肉飯蠻好吃的可以點！
店員態度還算可以只是他們看起來很緊張也很急，可能是因為很忙但整體感覺讓人覺得有點壓抑
歌曲很多，特別是韓文歌特別多，但應該沒有版權
一個人唱四個小時花了大概900","The cheese is cold and strange
At the beginning, the charging mechanism did not make clear that the clerk seemed to hurry to send us to the box (such as service charges and toilet cleaning fees, etc., and did not inform them in advance. There are these additional charges)
The braised pork rice is delicious!
The attitude of the clerk can be just that they look very nervous and anxious, maybe because they are very busy but the overall feels a bit depressed
There are many songs, especially Korean songs, but there should be no copyright
It took about 900 to sing for four hours"
太貴了 設備食物都一般般 只能說去的都盤子,"It's too expensive, the food and food can only be said to go to the plate"
"之前已經去過多次，都覺得服務不錯。但唯獨這次的服務態度，讓我覺得蠻失望的。
因為服務生進來告知要結帳時，未在第一時間給我們看消費金額，甚至是我們主動拿過來看完收據上的消費金額以後，又馬上把收據收走。
讓我們無法確認我們實際上的消費金額是多少","I have been there many times before, and I feel that the service is good.But this service attitude makes me feel quite disappointed.
Because when the waiter came in to inform me, we did not show us the consumption amount in the first time, and even after we took the initiative to take it over to read the consumption amount in the receipt, we immediately took away the receipt.
Makes us unable to confirm how much our actual consumption amount is"
"幾乎每年過年都會來這邊
今年體驗非常非常非常糟糕
先是給一個超小包間
比去年小非常多
我們人數都沒變過

再來帶位的服務生態度非常差
詢問他能否換大間的可以加錢
一直說 你自己打電話
你自己打電話
換到一間大一點點的
結果有抽風噪音非常大聲
他說是剛開機
再來音控沒辦法使用
已經按到最小聲
音量還是大到要耳聾
換到第三間才正常
連本來那個抽風噪音都沒有

換到第三間音樂設施正常
結果廁所馬桶有問題

最後時間不到就結束了
前面換來換去的時間也算在內
而且根本還不滿四小時
根本坑人

已經來這裡很多年了
今年這樣真的很失望
不是要當奧客
只是需要一個舒服的唱歌空間而已
明年應該不會再來了","I come here almost every year in the New Year
This year's experience is very, very bad
First give a super small bag
A lot younger than last year
We have never changed

The service of the service again is very poor
Ask him if he can change the big room to add money
Always say you call yourself
You call yourself
Change to a bigger point
As a result, the noise was very loud
He said it was just boot
There is no way to use the sound control again
Has been pressed to the minimum sound
The volume is still so deaf
It is normal to change to the third room
Even the original noise is not available

It is normal for the third music facility to change to the third music facility
There is a problem with the toilet toilet

The last time is over, it is over
The time before the exchange is also included
And it's not full of four hours at all
Fundamental

I've been here for many years
It's really disappointed this year
Not to be an Austrian
Just need a comfortable singing space
It should not come again next year"
"1.續唱包廂計費一直以後面有客人當理由想趕人。
2.講道理服務生態度差到爆炸，看起來只想吵架，完全沒制度的ktv。","1. Continuing the box counting fee has always been a reason to be a reason to catch people.
2. True reasoning The ecosystem of service is so poor that the KTV that just wants to quarrel, there is no system at all."
"真的超爛 不會再去
廁所沖不了水 水壓極差
開著燈還有雜音 唱歌麥克風沒聲音
爛死了 爛中之爛
服務態度完全不行
去的人請三思
獲是根本不用去踩雷","It's really so bad that I won't go again
The toilet cannot be rushed to the water pressure poorly
There are no sounds on the lights and no sound of sound singing microphone
Rotten the rotten rotten
The attitude attitude is completely uncommon
People who go to think twice
You don't need to step on the mine at all"
老闆跟店員人都太好了…還有很多韓文日文歌,The boss and the clerk are great ... There are many Korean Japanese songs
"服務態度超級超級差 誰去誰倒楣 整天心情直接被毀滅！完完全全不會想再去一次 甚至是希望朋友都不要去被騙的店！有強迫消費飲食。

雖然價格不高 但是服務人員都很莫名其妙
完全沒有介紹 態度也都很隨便
我們渴的要死，走去櫃檯才發現是有附水的，我問櫃檯水是不是要錢，他說不用，要打電話叫他們送過去...從頭到尾沒告訴我們有這樣的服務，完全不知道= =
然後我說需要，他就看了我一眼繼續做自己的事，還要我站在旁邊自己問是不是可以自己拿回去...？？？？
(而且菜單上有賣水...以為是要付費)
然後第二次打電話請她給溫水 來到是一壺有冰塊的冰水(？？？)
只好再打電話請 給我們 熱水！
等了三十分鐘水還是沒來！只好再打電話，結果居然又來了一壺冰水！
只好直接跟服務生說，我們要溫水
，一直給我們冰水，服務生竟然跟我們說，抱歉 前臺只跟他說水@@

有很多抖音歌大陸歌 但是有很多伴奏音質都很爛 很像是下載下來自己把人聲拿掉 音樂都很炸

我們反應一開始消費沒說清楚 想問清楚 經理居然說是我們的問題 然後說我們是不是沒錢付 是以為我們窮所以找碴嗎？
學生就該活該被歧視？ 直接被經理氣到一句反饋都不想講了 直接錢付一付走人
經理居然還說給我們優待下次來打95折 誰還會想來這種把消費者氣的一肚子火的店？
強迫消費89塊的滷肉飯，不然你就只好點超過兩百塊的熱炒，或貴的要死的飲料！而且還會最後30分鐘前才跟你說要點餐喔！還叫你外帶！
真的不該貪圖距離方便！
下次還是去有名的大KTV比較好。","The service attitude is super super worse.I do n’t want to go to the shop that I do n’t want to be deceived!There are forced consumption diet.

Although the price is not high, the service staff are inexplicable
There is no introduction at all, and it is very casual
We thirsty to die, and we found that there was water at the counter. I asked if the counter water asked for money. He said no, he wanted to call them to send it over ... I don't know at all ==
Then I said need, he glanced at me and continued to do my own thing, and asked me to stand by and asked if I could take it back by myself ...?IntersectionIntersectionIntersection
(And there is water selling water on the menu ... I think it is to pay)
Then I called her for the second time and asked her to give warm water to a pot of ice water with ice cubes (???)
I had to call us hot water again!
Waiting for thirty minutes, the water still didn't come!I had to call again, but there was another pot of ice water!
I had to tell the waiter directly, we need warm water
, Always give us ice water, the waiter told us, sorry to tell him the water @@ @@

There are a lot of dazzling songs mainland songs, but many accompaniment sound quality is very bad, it is very like downloading and taking away the sound of the human sound.

At the beginning of our reaction, we didn't say clearly that the manager said that the manager said that it was our question. Then did we say that we had no money to pay, so we thought we were poor, so we looked for it?
Should students be discriminated against?I do n’t want to talk about the feedback by the manager, I do n’t want to talk about the money and pay for it.
The manager actually said that he would give us a 10 % discount next time who would want to come to such a shop that made consumers angry?
Forced consumption of 89 pieces of braised pork rice, otherwise you have to order more than two hundred hot stir -fry, or expensive drinks!And I will tell you to order for the last 30 minutes!Also call you for your take -off!
It should not be eager to be eager!
Next time, it is better to go to the famous big KTV."
"價格方面完全沒有誠實講
晚上12.點到
問價格說唱四小時一個人400多
然後一進去突然開始變成要額外低消150買食物
在櫃檯完全不講問價格的時候都不說
然後最後我們六個人4200多
一個人700多
莫名奇妙感覺還加了服務費
又一個沒講的地方
真的黑到不行
都已經是夜唱還這麼貴真的很過分","There is no honest talk in terms of price
12. Click to arrive
Ask the price rap of more than 400 people for four hours
Then I suddenly started to turn into an extra low 150 to buy food
I don’t say when I do n’t ask the price at all.
Then in the end, we have more than 4,200 people
More than 700 people
Inexplicable feelings also added service fees
Another place
It's really dark
It's already so expensive at night singing, it's really too much"
呵呵 真無語 明明只有一組客人 趕我們進包廂 說的中包 也沒說今天只有四個小時 進來就催促我們點酒 說點一箱送一手 我們就想說到七點可以點一箱來喝 結果突然就進來跟我們說剩一個小時 一個人盡然要到1000 我還不如去別家 反正下次不會來 謝了😊廁所清潔費加服務費 去搶吧🙂,"Hehe is really speechless, only one group of guests rushed to the boxes that we said that the bag said, and did not say that there were only four hours today, and it urged us to order a box and give a box for one hand. Suddenly I came in and told us that one hour left for one person to reach 1,000. I ’m better to go to others anyway."
東西好吃！服務態度100🥹 歌還很多可以挑,Things are delicious!Service attitude 100 很多 songs can be picked a lot
我唱歌到一半 服務生在沒跟我告知的狀況 給我按暫停鍵那邊講帳單 搞得他自己是老闆膩,I sing half of the waiter in the situation where the waiter notified to me and press the pause key to tell me that the bill is made by himself.
"價格有點貴,服務態度不佳，衛生也沒有很好：）","The price is a bit expensive, the service attitude is not good, and the hygiene is not very good :)"
"趁著剛開幕的低廉價格進去體驗(約$260/人/3hrs)，環境算明亮但包廂偏小，每個包廂似乎有不同的布置主題。員工服務態度良好，但因為人太多似乎有點忙不過來。歌曲的部分則是跟連鎖的不太相同，大陸歌偏多，國台語太冷門的可能找不到。
MV的部分則是包含了各種歌手翻唱、選秀節目等，連很古老的片都有，終於不用看外國人走來走去。點歌的軟體設計的很方便，掃描螢幕上的QR code就可以用手機點歌，控制音量、切歌、點歌一次搞定，甚至還能讓自己的留言顯示在螢幕上。特別的是歌與歌之間幾乎沒有廣告或其他MV插入，可以直接接著唱下一首，時間上也節省不少。
不知道開幕的優惠活動結束後價格是多少，若還是差不多的話可以考慮再訪，畢竟公館附近真的沒什麼唱歌的地點。

更新：價格與連鎖類似。","趁著剛開幕的低廉價格進去體驗(約$260/人/3hrs)，環境算明亮但包廂偏小，每個包廂似乎有不同的布置主題。員工服務態度良好，但因為人太多似乎有點忙不過來。歌曲的部分則是跟連鎖的不太相同，大陸歌偏多，國台語太冷門的可能找不到。

"環境很乾淨 服務很好 價格合理
短期間內已經來第二次了~
真的很推薦 包廂也超可愛👍🏼 …","The environment is very clean. Service is very good. The price is reasonable
It has come for a second time in the short term ~
I really recommend the box and cute 厢 ..."
價位其實也沒有特別便宜，員工都很年輕但會讓人有點怕怕的感覺，服務跟其他三大ktv無法比，點歌機應該是中國那邊的，很多簡體字跟抖音歌，是蠻特別的沒錯，但很多歌是擷取電影預告或是演唱會片段，有點誇張,"In fact, the price is not particularly cheap. Employees are very young, but they will feel a little scared. The service is incomparable with the other three major KTVs. That's right, but many songs are captured for movie trailers or concerts, which is a bit exaggerated"
可以唱到不少好樂迪跟錢櫃唱不到的歌，最讓我驚艷的是居然有乘風破浪的姐姐的歌，不過還想說一聲，這是間被炒飯耽誤的KTV，港式燒臘炒飯也太好吃了吧，而且炒的粒粒分明，不是重口味的調味卻非常非常好吃！大推炒飯！,可以唱到不少好樂迪跟錢櫃唱不到的歌，最讓我驚艷的是居然有乘風破浪的姐姐的歌，不過還想說一聲，這是間被炒飯耽誤的KTV，港式燒臘炒飯也太好吃了吧，而且炒的粒粒分明，不是重口味的調味卻非常非常好吃！大推炒飯！
"先說優點，餐點的部分可能我們剛好點到不雷的，都還不錯吃
歌曲的選擇性確實比其他家多很多
但缺點真的爛到無法用這些優點彌補

收費非常不透明，入場時也說明得不清不楚，小包廂自動升級中包廂需要多收費也沒告知，根本就是騙錢
到底憑什麼廁所清潔費要200元？我們沒喝酒沒開趴沒帶外食收什麼清潔費？
結帳時服務人員連載具是什麼都不知道會不會太誇張
音響設備姑且還行，但去人聲真的做得很爛，都選伴奏了還是能聽到清楚的原唱
真的是非常不愉快的消費經驗","Let's talk about the advantages first, the meal part may be just ordering, it is not bad to eat
The selectivity of the song is indeed much more than other families
But the disadvantages are really rotten enough to make up for these advantages

The charging is very opaque, and it is not clear when entering the market. The automatic upgrade in the small box requires more charges and did not notify it.
Why does the toilet clean cost cost 200 yuan?We did n’t drink, or did n’t we bring food to collect food?
The service staff does not even know if the service staff will be too exaggerated when the service staff will even be too exaggerated.
The audio equipment is okay, but the vocal voice is really bad. If you choose the accompaniment, you can still hear the clear original singing.
It's really unpleasant consumer experience"
超重的煙味會從別間飄過來廁所，起司條端上來是冷的，收費機制沒講清楚，四人4小時包廂費+低消+服務費直接從一人六百多變九百多，根本在搶錢，到底誰要花九百多唱四小時？,"The super -heavy smoke will float from the toilet from other other. The cheese bar is cold. The charging mechanism is not clear. The four -hour box fee+low consumption+service fee directly changed from more than 600 per person. At all, who is grabbing money, who will spend more than 900 singing for more than four hours?"

"一顆星給環境乾淨，音質畫質全部都像是盜版的感覺，與外面唱歌差不多的價位卻只有這樣的品質，覺得相當失落。
系統都是大陸的，使用起來不是那麼直覺，網路上的評價看來不能那麼相信。
唱到一半還被關房間，消費者被搞好玩的？","A star gives the environment clean, and the sound quality and quality of the sound are all like a pirated version. The price is about the same quality as it is singing outside. It feels quite lost.

"假日個人計價低消別人99它要150，加上服務費之後還要再額外收100元包廂清潔費，到底哪一家會收這筆？全部加起來一個人510最低，這樣的價錢比永和錢櫃同時段還要貴，我幹嘛來這裡當盤子？問老闆娘一個人最低總共多少只會跳針計費方式就是不肯說510，然後說規定貼在旁邊不會自己看？我就現場給你算出來才不甘願的點頭，多怕被人知道妳家比錢櫃還盤？這家真的沒有比較便宜！
消費時間剛到才過五分鐘，沒錯就是五分鐘，我們才在上廁所收東西準備出去，服務生就敲門進來喊時間已經超過五分鐘了！！！到底哪一家KTV點歌機時間剛到五分鐘就會進來催人的？！真的超級無敵霹靂雷！勸退勸退！","Personal prices of holidays are low. 99. It costs 150. After the service fee, it has to charge an additional 100 yuan box cleaning fee. Which one will charge this?It is the lowest to add up to 510. Such a price is more expensive than Yong and the cash counter at the same time. Why do I come here as a plate?Ask the boss and lady, how much can a total of only a total of only the need to jump the needle and not say 510, and then say that it will be posted on the side and won't look at it by himself?I just nodded out of the scene, so I was afraid that people knew that your family was more than a cash cabinet?This house is really cheap!
It took only five minutes for the consumption time. Yes, it was five minutes. We were ready to go to the toilet to get out of the west. The waiter knocked in the door and shouted for more than five minutes!IntersectionIntersectionWhich KTV song machine time will come in just five minutes?IntersectionReally super invincible Perak!Densation and persuasion!"
4個小時唱到一半系統就當掉，修復了半個小時以上還沒好，一開始只願意在加時，但影響到後面的行程，溝通後只願意給八折，實在不值得推薦，要來的人請自行斟酌，整個唱歌的興致都沒了🙃,"It ’s not good for 4 hours to sing and half the system. It’ s not good after repairing it for more than half an hour. At first, I was only willing to increase the time, but it affected the subsequent itinerary. I was willing to give me 20 % off after communication. Those who come, please consider yourself, the interest of the whole singing is gone 🙃"
有一段時間沒去唱歌了，今天一去櫃檯立馬就說我們有一段時間沒去了，真厲害，今天點了熱炒吃不如預期的好吃，太鹹了也油，因為要先走所以就在櫃檯跟他們聊了一下，說會改進，服務生太可愛了，高大的男生給你一個大大的讚⋯⋯希望下次在去他們的熱炒有真的改好吃一點，,"I haven't sang for a while. Today, I immediately said that we hadn't gone for a while. It's really good. Today, I ordered hot frying to eat. It ’s not as delicious as expected. It’ s too salty. I talked to them at the counter and said that they would be improved. The waiter is too cute. The tall boys will give you a big praise. I hope that the next time I will go to their hot frying."
新開幕，難得公館也開了間KTV，每間都有不一樣的主題，加上每間都有獨立的廁所，也太棒了～,"The new opening, rare managers also opened KTV. Each room has different themes. In addition, each side has an independent toilet, which is great ~"
"預定的時間到達後，櫃檯告訴我們在清包廂了，等了一陣子之後，想說去樓下等。等了十幾分鐘後上樓後還是告知在清包廂，最後總共的了半個多鐘頭。
如果真的沒有包廂的話真的可以不用接沒關係，一行人浪費不少時間在等待，另外點唱介面非常難用，搜尋也搜不到，要找歌手還找不到。","After the scheduled time arrived, the counter told us that we were in the box. After waiting for a while, I wanted to go downstairs and wait.After waiting for ten minutes, I still told the box after going upstairs. In the end, it took more than half an hour.

"過年期間去下午時段不會很貴初一
還算ok的價錢，美中不足的就是硬體設備的問題，點了他們的熱炒跟炒飯，熱炒還可以就是太鹹了油了一點，還有炒飯像在吃鍋巴一樣，反應了服務生，馬上就幫我們從新作了一份，櫃檯還很不錯，送小菜兩份，服務生態度很好，下次家庭聚餐我們會在去獅子王，","During the New Year, it will not be expensive in the afternoon

"說在前頭：我平常是獅子王的忠實顧客，但這次事件太過誇張，請各位網友詳閱完後審慎考慮是否還要來這種店家消費。
昨天我是訂18:00 3位，到了之後店員跟我們說包廂裡還有人要稍等，我們等了20分鐘，店員又跟我們說「裡面還有人，不然要不要換迷你包（我們原本應該是小包）」
我問店員這樣消費金額還是一樣嗎，他跟我說還是一樣。
首先，我有訂位，你也確認了 ，那我在這個時間出現，無論如何，我們不是本來就要有包廂嗎？
再來，時間到不是就該出來嗎？為什麼拖了20分鐘還不出來？但店員只回我「客人時間到，你不可能馬上趕他們出來」
老哥，今天開店做生意的是你不是我欸，難道要我走進去跟他們說「不好意思，換我們唱了喔」店家給人的感覺就是一副我客人很多，你們不要唱的話後面會有人補。
做生意不是這樣吧？
後來我們時間到，最後一首歌才唱到副歌，店員就進來趕我們兩次，那前面等了20分鐘說不能趕人是？？？
猜測那時候他們根本就是先把訂位的包廂給別人用，然後沒有包廂了吧？如此沒有「誠信」的店家，在事發後又一副「不爽別唱」的姿態，請各位踏入前三思！
最後，個人覺得他們的歌單跟以前相比更新的有點慢，然後原本餐點「松露蝦仁蛋炒飯」硬生生變成「蝦仁蛋炒飯」，以為沒人發現，但老哥很抱歉鐵粉在這裡，之後也不會再去了。","Speaking of the front: I am usually a loyal customer of the Lion King, but this time is too exaggerated. Please consider whether you have to come to this kind of shop consumption after you read it carefully.
Yesterday, I booked 18:00, and then the clerk told us that there were still people waiting in the box. We waited for 20 minutes. It's a small bag) ""
I asked the clerk if the amount of consumption was still the same, he told me the same.
First of all, I have a reservation, and you confirmed that at this time, do you have to have a box in any case?
Come again, shouldn't time come out?Why didn't you come out for 20 minutes?But the clerk only returns to me, ""The guest time is here, you can't catch them out immediately""
Brother, you are not me. I ’m not me. Do you want me to go in and say,“ Sorry, we sings for us. ”The shop feels like a lot of my guests. Someone make up.
Isn't it like this?
Later, we arrived, and the last song sang to the chorus. The clerk came in to rush us twice. Then wait for 20 minutes to say that you can't catch people?IntersectionIntersection
Guess that at that time they simply used the box to be used for others, and then there was no box?Such a ""integrity"" shop, another ""unhappy"" attitude after the incident, please think twice!
Finally, I personally think that their song list is a bit slower than before, and then the original meal ""truffle shrimp egg fried rice"" became ""shrimp egg fried rice"", thinking no one found it, but the brother was sorry for the iron powder was in Here, I won't go again."

"獅子王KTV 跟朋友一起來，服務生很好，服務不錯，推菜進來看起來不錯結果，熱炒不如預期的好吃，我朋友說之前來都很好吃.結果不是很鹹就是油，味道跟之前的差太多了，第一次來，三杯中捲很難吃花生龍珠也很油，大家都說跟之前的差很多
下次再來唱歌，不會在點熱炒了，還是吃飽在來，真的跟網路說的一樣熱炒很鹹很油，炒飯很硬，怎麼吃
希望店家多改進，想跟櫃台反應一下，結果他們櫃台是個男生，問了一下服務生說副理休假，下次在來一定要他們副理送東西，","The lion king KTV is coming with friends, the waiter is very good, the service is good, the push vegetables come in, it looks good, it is not as delicious as expected. My friend said that it was delicious before. The result was not very salty or oil, the taste, the taste It is too much different from the previous. For the first time, it is difficult to eat peanut Dragon Ball in the three cups. Everyone said that it is much different from the previous.
Sing again next time, I won't be frying at some heat, or I still have to eat. It is really as hot as the Internet.
I hope that the store will improve more and want to respond to the counter. As a result, they are a boy at the counter. I asked the waiter to say that the deputy manager was on vacation."
"以前去體驗就是便宜但還可以，這次去氣爛。
打電話預約到時候只說一個人費用跟低消，到現場突然說要多收100塊廁所清潔費還刻意說超小聲。
廁所清潔費是什麼鬼？
好了結果結帳的時候又發現除了廁所清潔費又多收了一成服務費？
然後服務都打掃阿姨在服務，請問你們連服務人員都沒有是在收什麼一成？
還有第一次看過來換麥克風電池是人進來在裡面換的，不怕客人覺得尷尬？
服務爛成這樣給我多收一成？
拜託不要再來，這種爛地方讓他被市場淘汰掉！","I used to experience it cheap but okay, this time it was rotten.
At that time, I only said that one person cost and low, and suddenly said that the cleaning fee of 100 toilets was required to be overwhelmed.
What is the ghost of the toilet cleaning fee?
When the results were at the checkout, I found that the service fee was charged in addition to the cleaning fee of the toilet?
Then the service was cleaned up in the service. May I ask you not even collecting any service staff?
And for the first time, when I saw it to change the microphone battery, people came in and changed. Are you afraid that the guests would be embarrassed?
The service rotes to me by 10 %?
Please don't come again, this rotten place allows him to be eliminated by the market!"
看來之前的負評並沒有讓店家改善，服務態度爛到靠北，從一開始進場到櫃檯時，櫃檯人員解釋消費也沒說清楚就算了，然後說有帶外食要內用的話要再加收100元包廂清潔費，荒唐至極！有收廁所清潔費就算了，廁所門也是壞的，而且跟服務生要水時竟然得到要點飲料才會給，都有低消了給杯水很難嗎？再來唱歌時一直聞到煙味，空調設備也爛，最後結帳時跟服務生說買到整點，結完帳明明就還有30分鐘，直接把點歌系統關掉，也沒啥客人還要凹時間趕客人走XD，不知道那個服務生是不是老闆的兒子，服務態度差又甩門，實在讓人唱歌的心情都沒有了很不爽，還有櫃檯的小姐也是臉臭又翻白眼，服務態度實在讓人不敢恭維，可以的話希望老闆把他們換掉，不然請大家用行為去抵制他們不要去那邊消費讓他們關店，花錢買罪受不如在自己家唱就好了，幹嘛去那邊！,"It seems that the previous negative reviews did not improve the store, and the service attitude was rotten to the north. From the beginning to the counter to the counter, the counter staff explained that the consumption did not make it clear. Add 100 yuan box cleaning fee, absurdity!Even if there is a cleaning fee for the toilet, the toilet door is also bad, and it will only get a point drink when asking the waiter to get water. Is it difficult to get a low cup of water?I always smell the smoke when I sing, and the air conditioning equipment is rotten. When I finally checked the checkout, I told the waiter to buy the whole point. There was still 30 minutes after the end of the account. I need to catch the guests to go XD. I do n’t know if the waiter is the son of the boss. The service attitude is poor and dumped. It is really uncomfortable to sing. The attitude really makes people dare not compliment. If possible, I hope the boss will replace them. Well, go there!"
唱歌要先學數學公式，價格還會被加上各種明目，整體花費高於錢X，相比其他ktv同樣價位，空間小、電視也小，還灌了各種簡體字的版本，而且店員態度也很差，店家自己搞出複雜的價格計算，訊問價位還很不耐煩⋯時間一到5分鐘內就來趕人，收拾上廁所都來不及，明明外面沒人排隊一堆空包廂，有必要這樣嗎⋯⋯,"Singing must first learn the mathematical formula, the price will also be added with various eyes, the overall cost is higher than the money X. Compared with other KTVs, the same price, the space is small, the TV is also small, and various simplified characters are also poured, and the clerk is also the clerk. The attitude is also very poor. The store itself has calculated the complicated price calculation. The question price is still impatient. Come to catch people within one to 5 minutes, and it is too late to clean up the toilet. Is this ..."
兩人入場收三人費用，急收錢，態度不佳，時間到直接切歌，急趕人，服務員像站衛兵，歌詞跟音樂不同步，煙味重。,"The two entered the venue to collect three people, urgent money, and poor attitude. The time was to cut the song directly."

店員態度好 環境佳 價格便宜,"The clerk's attitude is good, the environment is good, the price is cheap"
"不知道你們給五顆星的人有沒有摸著良心

先論態度，除了櫃台有一位年紀稍長的服務生(戴眼鏡的男生)服務態度算好，其他態度都很消極，尤其是一個女的綁馬尾，看名牌好像是經理還是副理的態度特別差(沒有要要求畢恭畢敬還是怎樣，但連基本的服務話術都沒有，好像欠妳錢似的)，帶個食物進去或問問題就一臉看人沒有的臉，說話也很不屑，關上我們的門還翻白眼。

唱歌設備就不多說了，其他評論都有寫到。

餐點一定要說，那個低消真的很不理解，但就算了畢竟唱歌還是要吃飯，但滷味真的真的真的很難吃，建議大家不要點，連豬血糕這種加工食品都可以煮的難吃真的很厲害，還有飲料算是甜到瞎掉啦

越想越生氣，已經跟周遭所有親友都說了，不要來這邊消費，會受一肚子氣，空間也小到不行。","I don’t know if you give the five stars if you have a conscience

On the first discussion, except for the counter at the counter (a boy wearing glasses), the service attitude is good, and other attitudes are negative, especially a woman ties the ponytail. Poor (there is no request to be respectful or what, but not even the basic service words, as if you owe you), take a food in or ask questions, look at the face without people, and the words are disdainful. Close us to us. The door of the door also rolled his eyes.

There are not much to say singing equipment, and other comments are written.

The meal must be said that that low consumption is really not understood, but even after all, singing still has to eat, but Jiewei is really really difficult to eat. It is recommended that you do n’t want to order it. It is really amazing that it can be cooked, and the drink is sweet enough to be blind.

12/1晚上六點半要訂位結果接電話的客服人員講話口氣不知道在差什麼，問個方案跟他怎麼稱呼都死不講，欠投訴，原本要去獅子王後來因為態度太差改去景美好樂迪了，金額服務費都一樣而且講電話的客服態度還比較好，哎，貴公司真的該換個接電話的人，不然想預約的人聽到這種口氣都不想去了⋯,"At 6:30 pm, the customer service staff who answered the phone in the evening did not know what was bad. Ask a plan to say what he told him, owe complaints, originally going to the lion king because of his poor attitude changed too much change to change. Going to Jingmei Loidi, the amount of service fees is the same and the customer service attitude of the phone is better. Hey, your company should really change the phone person, otherwise the person who wants to make an appointment doesn’t want to go."
"我們早早就打電話訂好晚上十點的大包廂，結果當天晚上八點才打電話來說大包廂需要訂金，因為是學生所以不和我們收，現在大包廂被別人訂走了，所以要我們改到晚上十點五十唱。這整個服務流程就很奇怪，既然都說不和我們收訂金了，那憑甚麼我們就該被別人插隊？那一開始就和我們說要收訂金就好了不是嗎？造成我們一大群人的行程大亂。

好，延後我們就認了，結果到現場時又和我們說店員還沒有登記到，要我們現場等。不對啊，說要改時間也是你們，說沒登記到的也是你們，怎麼會因為我們是學生就給我們這種服務？於是多等了十五分鐘幫我們整理一個包廂，整理完之後卻給我們小包廂，我們總共有十四個人，怎麼會是給我們小包廂？又和我們說要等到晚上十二點才給我們大包廂，這真的超奇怪，問題那麼多，為什麼不在門口的時候就講清楚說要等到什麼時候，那至少我們可以先去別的地方逛，小包廂根本坐不下那麼多人啊。

我真的想問問你們是怎麼幫所有客人排程的，這個不對，那個也不對，櫃台談論的態度也很糟，顧客滿意度直線下降，多送幾個小時讓我們唱到天亮根本是於事無補，CRM 搞得那麼差，還請管理階層多多檢討。另外，設備真的是有待加強，唱過不少 KTV，沒遇過有人唱到一半機器需要重新開機的，而且還重開了兩三次，裡頭的音樂歌詞一堆都是簡體中文，支支嗚嗚的這到底是怎麼做生意的？難道是盜版音樂嗎？","We called early to order the large box at 10 o'clock in the evening. As a result, it was only 8 o'clock that day to call to say that the big box needed a deposit because it was a student. Change to 10.50 pm.The entire service process is strange. Since we say that we do not collect the deposit with us, why should we be intervened by others?At the beginning, I told us that it would be better to collect the deposit?Causes the schedule of a large group of people.

Okay, we recognized it after being postponed. As a result, we told us that the clerk had not registered, and asked us to live.No, it is you who say that you want to change your time, and it ’s also you who said it’ s not registered. How can you give us this kind of service because we are a student?So I waited for fifteen minutes to help us organize a box, but after finishing, we gave us a small box. We have a total of fourteen people. How can we give us a small box?I told us that it will not be given to us the big box until 12 pm. This is really strange. There are so many problems. Why do you tell me clearly when you are not at the door? At least we can go to other places first The small box can't sit so many people at all.

I really want to ask you how you can help all guests. This is wrong. That is wrong. The attitude of the counter at the counter is also very bad. Customer satisfaction drops directly. It is a few hours to send us to sing to dawn. There is no complementary thing, CRM is so bad, please ask the management to review more.In addition, the equipment really needs to be strengthened. A lot of KTV has been sang. I have never encountered that someone sang half of the machine and needed to be re -turned on, and it was reopened two or three times. The music lyrics in it were all simplified Chinese. How do this do business?Is it pirated music?"
"這裡算是跟其他常見的KTV比稍微便宜的，適合學生朋友聚會的地方，不過有些地方真的有待加強🙏🏻希望你們看到可以加強訓練（不管是員工還是主管），相信你們已經生意興隆，但未來會更好的，雖然來這邊體驗沒有很多次3次而已，但是每次都有些不太好的體驗，當然我都還能接受才會三訪，因為都是講話口氣的問題，讓人覺得有點莫名🥹

一開始就是一般講話口氣，沒特別有禮貌也沒有到讓人不能接受
後來說到收費，其實在電話訂位時服務人員就有跟我說收費標準，而我也都知道理解了，結果在現場那位女生卻突然說有包廂費，我當時聽到並未馬上反應過來，只想說為什麼包廂費跟人頭費都要算，問了他是否多算包廂費的問題，他回我 你這樣聽不懂？（一個不太好的態度嘴臉），希望未來可以說明清楚包廂費與人頭費，當然假日要上班真的很辛苦我知道，但我就是不理解才會詢問啊，應該沒有必要擺出一副客人應該什麼都要知道必須懂的樣子吧？如果客人都懂就不需要服務人員了🥹 加油吧！","This is considered to be slightly cheaper than other common KTVs, where it is suitable for students and friends to meet, but some places really need to be strengthened. I hope you can strengthen training (whether it is employee or supervisor). In the future, it will be better.

From the beginning, it was a general tone.
Later, when it comes to charging, in fact, when the phone booking, the service staff told me the charge standard, and I also knew that the girl at the scene suddenly said that there was a box fee. At that time, I heard that I did not respond immediately Come here, I just want to say why the box fee and head fee must be calculated. Ask him if he calculates the question of more box fees, he can't understand if he returns to me?(A bad attitude), I hope that the box fee and head fee can be explained in the future. Of course, it is really hard to go to work on holiday. I just know it. Should I know everything?If the guests understand, they don't need to be a service personnel. Come on!"
"第一次去唱被消費金額嚇到！
假日中午時段價格居然比各大家連鎖KTV還貴，通常網站上公告的金額都是包含低消，但是獅子王的低消居然是另外算，而且低消還是一人$150（也比其他家KTV都高），當天因為是中午12.進去，所以我帶了一份早午餐，在門口被告知不能帶外食，帶外食要收清潔費$200，其實蠻錯愕，因為其他家KTV都可以帶，另外櫃檯告知可以帶飲料不能帶食物，但是飲料喝完垃圾要自己帶走？！

另外一點更不合理的是要收廁所清潔費$100，垃圾要自己帶走、廁所清潔費要另外收，那到底我的服務費是付在什麼項目上？？付在工作人員端進來我們低消點的餐點嗎？

雖然是自願進去消費，但是不會再去第二次，因為整體的CP值會選擇其他連鎖KTV","The first time to sing was scared by the amount of consumption!
During noon noon, the price is actually more expensive than everyone chain KTV. Usually the amount announced on the website contains low consumption, but the low consumption of the lion king is actually counted. ), Because it was noon that day, I went in, so I brought a brunch and was told that I could not bring food at the door. I had to collect the cleaning fee of $ 200 with food. Can you bring drinks and not to bring food, but you should take away the garbage after drinking the drink?Intersection

Another point is that the cleaning fee of the toilet is $ 100, the garbage must be taken away, and the toilet cleaning fee must be charged separately. So what kind of project does my service fee pay?IntersectionDo you come in our low -point meal in the staff?

Top pricing is offset and the service fee is normal
But the toilet should be added to 200/box
There are toilets in all boxes, no boxes, no toilets
If you want ice cubes, you must order wine
The bottle fees are required, the cost of the box is the size of the box, and the extra charges should be charged. The larger the box, the more the box, but the name of 7 people named Zhongda Boxes will be side by side.

"帶黑框眼鏡的服務員開門撞到人不會道歉只急著收錢，沒有吃外食也要收300元的外食清潔費。

雖然已經不是第一次去這家，但他真的永遠只會放在plan b，其他家沒位子才來的選擇。九個人給我們開大概1.5坪的包廂，還要自己去跟服務員拿小圓椅子。

重點是沒有吃外食也要跟你收費，前面在講解收費標準時也沒有提到這個費用⋯⋯服務員態度還很跩的說就是要收。開門撞到人沒在道歉開口就說收錢，到底是怎麼訓練的讓你可以開門時不用敲門或是先輕輕開門看一下啊？ 超沒禮貌跟素質吧^_^","The waiter with black -frame glasses opens the door and hit someone and does not apologize. He just rushed to collect money, and he had to charge 300 yuan for food cleaning fees without eating food.

Although it is not the first time to go to this house, he will always only be placed in PLAN B, and other families have no choice.Nine people open a box of about 1.5 pings to us, and go to take a small round chair with the waiter.

The point is that you have to charge you without eating food. I did not mention this fee when explaining the charging standard.When you open the door, you do n’t have to collect money when you do n’t apologize. How can you train you without knocking on the door or gently opening the door when you open the door?Super rudeness and quality, right?^_^"
"1.一週前預約六人，今天到場時只來了五人，但仍須收取六人份費用，唱歌十幾年第一次遇到這樣的收費方式。

2.包廂很小，且設備非常差，音質不佳就算了，還經常出現高頻尖銳的干擾聲，我們五個人唱完後不約而同地拿起手機，預約明天的耳鼻喉科。

3.時間一到系統直接切歌，也是第一次遇到不讓人把最後一首歌唱完的店。

早在預約之前，我們就發現貴店近期的評論不佳，起初並不相信真有這麼差，但實際體驗後，我只能用「目瞪口呆，嘆為觀止」八個字來形容，原來大部份的負評居然都是真的！？我在瞠目結舌之餘，特別準備了一顆美麗的星星送給貴店作為勉勵，希望貴店好好思考如何精進客戶的消費體驗。","1. Booking six people a week ago, only five people came when they arrived today, but they still needed to charge six people. Singing for the first time in a dozen years, they encountered such a fee method.

2. The box is very small, the equipment is very poor, and the sound quality is not good. There are often high -frequency sharp interference sounds. After the five of us sing, we pick up the mobile phone after singing and make an appointment for tomorrow's otolaryngology.

3. The time to cut the song as soon as possible, it is also the first time that I have encountered a shop that does not let people sing the last song.

Before the appointment, we found that Guidian's recent comments were not good. At first, I didn't believe it was so bad, but after the actual experience, I could only describe it in the eight words ""stunned, sighing"". The reviews are all true!IntersectionI was dazzling, and I specially prepared a beautiful star to give Guidian as an encouragement. I hope your store will think about how to refine the customer's consumption experience."
環境不錯服務態度也不錯～歌和星聚點錢櫃不太一樣，大陸的歌很多，音質沒有像星聚點錢櫃那麼好，但還不錯了！,"The environment is good. The attitude is also good. The song is not the same as the star gathers. There are many songs in the mainland. The sound quality is not as good as the Xingju money cabinet, but it is not bad!"
價格便宜 品項齊全 東西也好吃,The price is cheap and the whole thing is delicious.
請問貴公司是毒窟嗎？已經來好幾次了都是滿滿的k仔味，昨天晚上大約2.30左右坐A03包廂不斷的聞到k仔味的味道，也跟服務生說了2-3次了但貴公司的員工卻不為所動,"Is your company a poison cave?It has been here several times, and it is full of K Zai flavor. Last night, about 2.30 in about 2.30 in the A03 box continued to smell the taste of K Ziwei. He also told the waiter for 2-3 times, but the employees of your company didn’t. Move"
爛！下午的櫃檯阿姨態度超差，自己音響出問題，換間包廂還直接少一隻麥，一開始沒打算補償就算了，我們禮貌詢問能不能多給一隻手麥或再換個包廂，回應語氣有夠衝還語帶歧視，不知道在跩幾點，最後說要食物可以給我們，把我們當乞丐一樣，唱歌心情直接沒了，想來的人請三思，現在不僅價錢變貴，還會讓你一肚子火,"rotten!The aunt at the counter in the afternoon was too poor, and there was a problem with the sound of my own sound. I still had one less wheat in the room. I did n’t plan to compensate at first. It's enough to discriminate against the words. I don't know what time is it. Finally, I said that food can be given to us. I can give us as a beggar. The singing mood is gone. Please think twice. A stomach fire"
事先訂位且準時到場，還跟我們說包廂沒有，自動升級包廂在多收費，人數4人還要算成5人費用，超派,"Booking in advance and attending the scene on time, I also told us that there are no boxes. The automatic upgrade box is charged for more. The number of 4 people will be counted as a fee of 5 people."

"服務態度超差，門口一個男的 感覺是主管？接電話講話態度有夠差，到現場那個嘴臉真的讓人無法接受，記得之前是一位女生很親切態度很好的啊😭

說真的會願意去都只是印象中超便宜，沒什麼其他優點：）
不要因為近就去 真的極有可能心情差爆唱不下去 …","The attitude attitude attitude is very poor. Is a man at the door feel the supervisor?The attitude of receiving the phone was bad enough. The face at the scene was really unacceptable. I remember that a girl was very kind and good.
The point is that the price is getting more and more expensive, which is more expensive than the KTVs of many branches. It is not more than 600 in the early morning in the evening ... The box is super small. What is the largest box can only be five people limit at all.

剛進來櫃檯就態度很差的跟我們確認包廂訂8位，確定有8個人吼？
一副沒有8個人好像會被懲罰一樣？

後來點5道熱炒，他送錯一道，跟服務員反應後說要收回去，再補送我們正確的餐點，第一次遇到會回收餐點的

被說VIP包廂都要付訂金，已經額滿（忍耐）
那幫我安排大包預定可以嗎？
服務人員說：要等到凌晨3-4點，你們還要嗎

唱歌過程一直進來點人頭，一個小時後一直進來問要不要續唱（最少有10次）開包廂時，我們已經告知「一定會續唱」

最後生氣，跟服務人員說：不要再給我亂開包廂門了，我們沒有按服務鈴，都不要進來
硬體跟軟體，是我有史以來，遇過最差的","Thunderbolt ~ I book 10 people (Zhongda Box)
As soon as I entered the box dumbfounded, it looked smaller than the middle bag of Qian X. We asked if we could change the big bag.
It is said that the VIP box has to pay a deposit, and it is already full (endurance)
Is it okay to arrange a big bag for me?
The service staff said: Wait until 3-4 am, do you want it?

The singing process has always come in. After an hour, I came in and asked if I want to sing (at least 10 times) to open the box, we have informed that ""will definitely sing""

Finally, I was angry and told the service staff: Don't open the chart door for me anymore.
Hardware and software are the worst in my history."
櫃檯很細心，講解的很清楚，價格公道，餐點好吃值得大家帶家人或朋友去唱歌,"The counter is very careful, explained very clearly, the price is fair, the meals are delicious, it is worth taking family or friends to sing"
"不知道前陣子那次整修了什麼東西，可以把服務整到爛掉。我決定把這次的鳥蛋經歷寫成文字，以免出現更多的受害者。以下文長，沒時間看的話建議直接拉到最後一段。

以前來這邊唱歌和服務生要熱開水都會給，今天跟我說，要點一壺（貴到x北的）飲料才會給水？？？而且還只有冷開水？？？這輩子還沒在台北看過不提供開水的KTV，今天算是讓我長見識了。

再來，歌曲音質也是參差不齊，不知道他們歌的問題還是音響設備在搞，就是有些歌曲聽起來特別刺耳，尤其是日文歌，那刺耳的程度大概是中文歌的100倍，在這裡妄想點日文歌的我大概是有病。不過往好的方向思考，如果想體驗耳膜被刺破的感覺，獅子王KTV有提供全台最棒的服務。

最後，如果大家有去過比較大間的連鎖KTV（星x點、x櫃）等等，應該都會知道即使最後一首歌已經超過時間了，還是會讓你唱完完整一首歌。過去的獅子王也是這樣沒錯，但現在是時間到了直接把你的歌咖掉，我想，唱到一半被咖歌這種美送的感覺應該不用再多做說明了。歌直接咖掉我就跟你算了，時間才剛結束，3分鐘內來趕人2次是什麼意思？？？啊唱完歌不用稍微收一下包包喔？？？到底是多急著趕人？？？？？

總而言之，這邊價格看似很便宜，不過設備不太行、餐點夭壽貴且禁帶外食，跟你收10%服務費然後提供一坨x給你。想要來這邊消費的話，建議三思。","I do n’t know what the renovation of that time ago can make the service rot.I decided to write this bird egg experience into text to avoid more victims.The following article is long. If you do n’t have time to read it, it is recommended to pull it directly to the last paragraph.

I used to sing here and the waiter will give it hot water. Today I told me that if you order a pot (expensive to X North), you will give water?IntersectionIntersectionAnd only cold water?IntersectionIntersectionI have n’t seen KTV who did n’t provide boiling water in Taipei in my life. Today I have made me a lot of knowledge.

Then, the sound quality of the song is also uneven. I do n’t know that the problem of their songs is that the audio equipment is doing, that is, some songs sound particularly harsh, especially Japanese songs. The harsh level is about 100 times the Chinese song. I am probably sick in Japanese songs.However, thinking in a good direction, if you want to experience the feeling of being pierced by the eardrum, the Lion King KTV has the best service in Taiwan.

In the end, if you have been to a larger chain KTV (Star X, X Cabinet), etc., you should know that even if the last song is over time, it will still make you sing a complete song.This is also true of the lion king in the past, but now it is time to go directly to your song coffee directly. I think that it is not necessary to explain more about the feeling of being given by half of the beauty song.I calculate the song directly with you. What does it mean that time is just over. What does it mean to catch people 2 times in 3 minutes?IntersectionIntersectionAh, do n’t you need to collect the bag after singing?IntersectionIntersectionHow are you anxious to catch people?IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection

All in all, the price here seems very cheap, but the equipment is not very good, the meals are expensive, and the food is banned. You can charge you 10%of the service fee and then provide you with an X for you.If you want to come here to consume, think twice."

"前兩天就訂位晚上10點了，結果當天說VIP包廂要訂金，因為我們是學生所以沒跟我們說要訂金，VIP包被訂走了

當天店員將我們時間更改為10點50，結果店員還沒有登記，過去直接不能唱，後來開包廂結果是小包廂，14人擠小包廂要不要想清楚你們怎麼安排的？

之後才討論能夠在12點換成大包廂，結果大包廂服務鈴一直壞，中間進來重開好幾次，超爛，沒有交接好搞到我們還沒有任何賠償，態度還超差

還有飲料燙還給金屬杯，根本是純粹來搞人的吧","Two days ago, the booking was 10 o'clock in the evening. As a result, it was said that the VIP box had to be deposited. Because we were a student, I did n’t tell us that I had to make a deposit. The VIP package was ordered

On the same day, the clerk changed our time to 10:50. As a result, the clerk had not registered. In the past, he could not sing. Later, the box was opened. The result was a small box. Should 14 people squeeze the small box? Do n’t think about how you arrange it?

After that, I discussed that it could be replaced with a large box at 12 o'clock. As a result, the big box service bell has been bad, and it has been opened several times in the middle. It is super rotten.

There are also drinks to the metal cup."
之前第一次來唱歌，環境氣氛都很棒，而且熱炒餐點超級好吃，手藝甚至比外面熱炒還好，如果可以我真的很想叫外賣。,之前第一次來唱歌，環境氣氛都很棒，而且熱炒餐點超級好吃，手藝甚至比外面熱炒還好，如果可以我真的很想叫外賣。

"打電話訂位卻讓客人在比預定時間更晚一點到，如此要求就算了，到店後更等了近30分鐘。店員最後甚至搞不清楚狀況逕自將包廂轉給他人，理由竟是自我的以消費者的角度預測我們沒有要唱。認為用補償一人一杯奶茶、還有下次來消費招待點心的名片就能夠彌補浪費消費者時間的心態真的不可取，完全不推🙂
噢對了 他們的服務直6顆星 只是其他5顆被良心吃掉了 …","Calling a place makes guests a little later than the scheduled time. Even if the requirements are, they have waited for nearly 30 minutes after arriving at the store.In the end, the clerk couldn't even know that the situation was transferred to others.

"店內低消89元，適當人數的話，包廂三小時每個人均分大概價位落在六百左右，不算太貴但也不算便宜。
走樓梯到二樓就能到是蠻方便的，但內部的設施有點老舊，廁所門要抬起來才能關上。
裡面歌曲還蠻齊全的，部分英日文比較有名的曲子也有。","The store is 89 yuan low. If the appropriate number is appropriate, the price of the box for three hours is about 600, which is not too expensive but not cheap.

一進去包廂服務員人就直接走了 都沒有告訴我們機器的操作 然後（罐裝可樂）就要50 便利商店才20淨賺30？唱到一半服務員沒有敲門就突然進來 機器的歌不全 很多歌都沒有,"As soon as the waiter in the box entered, he left without telling us the operation of the machine.

黑店 明明有比較划算的計價還要先用最貴的算！平日晚上唱2小時3個人要算2700笑死 這種設備、服務態度那麼爛！尤其是一位長髮阿姨，根本想先薛一波 ，被發現亂計價才改回比較優惠的方案，一開始就應該要想到的 …爛到不可思議！,"Black shops are obviously more cost -effective to use the most expensive calculations first!Singing for 2 hours on weekdays, 3 people have to count 2700 laughing and death. This equipment and service attitude are so bad!Especially a long -haired aunt, who wanted to first want to be a preferential plan when he was found to be found to be discovered. He should think of it from the beginning ... it is incredible!"
去過三四次，低消漲價到150，我覺得不符合獅子王的定位了；最令我心酸的是唱最後一首情歌王被催兩次時間到了。,"I have been to three or four times, and the low price increases to 150. I don't think it is in line with the positioning of the Lion King; what makes me the most sad is that the last love king was urged twice."
迷你包很適合兩個人來，不過感覺沒有很乾淨，餐點都還不錯吃,"The mini bag is very suitable for two people, but it feels not very clean, and the meals are not bad."

打電話去問還有沒有包廂能訂，電話那頭問我們幾個人，我們說兩個，請問店員是在笑什麼？一邊跟我們講話一邊在旁邊笑，有夠沒禮貌，服務態度相當之差，真的是再也不會想再訂這邊的包廂,"Call to ask if there is a box that can be ordered, ask us a few people on the other side of the phone.

前天中午去唱歌，人好多喔，櫃檯人員一樣，有一陣子沒有去了，換新價錢了，我們是沒有訂位的，前面也有一組沒訂位的我看沒希望唱歌了，結果櫃檯人員在解說價錢時候，我們都聽的懂，前面的一對夫妻還帶小孩，櫃檯都說了那麼清楚了他們，還聽不懂，櫃檯人員一樣說了三次，還跟他說小孩也要算錢，還帶吃的，最後我看他們，還在考慮，我們就去問櫃檯小姐還有沒有位子，，他說等前面的那組客人不唱我們就有位子可以唱歌，最後帶小孩的還是進去唱歌了，我以為我們沒包廂可唱，櫃檯人員最後還是給我們唱，人很好 怎麼網路評論為何要寫他們不好，進包廂後，一樣會在說一次消費方式，這樣還不清楚嗎～我們下次還會在去獅子王唱歌，服務沒問題的，有問題的是，不想花錢的人，,"I went to sing at noon the day before yesterday. There are a lot of people. The counter staff, I haven't gone for a while, and the new price is changed. We have no reservation. There is also a group of in front of me. I don't want to sing. When the price is commentary, we all understand. The couple in front of them also brought children. The counter said so clearly that they did not understand. The counter staff said three times, and told him that the child had to calculate the money. I still eat it. Finally, I look at them, and we are still thinking. We go to ask the counter lady there is still a seat. He said that when the guests in front of the guests did not sing, we would have a seat to sing. Once, I thought we did n’t have a box to sing. The counter staff finally sang us. Why do people good online comments? Why not write them? After entering the box, we will also talk about the consumption method. Is this not clear?

包廂音響壞掉，結果換成比較低階的包廂，也不退錢
第一次唱歌遇到這麼雷的店🤮🤮🤮 …","服務態度超級爛，打電話問說六個人推薦什麼包廂，回：自己不會看嗎？

公館附近新開立的KTV館，小巧乾淨明亮，服務態度讓人覺得舒服,"The newly opened KTV Hall near the Mansion is small, clean and bright, and the service attitude makes people feel comfortable."
"一顆星是給以往覺得不錯的體驗。

然而現在服務素質真的是不敢評價太多欸
敷衍、催促、高姿態
貴公司管理須加強欸 畢竟已有那麼多人表示了 還不為所動 真的沒人會要光顧

只能說失望嚕：）","A star is a good experience in the past.

However, now the service quality is really dare not evaluate too much 欸
Perfunctory, urging, high posture
The management of your company must be strengthened. After all, so many people have expressed that they are not moving. No one will patronize.

Can only say disappointed 噜 :)"
"店員客氣禮貌
點歌又不會有很多廣告
重點是歌曲語種繁多我相當喜歡
可惜就是空間有點小
但大體上價格跟餐點還有服務都不錯呢!! 會再過來消費","The clerk is polite
There will be no advertisements for singing songs
The point is that there are many types of songs. I like it very much
It's a pity that the space is a bit small
But the general price is good with the meal and the service !! Will come again to consume again"
第一次來訪小包廂乾淨明亮，也有自己的廁所棒棒😀 …,第一次來訪小包廂乾淨明亮，也有自己的廁所棒棒😀 …
唱歌設備很讚還可以調整echo程度，炒飯好好吃，唱3小時費用也不貴，歌單也很齊全，之後唱歌都來這邊了！,"The singing equipment can be adjusted, and the degree of Echo can be adjusted. The fried rice is delicious. The cost of singing for 3 hours is not expensive, and the song list is very complete. After that, the singing is here!"
你們的副理是很厲害是嗎，貴公司晚班的服務生只是問一下要帶哪間包廂態度也好好的，我實在是看不懂副理在不爽什麼，帶進包廂完了後來把貴公司的服務生叫到櫃檯去還想打人？？？身為客人的我實在是滿頭問號,"Your deputy manager is very powerful, is it? The waiter of your company's evening shift just asks which box to bring is good. I really can't understand what the deputy manager is unhappy. The waiter wants to go to the counter and want to hit someone?IntersectionIntersectionAs a guest, I really have a question mark"
"很適合跟朋友們一起玩耍！
離學校很近 價格又不貴
有學生證的話還可以打折
讚讚 推薦","Very suitable for playing with friends!
It's close to the school, the price is not expensive
If you have a student ID
Recommended recommendation"
第二次去唱歌，包廂有大了一點A01包箱，櫃檯的姊姊人很好，服務生送餐眼神怪怪的，讓人看得就不舒服，服務不是很好需要改進,第二次去唱歌，包廂有大了一點A01包箱，櫃檯的姊姊人很好，服務生送餐眼神怪怪的，讓人看得就不舒服，服務不是很好需要改進
"服務好 態度佳  超愛來這邊🎤
歌選單比外面多好多 也好唱
會跟朋友大推🎤地方🥰🥰🥰 …","Good service attitude and good love to come here 🎤
The song selection is much better than the outside
Will push a lot with friends 大 ..."
音響設備很棒；消費有解釋跟前面的評論怎麼感覺不一樣；人員態度和善；帶我們進包廂的人員真的很好,The audio equipment is great; the consumption explanation is different from the previous comments; the attitude of the personnel is good; the person who takes us into the box is really good
"設備跟歌單都很新，很多好樂迪沒有的歌他們都有，真的唱得非常過癮！
只是跟他們要熱水壺結果來冷水，杯子也沒有清潔乾淨。
建議我2:30以前點餐，因為廚房2:30下班，結果2點前點好餐以後想說怎麼到3點都還沒送來，期間也有電話詢問，他們說有收到我的餐點訂單，後來再電話問一次發現廚房已經下班了但是忘記準備餐點，後來服務人員親自幫我準備餐點，說真的蠻好吃的😁餐點的水準都很高，還會想再吃一次的那種😍","The equipment and the song list are very new. They all have songs that are not available in good music, and they really sing very much!
Just ask them to take the hot kettle result to cold water, and the cup is not clean.
It is recommended to order before 2:30, because the kitchen is off work at 2:30, and after 2 o'clock before 2 o'clock, I want to say how to get it after 3 o'clock. During this time, they also asked. The order, later asked again to find out that the kitchen was off work but forgot to prepare meals. Later, the service staff helped me prepare meals in person. That kind of 😍"
"新開幕！裝潢很明亮 包廂每間風格不一樣
包廂有附廁所 這點加分！ 音響音質 各人覺得某ktv比較好😂 螢幕畫質好像沒有到解析度那麼高🥸🥸🥸
整體算是不錯🤓 …","New opening!The decoration is very bright, the box is different in each style
The box has a bonus point with the toilet!The sound quality of the audio feels that a KTV is better 😂 The screen quality seems to be as high as the resolution.
The overall is good ..."
"1/23早班有一位藍色制服 褲子寬鬆女服務生..從我們進來唱 到結束結帳，態度非常非常的差勁，按服務鈴點餐兇我們、送餐出去都不關門、公司優惠方案有bug，還這麼理直氣壯？破壞高興來唱歌的心情
這一顆星給1/18的服務生 態度很好，還有歌很多、音質好、柚子茶好喝，保溫效果很貼心","1/23 In the early morning shift, there is a young female waiter in blue uniform pants .. From coming in to sing to end the checkout, the attitude is very, very poor. Is there a bug, so straightforward?Destroy happiness to sing
This star has a good attitude to 1/18, and there are many songs, good sound quality, good grapefruit tea, and the insulation effect is very intimate"
五個人場地非常小，唱三個小時中間還被打斷警察臨檢等等浪費不少時間，最後點的歌也沒辦法唱完，時間一到就必須強制離開，總消費金額也很貴，第一次來cp值非常低,"The five people's venues are very small. In the middle of three hours, they were interrupted for a lot of time. The first time CP value is very low"
"不會再來第二次的店，服務差又什麼都沒說明，只會說「我不可能沒說，而且外面看板都有寫」。🙃
人員訓練也有問題，我們一開始打電話和櫃檯要溫水，來了一壺冰水，第二次要熱水等了20幾分鐘都沒來，再打一次才又拿一壺冰水來。我們和那個服務生確認才知道，櫃檯人員只告訴她我們要「水」。 …","I wo n’t come to the second time again, and the service is poor, but I will only say, ""I can't say it, and I have written on the outside.""Bleak
There are also problems with personnel training. At the beginning, we called warm water at the counter. A pot of ice water came. The second time I had to wait for 20 minutes to wait for 20 minutes. Then I took another pot of ice water.We and the waiter confirmed that the counter staff only told her that we wanted ""water"".Mowing"
昨天第一次去獅子王歡唱，真的12點多去唱很便宜，我們是附近的學生，櫃檯人員還會幫我們算一個人花多少錢，有吃又有喝的飲料一個人才花400元唱5小時真的超好的，櫃檯的姊姊真好中午去真的很划算,Yesterday I went to the Lion King to sing for the first time. It was really cheap to sing at 12 o'clock. We are nearby students. The counter staff will help us count how much money is spent. It's really good to sing for 5 hours for 400 yuan. The sister of the counter is really good at noon. It's really cost -effective.
平日下午來了2次，一次一個人來，一次帶小孩，服務都很親切，還特別招呼小孩糖果，小孩好開心，每間包廂都有廁所，就算一個人來也很方便。值得一提，餐點超好吃，是現炒現炸的，CP值很高的店，已4訪,"He came twice in the afternoon on weekdays. He came one by one and brought a child at a time. The service was very kind. He also specially greeted the child's candy. The child was so happy. Each box had toilets.It is worth mentioning that the meal is super delicious, it is fried, and the cp value is very high. It has been visited 4"
假日夜場超級無敵貴 服務人員會突然闖進來說給五星好評送炸物拼盤，不要相信上面的高評價,"The holiday night show super invincible and expensive service personnel will suddenly break in to say that the five -star praise will be given to the frying platter, don’t believe in the high evaluation above"
兩年前這裡剛開時，服務很好，點不到的歌，透過LINE或臉書反映，會幫忙增加，而且我之前也是這的常客，這幾個月再反映，連鳥都不鳥人，連在臉書你們的貼文下留言都不回，生意做起來了，也越來越不重視客人的感受了，不好意思，以後不想來了！,"When I first opened two years ago, the service that was very good. The song that could not be ordered, through LINE or Facebook reflection, would help increase, and I was a frequent visitor before. People, you do n’t even have a message under Facebook ’s post. The business is doing, and the business is increasingly not paying attention to the feelings of the guests. Sorry, I do n’t want to come in the future!"
電話中根本沒說外食要清潔費，叫了外送才說要清潔費，電話中確定沒說還據理力爭，服務態度差！,I did n’t say that the food was cleaning the cleaning fee at all. I asked the delivery to say that the cleaning fee was to be cleaned. I was sure that I did n’t say that I was struggling. The service attitude was poor!
"設備有夠差
左側按鈕完全沒亮燈
進來檢查的服務生只有一句 喔 壞了就關門出去
後來服務鈴一直響
一群人進來直接把我們唱歌電視關掉重開 又進來修服務鈴看電話看點歌機
進進出出沒有告知也沒有道歉連一句不好意思都沒有
完全不尊重消費者 體驗很差
櫃檯女服務員從一開始要開包廂就臭臉
消費內容也未告知清楚
後面沒敲門就開我們包廂跳針說什麼一開始有說可以轉包 不能帶外食有的沒的
事實是完全沒有 甚至用力甩門出去
後面來一個完全不在場的男服務生説他不可能沒說
我才是完全搞不懂^_^
後來和經歷就事論事 卻一直想伸手從我手上拿走我的錢
還問是不是沒錢付 要多可憐 乞丐店家
用大陸系統一堆錯字音響很炸
我看您們才是沒錢買版權=）
用盜版東西做盈利是違法的希望您們好自為之 這幾天也會讓您們知道的：）

真的是破店 第一次來體驗有夠糟 基本工作態度都沒有 員工素質跟音質糟糕至極 幫各位避雷","The equipment is poor enough
The left button on the left is not light at all
There is only one sentence who comes in to check
Later, the service bell kept ringing
A group of people came in and turned off the TV and turned it in and went in to repair the service bell to see the phone to watch the song machine
There is no informing and not apologizing, but there is no embarrassment, but I don't want to
I do not respect the consumer experience at all
The female waiter at the counter starts to open the box from the beginning
The consumption content is not clearly notified
If you do n’t knock on the door, open our box jumping needle and say what can be transferred at first.
The fact is that there is no or even throwing the door out
A waiter who is not present at all said that he could not say that he couldn't say
I don't understand at all^_^
Later, I always wanted to reach out with my hands and took away my money from my hand.
I also asked if there is no money to pay, how poor the beggar store
A bunch of misplaced sounds with the mainland system are very frying
I think you have no money to buy copyright =)
It is illegal to use pirated things to make profits. I hope you will make you know if you do it these days :)

"Sam超讚👍
環境很好 服務人員也很好
大學夜唱都會過來🤣","Sam
The environment is very good, the service staff is also very good
College night singing will come over 都"
男服務員態度非常不佳，臉很臭語速過快，聲音很小聲也很沒有耐心，並且對收費等事宜明顯不甚瞭解。另外帶外食的清潔費不透明（甚至要連同其他費用加收一成）,"The male waiter attitude was very poor, his face was very stinky and fast, his voice was very loud and unattended, and he didn't know much about charges and other matters.In addition, the cleaning cost of food with external food is opaque (even 10 % increase with other expenses)"
環境很整潔沒菸味服務也很不錯，但歌詞字幕有的偏快對不上，撲克牌還有骰子要用買的跟別的ktv不太一樣😅 …,"The environment is very clean, no smoke, and the service is also very good, but the lyrics and subtitles are not right. Poker cards and dice are not the same as other KTVs ..."
帶鹹水雞進場吃，竟被收清潔費500元，事前沒有提醒，官網也沒有提到這個規定，感覺隨便喊價，答應會付錢厚還被說不可以再叫外食，感覺很怕賺不夠錢…生意只做一次，其實會賺更少。,"When I entered the market with salted water chickens, I was charged 500 yuan for cleaning fee. I did not remind you beforehand. The official website did not mention this rule. I felt that I would be able to pay the money. You can't make enough money ... The business is only once, and you will earn less."
自己網路上價目表上價格時間變來變去 不清不楚 問個問題就不耐煩 粉專要po文是不會把具體時間價格打清楚嗎 一群人看了都解讀成不一樣的🙄 …,"If the price time on the price on the Internet is changing, the problem is unknown to ask a question. If you are impatient, do you want PO text, will you not make the specific time and price clear?"

想說新開幕去的結果唱歌貴、食物貴，還要收服務費，還不如去星聚點或好樂迪，而且包廂小音效差一堆歌還盜版的,"If you want to say that the newly opened results are expensive and expensive, and you have to charge the service fee. It is better to go to the star gathering point or good Ledi, and the small sound of the box is a pile of songs."
在我們面前罵員工是怎樣啊，根本沒心情唱了😮‍💨,What is the scolding employee in front of us?
說明非常模糊，價格卻是很貴，感覺被耍，不想再來,"The description is very vague, but the price is very expensive, I feel playing, I don’t want to come again"
MV來源非常奇怪，有些歌曲整首不完整，廁所有很重的消毒水味道，一顆星給鹽酥雞好吃,MV來源非常奇怪，有些歌曲整首不完整，廁所有很重的消毒水味道，一顆星給鹽酥雞好吃
環境優、副理很漂亮、待人態度很棒！,"The environment is excellent, the deputy manager is very beautiful, and the attitude is great!"
歌曲可以快進跟倒轉有夠讚！,Songs can be fast -moving and inverted!
服務態度很差，價格不透明，沒有得到應有的權利。整個體驗真的很糟糕！,"The service attitude is poor, the price is opaque, and there is no right to get it.The whole experience is really bad!"
"台灣最好的KTV，我喜歡電視上有二維碼，你可以掃描它來遙控或點歌。

很棒的服務和環境。","The best KTV in Taiwan, I like QR codes on TV, you can scan it to control or sing remotely.

Great service and environment."

"Don't go! They just charge you thing out of nowhere. So you have to pay 460 ntd per person for singing (this part is normal I guess). Then they just charge us 150ntd for minimal consumption. Weold' at all. We told them that we didn't know but they kept saying that because we don't understand Chinese. I understand Chinese and I feel like it is just scam. I am not the only one comsaying this in the is just scam. I am not the only one comsaying this in the comsayment! we were aware of this fee we wouldn't have complained. But they only told us when we had to pay. We had a good time but this part just ruined the experience.

別去！ 他們真的不禮貌！ 他們告訴我們要付150NTD 因為我們點不夠飲料. 可是他們從來沒有告訴這個費。他們跟我們說我們不懂中文。我很生氣！ 我真的不推薦這個KTV。","Don't go! They just charge you thing out of nowhere.

好吃一直吃 真的很好吃,"It's delicious for always eating delicious, it's really delicious"
就服務而言，這是非常昂貴的。我們什麼也沒吃，每人付了700。,"In terms of service, this is very expensive.We didn't eat anything, and each person paid 700."
