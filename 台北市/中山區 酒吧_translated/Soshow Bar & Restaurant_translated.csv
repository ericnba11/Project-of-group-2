用餐空間很大，還有沙發區，真的很chill～～～

🔺月見紅燒肉寶島炸醬麵 $320
這個我覺得超好吃！！雖然不是我點的XD不過我下次去絕對會首選這個麵，粗麵體吸滿醬汁，很ㄕㄨㄚˋ嘴！！

🔺辣肉醬義大利麵佐溫泉蛋 $330
這是我點的，因為我超愛各種肉醬義大利麵，但常常踩雷😅
他們的肉醬還是偏稀，不太推～

🔺蒜香鴨賞義大利麵 $280
超漂亮的擺盤，清炒的基本上不踩雷都可以放心點！

🔺干貝松露燉飯 $420
奢華燉飯，不過干貝只有兩顆🤣燉飯的松露味還蠻濃郁的，燉飯有稍微吃出米心還不錯～

🔺菜脯臘腸烘蛋 $160
快要凌晨12點的時候又加點了這個，跟我認知的烘蛋不太一樣，不過如果想說菜脯臘腸厚蛋，可能就會覺得很不錯！

那天有活動，事先訂位四人以上好像就送一隻 #酒燒大魷
不過店員感覺沒很熟悉點火的流程（？），一直點不起來旁邊的店員還偷笑XDD
魷魚的酒香氣很濃郁，但吃起來沒有什麼酒味～

可以刷卡，有收服務費10%","2024.09.16 First visit
There is a lot of dining space, and there is a sofa area, which is really chill ~~~

This is me, because I love all kinds of meat sauce, but I often step on thunder.
Their meat sauce is still thin, not too pushing ~

义 Garlic duck duck rewarding pasta $ 280
If you are super beautiful, you can rest assured if you do n’t step on the thunder!

饭 Dry scallop pine dew stewed rice $ 420
Luxury stewed rice, but the smell of the truffle of only two stewed rice stewed rice is quite rich. It is not bad to eat rice with a little rice ~

Baked sausage baked eggs of sausage sausage $ 160
It is about to add this again at 12 am, which is not the same as the roasting egg I know, but if you want to say that the vegetables are thick and thick eggs, you may feel very good!

There is an event that day, and if you book more than four people in advance, it seems to get a #那 那 那 那 那 那
However, the clerk feels familiar with the process of igniting (?), I can't click on the clerk next to the clerk to laugh at XDD
Squid's wine is strong, but there is no wine taste ~

You can swipe the card, the service fee is 10%"
"調酒不錯，酒體夠並可以喝得出果香的層次，擺盤也樸實，適合喜歡喝雞尾酒的！
服務也不錯親切！
相比於東區餐酒館，這裡的酒跟服務都很實在。

唯一缺點就是餐食需要再加強，嫩豆腐不錯，其他都可以再加強一點。","The bartending is good, the wine is enough and can drink the layer of fruit aroma, and the plate is simple, suitable for drinking cocktails!
The service is also good!
Compared with the East District Restaurant, the wine and service here are very real.

The only disadvantage is that the meal needs to be strengthened. The tender tofu is good, and others can be strengthened a little."
"一間頗有特色的店，店在二樓，因店內有客人沒拍餐廳的樣子，座位蠻多的，還有一個小陽台可以出去抽煙，料理跟酒走台灣在地風，使用許多常見的台灣食材，我不喝酒，點了二杯無酒精調飲，但好好喝，尤其紫蘇青蘋果裡面還放了我喜歡的哇沙比，會有一點辣口微嗆，很有趣的口感，朋友點的台中再芋佳人，我試喝了一小口，就像是在吃甜點般，入口像芋頭奶昔，口感順滑甜而不膩，吞下去後竄出來的溫和酒香充滿口腔，真的好喝。
至於料理我們大推鹹酥雞，對，就是鹹酥雞，味道內容物完全一樣，真的像是剛去外面鹹酥雞攤買回來的一樣，還用紙袋裝著，我忍不住問店員有沒有竹籤⋯，這真的好吃，味道？就是鹹酥雞；另外一個我推是避風塘炸中卷，中巻新鮮軟嫩吃的到Q彈的口感又不會過硬，炸的恰到好處的酥加上很多蒜酥，好溂嘴，另外一個是松露薯條，這也好好吃，讓我忍不住一根接一根，結論，菜色蠻多有許多台灣味，酒更是，店員服務也很好，會熱心為您介紹，是朋友下班聚會的好地點。","A distinctive shop, the shop is on the second floor, because there are guests in the store that do not shoot the restaurant, there are quite a lot of seats, and a small balcony can go out to smoke. In Taiwan's ingredients, I do n’t drink. I ordered two cups of wine without drinking, but it ’s easy to drink, especially my favorite wow Sabi in the Perisia -green apples. The order of Taichung, the beauty of Taro, I tried a little bit, just like eating desserts, the entrance was like taro milkshake, the taste was smooth but not greasy, and the mild wine aroma after swallowing was full of mouth. Special.
As for the cooking, we push the salty crispy chicken, yes, the salty crispy chicken, the taste content is exactly the same, it really looks like I just went to the salty crispy chicken stall to buy it back. Without bamboo sticks, this is really delicious and taste?It is salty crispy chicken; the other one is the frying of the wind pond fried, the taste of the fresh and tenderness of the 巻 and tenderness of the Q bomb will not be too hard. Tsoda fries, which is also delicious, so I can't help but one after another. Conclusion, there are many Taiwanese flavors in the dishes. The wine service is very good. I will introduce it to you. A good place for the party."
在中山站跟北車捷運中間，服務很親切，餐點還可以，調酒不是走網美系但喝起來都很順，適合朋友聚會，建議要先訂位。,"In the middle of the MRT of Zhongshan Station, the service is very kind. The meal is okay. The bartender is not a net beauty but it is very smooth. It is suitable for friends to meet. It is recommended to order first."
"🛂🛂環境蠻靜謐舒服, 雖然沒有浮誇的主題跟裝飾, 走的是種沉穩的風格
🫰🫰服務也蠻到味的, 應對都蠻得宜  但某些區域客自帶SPEAKER的高八度笑聲 我我我   開放空間  我忍了😒🤣🤣  ,  餐點都蠻不錯的, 也還提供開水    酒類調酒外感覺有點琴酒為主(有在喝的可以來交流)

🉐🈴🆙塔香鮮蝦蘑菇   微辣炒爆香的路線品項新鮮, 還不錯吃 但份量算蠻緊湊的
🉐🈴🆒蒜香鴨賞義大利麵 :  看似賣相還好 , 吃起來別有風味 , 碎鴨賞散落搭配有點甜漬豆皮的風味, 這風味組何蠻好有推

🆒🆙🈴🈵南洋咖哩炸雞翅:   份量有點比我想像中還多 給了8隻不小的翅, 其實粿粉咖哩味不是非常明確 , 重點是 沾醬 ,不過濃也不水的微泰是不辣酸甜醬, 會讓人想貪心多沾一點的搭配   這個也蠻OK的下酒菜

ℹ️嘉義 雲霧檜賞   朋友喝重的習慣了  覺得偏淡

可再訪的店","The environment is quite quiet and comfortable, although there is no exaggerated theme and decoration, walking is a calm style
味 The service is pretty good. It is quite appropriate to deal with it, but some regional guests with Speaker's high laughter. I am open space. I endure it. It feels like a little piano wine outside the alcoholic bartender (if you are drinking, you can communicate)

菇 The tower incense fresh shrimp mushrooms are slightly spicy and stir -fried.
义 Garlic duck rewarding Italian noodles: It seems that it is okay to sell, and it tastes good. The broken duck is scattered with a bit of sweet bean skin flavor.

炸 Nanyang Curry Fried Chicken Wings: The portion is a bit more than I think of 8 wings. In fact, the flavor of the pink curry is not very clear. Spicy sweet and sour sauce, it will make people want to be greedy and sticky. This is also OK.

雾️ Chiayi Cloud Mist, I am used to the habit of rewarding my friends, I feel lighter

Re -visit shop"
"鴨賞義大利麵非常好吃👏🏻
松露薯條有點油 松露味不夠
九宮格的酒，好看😆

下班聚會好地方。料理跟酒走台灣在地風，使用台灣每個省的食材來做調酒，很有特色。,"Good place to party off work.Cooking and wine walking in Taiwan in the ground, using the ingredients in each province of Taiwan for bartending, which is very distinctive."
酒吧的氣氛不錯，且放了很多懷舊老歌，餐點和調酒都很棒，不讓你失望，酒單也很用心設計，充滿濃濃的台灣氣息，有台灣的故事，很不錯的酒吧哦👍,"The atmosphere of the bar is good, and there are many nostalgic old songs. The meals and bartending are great. It is not disappointed. The wine list is also very carefully designed. It is full of Taiwan's atmosphere. Cricket"
"隱身在中山北路二樓的餐酒館，店內有轉播球賽大螢幕，
主題調酒類滿特別的，用台灣各城市的特色為主題命名，也有標榜濃度，我們點了四杯都滿好喝的，只是杯子有點小杯一下就喝完，哈，另外兩杯點噤聲系列的何日君再來和燒肉粽調酒，因為看到鹹蛋黃感覺很有趣，這款味道比較MAN很適合男生喝。
食物方便都不錯，除了醉雞肉質太柴了，其他XO醬蘿蔔糕、干貝燉飯，肉醬義大利麵、松露薯條、避風塘炸花枝、牛小排都好吃。
禮拜二晚間居然客滿，生意很好~~","Hidden on the dining tavern on the second floor of Zhongshan North Road, there are big screens on the game game.
The theme bartending is full of special. It is named after the characteristics of various cities in Taiwan, and there is a concentration. We ordered four cups to be delicious, but the cup is a little bit of a cup. He Rijun in the sound series and bartender with roasted meat, because it feels interesting to see salted egg yolk, this taste is more suitable for boys to drink.
The food is convenient. Except for the drunk chicken, it is too good. Other xo sauce radish cakes, scallops stew rice, meat sauce Italian noodles, truffle fries, fried flowers on the wind pond, and cow small ribs are delicious.
On the evening of the worship, the business is full, and the business is very good ~~"
"空間寬裕，彼此之間不會有被打擾的感覺，服務人員會定期確認是否有應整理的餐盤等等。
當天也有看到兩個大螢幕轉播的棒球比賽，身歷其境的感覺更增添氣氛的舒適，若是單純為看比賽而去，想必也是視覺上的一大饗宴！
調酒各有特色，當天最喜歡的是「燒肉粽」，適合當第二或第三杯的酒來品嚐，酒感較重，不習慣的話先別喝太大口。花生香氣濃郁，其他滋味…應當自己嘗試看看～
干貝松露燉飯很好吃，松露薯條超級好吃！絕對值得與人相約時大塊朵頤一番。","The space is full, and there will be no feeling of being disturbed by each other. The service staff will regularly confirm whether there is a dining plate that should be organized.
On the same day, I saw two big screen broadcast baseball games. The feeling of being in the realm adds more comfort. If it is simply for watching the game, it must be a visual feast!
The bartender has its own characteristics. The favorite of the day is ""roasted meat"", which is suitable for tasting as the second or third cup of wine. The wine feels heavier. If you are not used to, don't drink too much.The peanuts have a strong aroma, other tastes ... you should try it yourself ~
Dry scallops are delicious, and truffle fries are super delicious!It is definitely worthy of meeting with people."
"氣氛100、服務100、調酒100！

調酒師so caring 好好聊
坐吧枱可以望到佢哋調酒 實在好有趣🤣","Thinking of using a map as the theme is interesting and talented

The clerk is enthusiastic about the innovative taste. From time to try early; there is no thunder for meals, very delicious food restaurant with high quality"
"旁邊就有停車場非常方便；調酒很有趣，緊扣台灣主題，味道有層次，食物也很適合下酒，點的菜看照片供參考，都很好吃，唯獨薯條不知道是不是炸過頭內部粉粉的表皮也不酥脆；不過紹興豆腐味道很夠，表皮口感好香氣有；避風塘中卷炸得很好，就是稍微有點太辣；帶骨牛小排醬比較少一點，但肉好吃，洋蔥圈綿綿的醬料很很剛好，好吃；點了四季紅和台北信仰艋舺，四季紅酒味足，不過苦韻重了一點點，比較喜歡艋舺信仰，旁邊有一艘小船載著小零食代表供品，蠻有趣的，用紅酒當基底喝下去順口，最後竄上一股檀香味覺得很好玩。
用餐三小時時間很夠，抵消平日350也很親民。","There is a parking lot next to it. It is very convenient to bartender. The theme of Taiwan is close to the theme of Taiwan. The taste is layered. The food is also suitable for wine. The skin of the powder inside the head is not crispy; however, Shaoxing tofu tastes enough, and the epidermis has a good aroma; the roll in the hedge is a little bit too spicy; It's delicious, the sauces of the onion circle are very good, delicious; ordered the four seasons of red and Taipei faith. The four seasons of red wine are full of taste, but the bitter charm is a little bit. It represents the offerings of small snacks. It is quite interesting. It is fun to use red wine as the base. Finally, a sandalwood smell is fun.
It is enough for three hours to eat, and it is also very close to the people's on weekdays."
"第二攤到訪
朋友推薦
有別於上一攤太吵
這邊很適合好好說話聊天聚會
（撇除旁邊慶生玩樂偶爾尖叫這樣）

叫了六公格
發現只有四杯茶酒
另外兩杯是果汁
但是附上滿格茶點剛好可以配其他酒類
算瑕不掩瑜
店員專業也好相處

餐點部分紹興豆腐太大塊
以至於醬汁蘸不太上很可惜
避風頭花枝倒是非常入味
是值得推薦的店家","Visiting the Second
Recommendation
Different from the last stall, it's too noisy
This is very suitable for talking and chatting together

The other two cups are fruit juice
But it is attached to the Mange refreshment that can be matched with other alcoholic categories

我不會承認我是來看服務生美眉的，愛了愛了~,"I won't admit that I came to see the waiter's eyebrows, I loved it ~"
地區調酒蠻有創意的，也好喝！,Regional bartending is quite creative and delicious!
很適合下班後跟朋友或同事來小酌一下.餓了也有主食可吃喔.九宮格酒一次品八種風味有酸、甜、茶香、花香比較適合女性朋友.餐點中規矩矩、鹽酥雞有點油、soshow bar就是個放鬆的地方,"It is very suitable for a drink with friends or colleagues after work. If you are hungry, there are staple foods to eat. Jiugongge wine is more suitable for female friends with eight flavors, sweet, tea, and floral fragrance. A little oil, soshow bar is a relaxed place"

"已經來了兩次都覺得這裡很讚！
酒都很好喝，很有特色，最喜歡的是桃園

調酒師也都很熱情的介紹，也會帶一些酒類的歷史，非常的有趣～

這包鹹酥雞有蠻多料的，鹹酥雞、四季豆、香菇、百頁、香菇、甜不辣等，吃起來算是蠻好吃的，剛開始店員有說很大份，但個人覺得多慮了，最後是忘記倒出來擺盤了，有點可惜。","At about seven or eight o'clock, the store is full of people. Although there are no reservations on the day, there are still bar areas to sit. The store has a QR code brand to make you look at the menu online. I feel that the service ecology is not bad.

"9/10 19：15 分 外場戴眼鏡的外場服務生講話真的有夠沒禮貌+莫名奇妙

後來朋友帶伴手禮來，我想欣賞一下蛋黃酥+朋友說可能有散掉所以想檢查一下

盒子開1/3此男服務生立即靠近再次提醒不能用外食，我回覆我沒有要吃
男服務生回覆：那就請你不要碰它

請問我要不要碰我的伴手禮跟貴公司的服務生有什麼關係，需要他同意嗎？
關他什麼事，到底^^

很有台灣特色的酒吧，有環島系列調酒都是用各地食材！很喜歡西西里咖啡調酒，特調的shot九宮格也不錯！,"There are bars with Taiwan characteristics. There are ingredients around the island series of bartending!I like Sicily coffee bartending, and the special SHOT Jiugongge is also good!"
"一個有點像Jim的服務生很客氣，但是是一間整體細節及餐點都需要加強的餐酒館
（不過有大螢幕可以看球賽還不錯
1.菜單破損不更換。小吃店就算了，但是身為一間人均六七百以上的餐廳真的很不妥
2.廁所環境不優。洗手台竟然是一個類似洗拖把的大水槽，不是一間餐廳該出現的裝潢
3.餐點普普。xo醬蘿蔔糕口感偏硬，感覺有些炸過頭
整餐吃下來最推薦南洋燉飯  另外鹹酥雞也還不錯，不過九層塔竟然是連著整條粗莖下去炸，根本無法咀嚼。
希望至少菜單可以重新設計一份","A waiter like Jim is very polite, but it is a restaurant that needs to be strengthened in the overall details and meals.
(However, there are big screens to watch the ball game pretty good
1. The menu is damaged and not replaced.Even if the snack bar is, it is really inappropriate to be a restaurant with a per capita of more than six or seven hundred.
2. The toilet environment is not good.The washing table turned out to be a large sink similar to a wash mop, not the decoration that should appear in a restaurant.
3. Pupu.XO sauce radish cake has a hard mouth, and it feels a bit fried
It is not bad to recommend Nanyang stewed rice and salty crispy chicken, but the nine -story tower turned out to be frying through the whole thick stem, and it could not be chewed at all.
Hope at least the menu can be redesigned"
"2022.12.17 初訪
#餐酒館 #可刷卡 #可刷載具 #建議預約 #用餐限時三小時

🥜餐點：
紹興雞蛋豆腐很值得點，紹興酒的臭味被煮掉了，只剩下很香的酒氣和甜味，雞蛋豆腐炸過後外皮泡在紹興酒裡吸附很多醬汁，吃起來非常香！

XO醬蘿蔔糕是炸蘿蔔糕，外表非常硬，如果不搭配XO醬吃就沒什麼味道。

🍹調酒：
因為朋友介紹這家的特色是台灣環島調酒，因此抱著很大的期待來體驗，但說實在調酒在我喝起來偏中間，沒有太多驚艷感。
店家IG提供的線上菜單和現場實際有差距，建議以現場為準。
覺得（近期沒有換酒單的話）比較推薦可以嘗試的是台北和拉拉山水蜜桃這兩款。

宜蘭的white Negroni苦甜平衡的度沒把握好，有苦沒有甜，金桔味道很不明顯，感覺真的就只是插在旁邊配著吃的garnish。

花蓮的特色調酒加入剝皮辣椒infused，整杯看起來很清爽但喝起來很辣，是那種一路從喉頭辣整個食道的刺激辣，外加米香上灑滿五香粉之類的，我那杯邊喝邊各種想打噴嚏。

🌚服務：
我們18:00 準時抵達，大約18:10左右點完餐，當時店內除了我們這桌2人之外大概還有另外2桌3-4人，點餐時店員詢問酒類是餐前上還是餐後上，我們是說希望能餐前上。

餐點大約18:25左右陸續上桌，其中送錯了一道炸物（點洋蔥圈但送來的是松露薯條）當下馬上請外場撤下。

18:40左右同行夥伴決定去催一下酒，因為餐點幾乎都吃得差不多了但酒還沒上。
18:55時還是沒看到酒又去催第二次，這次才收到回覆說開始做，又等了10分鐘左右兩杯調酒才上桌。

建議最好是酒上桌時馬上點下一杯，因為19點後人變多又等更久，一杯酒大概都要等候30-40分鐘不等的時間。

最後，FB粉專、inline預約頁面、網路公告的菜單裡面都沒有提到用餐限時三小時，當天20:30突然收到服務生告知用餐僅到21點時有點傻眼。

用餐過程中因為花了很長的時間在等餐等酒很無聊，所以一直喝水，店家提供的水瓶空了兩次，都是等我們主動找服務生才能換水瓶，結果20:40一結完帳，店家看我們桌上第三瓶空了就直接拿走，也沒有再詢問是否需要補，很明顯感覺就是在趕人。

當天我們2人總計消費4200元，遠超過低消限制。21:10左右離開時，店內至少還有2桌2人位以及一桌4人位是空著的。
是，當天消費超過低消很多不代表就理所當然坐很久，但希望店家至少可以在能夠明顯看到的地方標註用餐限時的規定，或者至少當天在客人入座時可以再提醒一下。

可能因為事前很期待導致當天體驗落差較大，沒有讓人想回訪的慾望。
看評價發現之前也有人提到外場服務的狀況，希望店家可以注意一下。","2022.12.17 First visit

🥜 Meal:
Shaoxing egg tofu is worthy of pointing. The odor of Shaoxing wine has been cooked. Only the fragrant wine and sweetness are left. After the egg tofu is fried, the outer skin is soaked in Shaoxing wine to adsorb a lot of sauce. It tastes very fragrant!

XO sauce radish cake is fried radish cake, which has a very hard appearance.

🍹 bartender:
Because my friends introduced this family to Taiwan's bartender, I experienced a lot of expectations, but to say that the bartender was in the middle, there was not much amazing feeling.
The online menu provided by the store IG is actually a gap between the scene, and it is recommended to prevail on the spot.
I think (if you do n’t change the wine recently), it is recommended to try the two models of Taipei and Lala landscape.

Yilan's White Negroni's bitter and sweet balance is not sure, there is no sweetness, the taste of kumquats is not obvious, it feels like it is just inserted by the garnish that is eaten next to it.

Hualien's characteristic bartending adds skin pepper INFUSED. The whole cup looks very refreshing but drinks very spicy. I want to sneeze all kinds of drinking.

🌚 Service:
We arrived on time at 18:00, and the meal was clicked at about 18:10. At that time, there were about 2 tables of 3-4 people in addition to the two people in our table. Later, we mean that we hope to be before meals.

The meal was on the table about 18:25, and the wrong fried material (some onion circles but sent the truffle fries) immediately immediately asked the field to withdraw.

Around 18:40, his companion decided to urge the wine, because the meal was almost eaten, but the wine was not yet on.
At 18:55, I still didn't see the wine for the second time. This time I received a reply and said that I started to do it, and I waited for about 10 minutes to get on the table for about 10 minutes.

It is recommended that it is best to order the next cup immediately when the wine is on the table, because after 19 o'clock, there are more and longer, and a cup of wine will probably wait for 30-40 minutes.

In the end, the FB Fan Specialty, Inline's appointment page, and the menu announced on the Internet did not mention the limited time for three hours. At 20:30 on the same day, the waiter was a little dumbfounded when the meal was only 21 o'clock.

During the meal process, because I spent a long time waiting for meals and waiting for wine, I kept drinking water. The water bottle provided by the store was empty twice. After finishing the account, the store saw the third bottle on our table and took it away. He didn't ask if you needed to make up. Obviously, it felt like he was catching people.

On the same day, the two of us spent 4,200 yuan, far exceeding the low limit restrictions.When we left around 21:10, there were at least 2 tables and two people in the store, and a table of 4 people was empty.
Yes, the consumption of more than low consumption on the day does not mean that it takes a long time for a long time, but I hope that the store can at least marked the dining time regulations at least in the place that can be clearly seen, or at least when the guests are in the seat, they can remind them again.

It may be because I am looking forward to the gap between the same day, there is no desire to return to visit.
Seeing the evaluation found that someone mentioned the situation of external services before, I hope the store can pay attention."

"餐點好吃，酒也都不錯喝。
把台灣整個島都喝完了（只差古坑沒賣），幾乎味道都不錯！
餐點部分點了松露薯條和鍋巴起士泡菜都很下酒，馬鈴薯烘蛋比較普通一點，但旁邊的蜂蜜餅乾很香很好吃！","The meal is delicious and the wine is good.
Drink the entire island of Taiwan (only the ancient pit is not sold), and it tastes almost good!
Some of the meals ordered the truffle potato strips and the pots of pots. The potato eggs are more ordinary, but the honey biscuits next to them are very fragrant and delicious!"
主食配菜都超好吃份量剛好，調酒都非常有創意會激發收集癖的人點一輪啊，認真推推，氣氛也真的很棒,"The staple food and side dishes are super delicious, and the bartending is very creative."
"隱藏在中山區二樓的餐酒館，平日晚上前來意外地還挺多人的，店內正在轉播世足比賽，有不少外國人齊聚一堂，非常熱鬧！建議事先訂位。

酒單結合台灣地名與在地特色食物來設計，十分有創意，不過整體酒感偏低。另外食物方面選擇不多，份量也偏少，有點可惜。

其中一位男服務生很親切，招待我們很多輪shot👍🏻 比較適合吃飽飯後再來此小酌～

＊週日～四每人低消$350
＊週五&六每人低消$550

【台中-再芋佳人】
喝起來像是融化後的蛋捲冰淇淋，芋頭味不是很明顯，整杯非常甜毫無酒感，習慣喝妹酒的應該會很喜歡

【台南-柚飄香】
柚子酒幾乎蓋過了所有的味道，比較可惜雖為茶酒卻嚐不到鐵觀音茶味

【高雄-盛夏燕巢】
十分清爽的一杯調酒，以水果風味為主，入口即能嚐到芭樂的香氣","The dining tavern hidden in the second floor of Zhongshan District, there are still many people who come to the evening on weekdays. The store is broadcasting the World Football Competition. Many foreigners gathered together, which is very lively!It is recommended to order in advance.

The wine list is very creative, but the overall wine feel is very creative, but the overall wine feel is low.In addition, there are not many foods for food, and the amount of portion is too small, which is a pity.

It looks like the melted egg roll ice cream. The taro taste is not very obvious. The whole cup is very sweet and wineless. Those who are used to drinking girls should like it.

【Tainan-Pomelo Fragrant】
Grapefruit wine has almost all the flavors. Unfortunately, although it is tea wine, it can’t taste Tieguanyin tea flavor.

【Kaohsiung-Smart Swallow Nest】

This dining tavern is very large and the location is very comfortable ~ It is very suitable for three or five friends to gather together!There are also positions that provide even 10 -person tables. There are also smoking areas in the store. You don’t have to run to the first floor to smoke, which is very convenient.
The clerk's attitude is also very good!
We ordered 11 cups of around the island this time. It is a pity that it is because the ancient pit coffee bartender did not drink it.
The bartending is very smooth. The favorite in it is the bartending of Kenting and Taipei, full of flavor ❤️

The honey biscuits comes with potato eggs are also very special!It's delicious enough (I also asked the waiter for one more piece"
"下著雨的週六夜晚，滿滿的人潮在這完美的Soshow裡，調酒與餐點都非常驚艷，比想像中的再更好吃許多，很適合想吃好料又想喝好酒的饕客們。

精心設計的酒單從台灣各地農特產出發，環島台灣調酒系列，結合各地水果、中國茶等元素調配出充滿家鄉回憶的美味。充分感受台灣熱帶風情，值得全部都點一輪來試試。保證不會失望。

餐點菜色美味也不輸調酒的華麗轉身，從台灣特色鹹酥雞出發，還有綜合香腸的台式料理，也有義大利麵與燉飯等主食，不管是吃飽或下酒都非常對味。

The meal is delicious and does not change the gorgeous turn of the wine. From the Taiwan's characteristic salty crispy chickens, there are also tabletop dishes with integrated sausages, and there are staple foods such as Italian noodles and stew. Essence

"餐點不錯吃，適合朋友小聚。
但是單價高與限時3小時的部分，性價比不高。

"隱藏在二樓的餐酒館，平日晚上一開店就來所以可以兩個人坐大位置xD

食物選擇不多，表現也不算差，低消不高；酒的九宮格看起來很酷，但某一杯味道超神秘，超像感冒糖漿，柚香調酒整杯都是柚子味少了茶的香，Negroni 味道不錯！","Hidden in the dining tavern on the second floor, when you open the store on weekdays, you can sit in a large position XD

There are not many food choices, and the performance is not bad. The low consumption is not high; Xiang, Negroni tastes good!"
每種調酒都很有特色，但說不上是非常好喝，炸物普通，CP值不高：環境稍嫌擁擠，但還算輕鬆自在，聊天的好地方,"Each bartending is very distinctive, but it is not very delicious, the fried object is ordinary, the CP value is not high: the environment is slightly crowded, but it is quite relaxed."
東西好吃，老闆親切！推推！,"The things are delicious, the boss is kind!Push!"
"下班吃飯小酌一杯的好地方。
鹹酥雞很特別的擺盤方式，用台灣形狀的盤子裝放，搭配鹹酥雞的紙袋，好有感覺⋯
店內的調酒口味，以台灣每個都市著名的產物調配而成，這杯以台東洛神花調製而成⋯（剛開始前幾口酒感比較重，過陣子冰塊溶完之後，喝起來就比較像是果汁的口感，酸甜滋味）

以台灣為主題的餐酒館⋯
入口處不太明顯，一不小心就會錯過囉～請仔細張大眼睛👀看看唷～","A good place to eat after get off work.
The salty crispy chicken is very special to put on the plate. It is placed in the shape of a Taiwanese plate and paired with the salty crispy chicken paper bag, so I feel it

在北車一帶廝混多年的我經過這裡上千次不等，一直沒發現這裡有這麼合我胃口的酒吧。調酒相當出挑，其設計讓顧客除了可以感受台灣各地風光外，也可以從古到今一一品嘗各個時代的風味，甚至可以緬懷兒時的各種回憶。,"I have been in the north car for many years, and I have ranged thousands of times here. I haven't found that there is such a bar that fits my appetite.The bartending is quite out of. The design allows customers to feel the flavors of various times from ancient times to today, and even remembers all kinds of memories from ancient times to today."

氣氛服務都很好，有很多的調酒可選，也有威士忌。食物口味也都不錯。當晚點的酒都蠻遲送達，因為一下子突然太多客人，老闆為了表示歉意，招待一些免費的shots給我們，人很好的老闆。這邊大約每人500台幣的抵消，酒的價格一般，不會太貴，以後有時間還是會來!","Great Atmosphere n service! A Lot of Cocktail Selections.

In order to apologize, the boss entertained some free Shots for us. The good boss.About 500 Taiwan dollars per person here, the price of the wine is generally not too expensive, and it will still come in the future!"
"酒雖然好喝但是整體服務不會讓人想再來
台北有特色又好喝的店很多
不知道為什麼會這麼可惜的一家店？
1. 點了高雄奶雞貴妃酒
喝到一半才發現（想起來？）
跟menu的形容的味道不太一樣
杯子也不一樣（menu上面有畫出來）
於是詢問服務生 （是真的好奇）
結果他說他們有改版，但是點餐的時候怎麼都沒有告知我們？微傻眼
客人看著menu點就是想喝那個口味 結果送上來完全不一樣～雖然不會不好喝 但都沒有告知 要詢問才有解答
2.外場服務生完全不看外場也是蠻猛的
不是在跟同事bartender聊天就是看著某處在發呆
好幾次招手 即使bartender有跟我們對到眼也都裝沒看到繼續做酒也不提醒外場服務生（外場服務生就在他眼前或是在跟他講話～）
外場服務生即使不需要巡場 但是至少基本眼神該掃射看看 當天非常多桌招手都招很久～
只能說可能不是很想上班？","Although the wine is delicious, the overall service will not make people want to come again
There are many specialty and delicious shops in Taipei
I don't know why it is a pity?
1. Order the Kaohsiung milk chicken Guifei wine
I found it halfway before I found it (remembered?)
It is not the same as Menu described
The cup is also different (Menu is drawn on it)
So ask the waiter (really curious)
As a result, he said that they had a revision, but why didn't we tell us when ordering?Slightly
The guest looked at the Menu point just to drink that taste and sent it. It was completely different ~ Although it is not bad, they did not tell you to ask if you want to ask
2. The waiter in the field is quite fierce at all without watching the field at all
Either chatting with colleagues Bartender or watching somewhere in a daze
Several times, even if Bartender had a good time with us, he didn't see that he continued to make wine and did not remind the waiter in the field.
Even if the waiter does not need to be a tour, at least the basic eyes should be shot to see that many tables beckoned on the same day to recruit for a long time ~
Can you only say that you might not want to go to work?"
當天是臨時預約去慶生的，有事先電話詢問店家是否可以先冷藏蛋糕，店家很親切表示可以，隨後與朋友們用餐完後才到店內慶生，被安排到靠窗的角落，點餐時可能要辛苦一點才能攔住店員。調酒還不錯好喝，當月壽星有shot招待活動，詢問店員是否可以幫我們合照，店員也都非常願意且親切。,"On the same day, I made a temporary appointment to celebrate the birthday. Some of them asked the store in advance whether the store could refrigerate the cake first. The store was kindly stated that it was possible. Then I went to the store to celebrate the birthday after mealing with my friends. Only a little hard to stop the clerk.The bartending is not bad. The Shouxing had a Shot entertainment activity in the month. Asked whether the clerk could take a photo for us, the clerk was also very willing and kind."
一個不小心還了個島，酒單說明很有特色很幽默，鹹派燉飯都有在水準以上，炸虱目魚柳很特別，值得嘗試看看。有額外隔出一個吸煙區是很貼心的表現，聖誕節的時候人多到爆，建議要先電話詢問有沒有位子，好像有限時間但可能要再與店家確認！,An accidentally returned is the island. The wine list shows that it is very distinctive and humorous. The salted stewed rice is above the standard. The fried milkfish willow is very special and it is worth trying.There is an additional smoking area that is very intimate. There are many people in Christmas. It is recommended that you first call for a seat. It seems that it may be confirmed with the store!
"價格偏貴，調酒一杯基本$300-$600左右
但非常有特色，也可以感受到他們是真的很用心在設計酒單，比起外面有一些創意酒吧結果進去很問號的好多！
服務生也很專業，如果不知道酒喝起來是什麼口味都可以直接問他
整體消費起來的感受良好，不過依照價位也不太可能會常常去消費
適合朋友想嚐鮮的地方","The price is expensive, a cup of bartending is basically $ 300- $ 600
But very distinctive, you can also feel that they are really designing wine lists. Compared with some creative bars outside, there are a lot of question marks!
The waiter is also very professional. If you do n’t know what the taste is drinking, you can ask him directly
The overall consumption feels good, but it is unlikely to be consumed often according to the price

"很有特色的一間酒吧！
店家有推出台灣系列調酒，共12種。
這次剛好喝完一輪，
個人覺得每一種都相當好喝，菜單上的圖片就跟實物一摸一樣，很適合拍照也很好喝。
調酒裡面都有融合很多台灣水果、茶或酒，
在擺盤上（器具使用）也很用心，煙燻的會蓋盅、杯子也會特別選用有台式風格的碗盅，很可愛也很用心。
店員服務態度也很好，會即時過來幫你點餐。
送錯一杯還直接送給我們😂
食物方面個人很推炸雞塊，調味好肉汁也多👍
很推薦的一間酒吧，乾淨舒適也很漂亮！
很推薦給大家！","A very distinctive bar!
The store has launched the Taiwan series of bartender, with a total of 12 types.
This time just finished a round,
Personally, I think that each one is quite delicious. The picture on the menu is the same as the real thing. It is very suitable for taking pictures and delicious.
There are many combination of Taiwanese fruits, tea or alcohol in the bartender,
On the panel (use of the appliance), it is also very attentive. The smoky can be covered with cups and cups. It will also choose a tablet -style bowl. It is very cute and attentive.
The clerk's service attitude is also very good, and he will come to you to order for you immediately.
Send the wrong cup and give it directly to us 送
In terms of food, I am very frying chicken nuggets, and there are more gravy seasonings.
It is recommended a bar, clean and comfortable!
I recommend it to everyone!"
"該店距離台北火車站很近, R1出口走5分鐘就到了~店位在2樓~

整體裝潢還ok, 比較昏暗的氛圍. 餐點菜單如圖, 選擇算多, 我這次點了
1. 哈密瓜鮭魚佐蜂蜜油醋: 好吃, 甜甜酸酸的, 很爽口, 搭配鮭魚也不會怪
2. 香煎干貝佐熱帶水果油醋: 好吃, 干貝很新鮮, 一樣爽口
3. 水蓮義大利麵: 挺特別的, 味道也很好, 蛤蠣很新鮮
4. 無酒精調酒: 店員會依照你的喜好去微調, 我個人不喜歡甜, 然後選擇茶品類, 最後很滿意店家的特調~

整體體驗是好的, 店員態度都不錯, 只是會忘記加水~~需要提醒~~~大概太忙了~~價位中間~~我會願意再次造訪~~

唯一可改進的是室內有煙味.
以上純屬個人經驗分享, 謝謝~~","The store is very close to Taipei Railway Station, and the R1 exports will arrive 5 minutes ~ The store is on the 2nd floor ~

The overall decoration is OK, the dim atmosphere. The meal menu is shown in the figure.
1. Cantaloupe Salmon Salva Said Honey Vinegar: It is delicious, sweet and sour, very refreshing, and it will not blame with salmon
2. Dry -fried dried shells of tropical fruit vinegar: delicious, shellfish is very fresh, just as refreshing
3. Water Lotus Italian Noodles: quite special, the taste is also very good, the oysters are fresh
4. Wineless alcohol: The clerk will fine -tune according to your preference. I personally don't like sweetness, and then choose tea category. Finally, I am very satisfied with the special adjustment of the store ~

The overall experience is good, the clerk's attitude is good, but you will forget to add water ~~ You need to remind ~~~ probably too busy ~~ The price is in the middle ~~ I will be willing to visit again ~~

The only thing that can be improved is the smell of smoke in the room.
The above is pure personal experience sharing, thank you ~~"
"食物真的5顆星好吃沒話說
酒也很特別也調的非常好喝
只不過整體店家給客人的感覺不是很好
限時三小時或許是店家的明文規定但是時間一到就瘋狂催促，更何況店內還有許多空位，還聽到疑似是老闆的人時間一到就叫工讀生來趕人，讓人感覺很不好。
或許適合你只想最多聊三小時剛剛好的人一起來，如果你是來放縱的那真的去別家比較適合。","Food is really 5 stars delicious
The wine is also very special and very delicious
It's just that the overall store feels good to the guests
Three hours of a limited time may be the explicit regulations of the store, but the time is rushing crazy, not to mention that there are still many vacancy in the store. I also hear that the person who is suspected of being a boss is coming to drive people to catch people. It makes people feel bad.
Maybe you just want to talk about people who are just right for three hours. If you are here to indulge, it is more suitable to go to other houses."
"今晚放的音樂有兩首先知瑪莉、一首Lücy跟一首壞特，直接從四顆星加到五顆星。

干貝松露燉飯的干貝過熟到還以為是雞肉呢！撇除這個燉飯跟義大利麵的飯體跟麵體處理都剛好，混合的醬汁稠度也沒得挑惕。
鹹酥雞真的很像叫外送的…","There are two programs, Mary, a Lücy and a bad special tonight, adding four stars to five stars.

"食物還可
酒的設計很有特色，味道就還好，酒精濃度夠酒感也藏的不錯，但味道就稍嫌沒有層次直接到底，也沒有什麼尾韻。適合但外國朋友來訪，或是不是特別熟的朋友聚餐。

東西很好吃份量比較少一點，第一個是有酒的義大利麵這樣擺盤真的很特別，要不要➕都可以，我把它加進去吃起來有濃烈的酒香混合奶油。調酒也都很好喝，可以來一趟環島之旅。,"Things are very delicious. The first is that the pasta with wine is really special. If you want it, you can add it to a strong wine mixed cream.The bartending is also very delicious, you can come to the tour around the island."
主打有特色的台灣水果調酒，也有一般常見的調酒，同桌共點了八款都蠻好喝的，適合約朋友聚聚。（酒較厚，不太能喝的點一杯即可）,"There are special Taiwan fruits and alcohol, and there are common alcohol. The same table at the same table is pretty delicious, and it is suitable for friends to get together.(The wine is thicker, you can drink a glass of drinking)"

"酒類都非常順口好喝 九宮格意外的好喝 除了高粱的那杯比較不能接受 其他都喝不夠啊🤣希望可以出單點品項
是一間很適合慢慢喝的酒吧
可能客人沒有很多 所以店裡不會很吵 但也不會安靜到令人尷尬 整理環境很舒服
店員也很親切的介紹
建議來之前要先訂位
上次沒訂位撲空 這次很幸運的有位子🥰","The alcohol is very smooth and delicious. Nine palaces are unexpectedly delicious. Except for the sorghum cup, it is not enough to accept other drinking.
It is a bar that is very suitable for drinking slowly
Maybe there are not many guests, so the shop will not be very noisy, but it will not be quiet enough to make the environment comfortable. The environment is very comfortable.
The clerk is also very kindly introduced
It is recommended to reservation before coming
Last time, I did n’t make a place. I ’m lucky this time."
內用沒客滿就不會趕人，會主動關心調酒合不合口味，有想調整的地方也會積極協助，酒單上沒想喝的話，也會親切地討論了解喜好後客製化。店內氣氛頗好～,"If you do n’t have full, you wo n’t catch people. You will take the initiative to care about the unpopular taste of the bartender. If you want to adjust, you will also actively assist. If you do n’t want to drink on the wine list, you will also cordially discuss and understand the customization of your preferences.The atmosphere in the store is quite good ~"
"具有創意與文化，非常好喝的調酒！
可以揪朋友一起來環島咖啡，也有歷史脈絡的台灣歷史調酒，從時間與空間的維度發想，都很有趣，好喝好拍。
餐點部分也超好吃，特別是三杯雞義大利麵，fusion的做法，光是端上來的香氣就垂涎三尺了。","Creative and culture, very delicious bartending!
You can come to the coffee around the island together. There are also historical alcoholic bartender with historical contexts. From time to time and space dimension, it is very interesting.

"台灣味滿滿的Bar！翻開menu裡面滿滿的都寫著使用來自台灣不同地方材料的調酒，連下酒菜都是在台灣人氣很高的鹽酥雞等等的台灣在地小吃！除了享受bar放鬆的感覺，也可以一併嚐遍台灣各地的食材

"台灣調酒很有特色~
但是菌菇燉飯的飯真的有點太生。雖然他是想要讓醬入味，但還需要加強。
鹽酥雞很好吃，可是很油喔！
一直會聞到煙味！
本店沒有插座喔！","Taiwan bartender is very distinctive ~
But the rice mushroom stewed rice is really a bit too.Although he wants to make the sauce taste, he needs to strengthen it.
The salt crispy chicken is delicious, but it is very oily!
I always smell the smell of smoke!
There is no socket in this shop!"
"第一次來到soshow，整體空間還算不錯，燈光設計和入口樓梯的寬敞，給人很不一樣的感覺，有吸菸室安排在戶外，對於需要的朋友不需要下去一樓，很方便

店家主推台灣特色調酒，很用心的設計各種酒譜。拉拉山調酒，有孔雀開屏式的蘋果片展現刀工，旁邊點上真實肉桂，讓香氣煙霧瀰漫，最後把搭配蘋果和伏特加調酒，喝起來真的身心靈都是一種享受，給予高度評價。

店內有一些下酒菜可以搭配，這部分味道上也都還不錯，但相對酒譜特色，排在第二位。晚上七點多人少時還蠻安靜的，夜晚人多時，變的比較熱鬧，談話分貝必需提高。

啤酒部分有臺虎精釀，大麥、小麥、ipa搭配品脫杯，也可以試試， 下次如果杯子有冰會更好。","The first time I came to Soshow, the overall space was pretty good. The light design and the spacious of the entrance stairs gave people a very different feeling. There are smoking rooms arranged outdoors.

The owner of the store pushed Taiwan's specialty bartending, and designed various winemates very carefully.Lala Mountain bartender, there is a peacock -based apple film to show the knife. The real cinnamon is on the side to make the aroma smoke permeate. Finally, the apple and vodka bartender. High comments.

There are some wines in the store to match, and this part of the taste is also good, but it is ranked second than the characteristics of the winebook.At 7 o'clock in the evening, people were quite quiet when they were young. For a long time at night, they became more lively, and the decibels must be improved.

The beer parts include tiger crafts. Barley, wheat, and IPA parts off the cup. You can also try it. The next time the cup has ice, it will be better."
"被酒水耽誤的鹽酥雞店，超好吃⋯
當然前者也都還不錯，服務很好很貼心，知道我們這桌有人不喝酒還特地把酒換成汽水🥹","The salt crispy chicken shop delayed by wine, super delicious ...
Of course, the former is also good, the service is very good and intimate, knowing that someone at this table does not drink, but also replaced the wine into soda."
"環島旅行跟時光旅行是店內特色調酒系列，眼花撩亂的不知道該點哪一個？店員會介紹並詢問調酒偏好茶香或果香？清爽還是重口味？所以不知道要點什麼，不妨請店員介紹推薦。
最後點了苗栗森之華跟桃園拉拉山蜜桃之戀，都是果香系列調酒，很清爽好喝。另外餐點部分也都好好吃，跟調酒很搭。跟朋友小酌聊天的好地方，可以從傍晚坐到半夜，店內氣氛很舒適，不過偶爾陽台門開關，還是會有一些煙味飄進來。","Time travel and time travel is a specialty bartending series in the store. I don't know which point should I order?Will the clerk introduce and inquire about bartending preference for tea or fruity?Refreshing or heavy flavor?So I do n’t know what to order, please ask the clerk to introduce.
Finally, I ordered the love of Miaolisen's Hua and Taoyuan Lala Mountain Peach. They are all fruity series of bartender, which is very refreshing and delicious.In addition, the meal part is also delicious, and it is very good at bartending.You can chat with friends to chat with friends. You can sit in the evening to the middle of the night. The atmosphere in the shop is very comfortable, but occasionally, there will still be some smoke smells in the balcony door switch."
台灣在的特色的調酒值得一試，台北手紙個人最喜歡，茶香跟酒調和的非常好，大甲芋頭較為普通，芋頭味跟原本預想的落差較大，另外酒香炒飯跟鹹酥雞都很好吃又下酒,The characteristic of Taiwan's characteristics is worth trying. Taipei hand paper personally favorite. Tea fragrance is very good with alcohol. Big arm taro is more ordinary. The taro taste is large from the original expected. In addition They are all delicious and wine

"非常棒的一家店。店員對於酒的類型以及歷史具有豐富的知識。此外，兩位bartender很熱情、好聊。讓人有在家裡跟熟識朋友喝酒的感覺。

非常推薦醉陸羽的九宮格。建議讓bartender發揮創意，利用不同的茶、水果來做出好喝的shot。另外我很喜歡「嘉義」。雖然酒精濃度較高（35%），但非常順口。

總結來說，是我在台北少數遇到cp 值極高的店家。bartender顏值也很高呢！","A great shop.The clerk has rich knowledge about the type of wine and history.In addition, the two Bartender are very enthusiastic and good.It makes people feel like drinking friends at home.

It is very recommended to be drunk Lu Yu's Jiugongge.It is recommended that Bartender played creativity and use different tea and fruits to make delicious Shot.In addition, I like ""Chiayi"" very much.Although alcohol concentration is high (35%), it is very smooth.

In summary, it is one of the few shops in Taipei who encountered a very high CP value.Bartender has a high face value!"
適合所有人去的舒適空間(認真強調)，酒類超級有創意完全刷新我的想像、而且很「臺灣」，與六位友人點了很多道主餐，分食一輪確定全部都非常好吃！！！偏少的份量就是要多點一些小菜來吃，我個人很愛酒豆腐(來不及拍照就吃完了)。有低消一人五百，約六七百元左右就可以吃得很飽足，服務人員很棒很專業，豬豬胸章服務生謝謝你！喝不喝酒都一樣開心！,"The comfort space suitable for everyone (carefully emphasized), the wine is super creative completely refreshed my imagination, and it is very ""Taiwan"".

調酒很不錯、又漂亮好看！松露薯條也很好吃！但美中不足的是店員感覺人手很不足，一直忙不過來、點餐上酒都有落漆⋯⋯老闆請加油。,"The bartender is very good, beautiful and beautiful!Tulu potato strips are also delicious!But the disadvantage of the United States is that the clerk feels that the person is very lacking. He can't be busy, and the wine is painted. The boss please cheer."
"價格中高。

調酒很有特色，每一款都有不錯的主題，高雄乃姬是款女生會很愛的調酒。

松露雞肉燉飯很好吃，小點也還不錯略鹹，台灣鹹酥雞還用個袋子裝飾實在很三八。

週末人很多，需要訂位，而且限時用餐3小時。","The price is high.

Blooming is very distinctive. Each one has a good theme. Kaohsiung Naiji is a bartender that girls will love.

Tulu chicken stewed rice is delicious, and the little bit is also slightly salty. Taiwan's salty crispy chicken is also decorated with a bag.

There are a lot of people on weekends, you need to order, and you can eat for 3 hours in a limited time."
非常喜歡這邊的氣氛。 酒雖然有點小貴，但非常有特色，是以台灣的地區特色已經國外的幾個國家命名酒，裝的容器也非常有感覺，酒的味道也很好，很喜歡。食物也很好吃，已經帶來不同的朋友去過幾次，很適合朋友一起來輕輕鬆鬆的聊天。平日晚上也滿多人去的，所以建議要先訂位。酒的種類算多，加上各種特色酒名，很想每種都點點看，試試看味道。,"I like the atmosphere here very much.Although the wine is a bit expensive, it is very distinctive. It is named wine in several countries abroad in the regional characteristics of Taiwan. The container is also very sensible. The taste of the wine is also very good.

I have brought different friends several times, and it is very suitable for friends to chat easily together.There are many people going on weekdays, so it is recommended to order first.There are many types of wine, and the names of various specialty wines, I really want to see each one, try to see the taste."
氣氛很好，酒的視覺效果不錯，焗烤玉米片非常好吃，其他熱食就中規中矩普普通通，酒比較偏甜偏少女一些，不錯的酒吧,"The atmosphere is very good, the visual effects of the wine are good, the grilled corn slices are very delicious, and other hot foods are normal and ordinary. The wine is relatively sweet and the girl."
"20181212 一訪
餐食的水準算是我目前去過酒吧中算中上
三杯雞義大麵中西合併，吃起來口味滿特別但不會難吃，但因為會辣，我吃的是塔香松阪豬炒烏龍麵，味道不錯，有入味我就覺得難得惹，台灣的炒烏龍很多都爆雷，酒的部分環島口味中我選了平常店較少的蓮花，的確是滿清爽的口感，但其實沒什麼酒感，所以喜歡雞尾酒的應該蠻適合，另外一杯金門一拾算是酒味比較濃，剛好當天有調酒冠軍的調酒師，朋友點了我還是覺得像果汁，不過朋友是說有層次感
有機會去的話可能要問一下比較有酒味😂","20181212 visit
The level of meals is considered to be in the bar in the bar.
The three cups of chicken sides of the pastry are merged with Chinese and Western. The taste is full of taste but not unpalatable, but because it will be spicy, I eat taosamisa pig fried oolong noodles. The taste is good. Many of the fried oolong burst thunder. In the flavor of the wine around the island, I chose a lotus flower with fewer ordinary shops. It is indeed a refreshing taste, but there is no wine feeling, so those who like cocktails should be quite suitable. It is considered a strong taste. It happened that there was a bartender who was the bartender champion that day. My friend ordered it. I still feel like fruit juice, but my friend said that there is a sense of layering.
If you have a chance to go"
"食物不錯，但酒類自己喝不太習慣
服務缺少熱情，詢問酒是用什麼調的有什麼味道風格，獲得了「後面有寫」
室內空調有點悶，個人感覺食物比較是強項","The food is good, but the wine is not used to drinking it yourself
The service lacks enthusiasm. Ask what the taste of the wine is used, and the style of the wine is used.
The indoor air conditioner is a bit stuffy, and I personally feel that food is a strong point"
"已經三訪了
調酒很有創意 酒不會太淡
酒杯也有精心挑選過

店員熱情 酒也好喝 很用心的一家店 已經回訪很多次！這次帶朋友來 朋友也一致好評🤩聊天聚會小酌的好場所,A shop with enthusiastic wine and a good intention has returned many times!This time I bring friends to friends and praise the good places for chatting party
"一陣子沒去，近期前往發現菜單跟menu 有調整，但主打調酒的品項依然很有台灣特色（女生應該會比較喜歡這系列）。
造訪當日的playlist 是一系列80-90年代的華語歌，比起當晚喝的酒，歌單更讓人醉心。","I haven't gone for a while. I recently went to find that the menu has been adjusted with Menu, but the item of the main wine adjustment still has Taiwanese characteristics (girls should prefer this series).
PlayList, which visited the day, was a series of Chinese songs in the 1980s and 1990s. The song list was more intoxicating than the wine that night."
"這裡的酒很有特色～
不同的地方有符合當地獨特的調酒
我們點了金門、二林、高雄
調酒整體偏甜 但是味道都很不錯
然後我們還被招待一杯二林因為bartender好像不小心多調一杯😂","The wine here is very distinctive ~
Different places are in line with local unique bartender
We ordered Kinmen, Erlin, Kaohsiung
The overall bartender is sweet but the taste is very good
Then we were also entertaining a cup of Erlin because Bartender did not be careful to adjust a cup of more"
"很有氣氛的一間酒吧！
主打的應該是台灣特色調酒～
當天喝的是台東，杯子很特別酒還好，但是後來送的shot超好喝👍
因為有低消，另外還點了義大利麵，也蠻好吃的！

雖然東西好吃氣氛好，但有限時間，另外一人低消500，如果是自己ok，聚餐可能會在考慮考慮！","A very atmospheric bar!
The main thing should be Taiwan's specialty bartender ~
It was Taitung that day. The cup was very good, but the shorter you sent later 👍
Because there is a low disappearance, it also ordered the pasta, which is also delicious!

Although the things are delicious, but a limited time, the other person eliminates 500 low. If it is OK, the dinner may be considered!"
水果調酒都不錯喝，喝起來清爽，酒精感不會很重。松露薯條好吃。起司條普通。可惜環境超級吵雜，客人素質略低，現場彷彿夜店，絕對不會想再二訪。,"Fruit alcohol is good to drink, drink refreshing, and alcohol will not be very heavy.Todgeflains are delicious.The cheese bar is ordinary.Unfortunately, the environment is super noisy, and the quality of the guests is slightly lower. The scene is like a nightclub, and I will never want to visit again."
酒都好喝，吃的也不錯，店內氣氛很好，還有魔術師做表演（很Q）,"The wine is delicious, and it is good to eat. The atmosphere in the store is very good, and the magician performs performance (very Q)"
"服務很好並客氣專業，用心推廣臺灣歷史文化，菜單用心且專業，如同在博物館般的介紹有創意的臺灣史和地方特色。

菜色口味雖不是驚艷型的好吃，不過沒什麼雷算中上，調酒稍嫌清淡沒什麼酒味，對以喝酒為目的的客人，可能有點遺憾像臺灣地方特色飲品，絕對不可能醉。簡單來說這個地方就是放鬆的地方，期待有態度質感的酒類，可能會有一點小失望，適合下班放鬆的小酌一下。

如果只是以整體氣氛和推廣臺灣而言，絕對是值得推薦並有特色的店家。","The service is very good and polite, promoting Taiwan's history and culture with intention, the menu is carefully and professional, like an creative Taiwanese history and local characteristics like a museum.

Although the taste of the dish is not amazing and delicious, there is no thunderous calculation. The bartending is slightly light and there is no wine. For guests who are drinking for drinking, it may be a bit regrettable to be like a specialty drink in Taiwan. It is absolutely impossible to get drunk.In simple terms, this place is a relaxed place. I look forward to the alcohol with attitude and texture. There may be a little disappointment, which is suitable for relaxation of get off work.

If it is only for the overall atmosphere and promotion of Taiwan, it is definitely a recommended and unique shop."
"導航雖說北車2號出口出門 但其實現在在維修 沒辦法從那出來
從中山站出口過去反而更快（須經過地下街），也不用經過暗暗的路（如圖是從北車走可能要經過的暗暗巷子）

然後餐點算中上 豬肉處理的表皮酥香
但最驚豔的是哈密瓜煙燻鮭魚 超！好！吃！！！大推推！
而且當天的調酒很順口 清甜但不會有糖漿味 同行者說裡面好像有威士忌？（未求證）
（而且很幸運的是店家贈送！）","Although navigation is exported to the 2nd car, in fact, there is no way to come out from the maintenance
In the past, the exit of Zhongshan Station was faster (the underground street must be passed), and there is no need to pass the road (as shown in the dark alley that may pass from the north car)

Then the epidermis of pork treatment is crispy
But the most amazing thing is that cantaloupe smoked salmon super!good!eat!IntersectionIntersectionPush!
And the bartender that day is very sweet, but there will be no syrup. Candids say that there seems to be whiskey in it?(No verification)
(And fortunately, the store presented!)"
下午時段人較少，一群朋友來聚聚很適合，氣氛愜意空間開闊，老闆&店員介紹專業，酒單精美但還是會難以選擇，會再來嚐鮮！,"There are fewer people during the afternoon, and a group of friends come together for gathering. The atmosphere is open and wide."
"店員非常優秀！
餐點非常好吃👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
如果星星沒有限制，我會給100顆星！","The clerk is very good!
The meal is very delicious 非常
If the stars are not limited, I will give 100 stars!"
"戴眼鏡的服務生超讚讚(拍謝我不知道你的名字)
有機會會再去ㄉ
啊也很感謝給我們很I的位子
btw我是E 的那個好好笑","The waiter wearing glasses is super praised (thanks I don't know your name)
If you have a chance, you will go again
Ah, thank you very much for giving us a very i seat
btw I am the funny of e"
"是餐廳也是酒吧，低消500元，吃個晚餐再搭配一杯調酒剛剛好，而且沒有服務費！
宵夜時間沒有嚴格規定低消，和朋友一人一杯酒，再點了一份炸物。
覺得這裡的酒很特別，選擇也很多，有環島系列跟歷史系列，也有一般的調酒。
我們點了二林和台南柚飄香，二林喝起來很順，是女生會喜歡的酒，聽說也是熱門款！有點玫瑰水果酒的感覺！柚飄香酒味就比較重一點，一開始有柚子的香味，後面就會有後勁上來。
甜酒醬雞塊的醬很不錯！吃起來比較不會感覺油膩。
這間酒吧的氣氛很不錯，座位也滿舒適，適合跟朋友下班小酌一杯、聊天的地方，有機會還會想再來！","It is also a restaurant and a bar. It is 500 yuan low. It is just right to eat a cup of sober, and there is no service fee!
There is no strict regulation of the supper time, a glass of wine with friends, and ordering another fried object.
I think the wine here is very special, there are also many choices, there are rounds of Island series and historical series, as well as general bartending.
We ordered Erlin and Tainan Pomelo Fragrance. Erlin was very smooth. It was a wine that girls would like. I heard that it is also a popular model!A bit of rose fruit wine!The flavor of grapefree fragrance is a bit heavy. At the beginning, there is the aroma of grapefruit, and there will be a stamina afterwards.
The sauce of sweet wine sauce chicken pieces is very good!It doesn't feel greasy to eat.
The atmosphere of this bar is very good, and the seats are full of comfort. It is suitable for a drink with friends to have a drink and chat. If you have a chance, you will want to come again!"
"舒服適合跟朋友小聚的地方
平日沒有時間限制
女服務生很用心介紹餐點
調酒餐點都很好吃，可以請服務生推薦適合的口味","Comfortable for places where you gather with friends
There is no time limit on weekdays
The female waiter introduces meals with my heart
The bartender meals are delicious, you can ask the waiter to recommend the right flavor"
"鹹酥雞超級好吃一定要點！
酒的部分超推剝皮辣椒很特別
銀絲卷中規中矩","The salty crispy chicken is super delicious!
The wine part of the wine is very special
Silver silk roll medium -sized medium"
"位在中山北路上二樓的SoShow，融合了台灣各地的特色與素材的調酒，不止兼具了味覺與視覺的享受之外還多了一些驚喜的感覺～這次點了三杯調酒：台南-蓮花、拉拉山-水蜜桃之戀，還有台東-洛神。台南-蓮花在杯腳裝飾了一小片蓮藕乾讓人會心一笑，味道上清香爽口，文旦的柑橘味道讓整體的平衡提升了不少。拉拉山端上來時也是讓人眼睛為之一亮！一小截燃燒的肉桂帶來些許暖暖的香氣，視覺效果沒話說，也不會過份浮誇。

食物的選擇也很多，點的薯條、蕃茄cheeze、炸雞軟骨口味也都不錯～

整體而言，這次點的幾杯調酒易飲性都極高，也會讓人想再去試試看其他的幾種。","Soshow, located on the second floor of Zhongshan North Road, combines the bartending of the characteristics and material of all parts of Taiwan. It also feels more surprising in addition to the taste and visual enjoyment of taste and visual enjoyment ~ This time I ordered three cups of bartending: Tainan-Lotus, Lala Mountain-Peach Love, and Taitung-Luo Shen.Tainan-Lotus decorated a small lotus root in the cup, which makes people laugh, and the taste is refreshing. Wen Dan's citrus flavor has raised the overall balance a lot.When the Lala Mountain came up, it also made people's eyes bright!A small cinnamon brings a little warm aroma. The visual effect is nothing to say, and it will not exaggerate.

There are also a lot of food selection, and the flavors of fries, tomatoes cheatze, and fried chicken cartilage are also good ~

On the whole, several cups of bartending at this time are extremely high, and it will also make people want to try to see other types."
"氣氛很棒，東西也好吃~
價格算中等微偏上一點
會再訪","The atmosphere is great, and things are delicious ~
The price is medium slightly slightly more upper than

我也會常常去😂😂😂 …","Bartender is super good, the wine is 100 points, the atmosphere in the store is good, the boss is also very good, and the things are super delicious. Unfortunately, you can only evaluate 5 stars!

"以地方元素為出發點的的特色調酒，味道都非常好。

"少數的五星.

爬完象山朋友介紹去吃飯喝酒
價位對於學生來說確實偏高，但真的很有價值

奶油燉飯，當晚爬完山真的很餓，想說就吃個飯看看，結果一吃真的覺得hen棒；燉飯的黏稠度拿捏的很剛好，配上半熟水波蛋的蛋黃液，點了一個分時當下朋友都覺得全場最亮點

酒的部分，Sex on the Beach我很喜歡酒味沒有很重，柳橙味很足，至於另外兩杯是朋友點台灣地圖的品項，一個是拉拉山一個好像是桑葚的

拉拉山的是我第二喜歡的，桑葚可能味道真的不合我意吧XD

店面環境，標準的酒吧吵雜，大家的聊天聲雜在一起其實晚上大家聚餐真的還蠻有感的","A few five stars.

After climbing Xiangshan, I introduced to dinner and drinking
The price is really high for students, but it is really valuable

Cream -stewed rice, I was really hungry after climbing the mountain that night. I would like to eat a meal if I wanted to say. As a result, I really felt heen was great. I ordered the time when I ordered the time.

In the wine part, Sex On the Beach I like the taste of the wine is not very heavy, and the orange taste is sufficient. As for the other two cups are the items of the Taiwanese map, one is Lala Mountain and the other seems to be mulberry.

Lala Mountain is my second favorite, mulberry may taste really disagreement, let me XD

The store environment, standard bars are noisy, and everyone’s chat sounds are mixed together. In fact, everyone really feels like a meal at night"
"每次來都有不一樣的驚喜 😄

今天（110.10.25）點的是台北手紙（上次喝應該是去年的事了，相較於去年，今天喝起來完全沒有喝出茶酒味，只喝出水果的清爽及酸甜，就我個人而言，我比較喜歡茶酒味，所以這杯今天表現令我失望）、台南柚飄香（這杯果味跟酒味比例非常完美，柚香在酒的催化下更顯得豐富有層次）、台東洛神賦-禪（喝起來就像洛神花酒，有著濃濃的洛神花酸，酒味也很凜冽，但是兩者相較，洛神花酸略勝一籌）、苗栗森之華（清爽的香茅味，帶著淡淡的酒味，不過香茅味道滿特殊的，不會刺但，但我個人就是不愛）、紹興雞蛋豆腐（非常好吃！都不知道這兩個東西這麼搭，以後自己在要嘗試看看！）、嫩煎厚切牛舌佐桂花紅酒醬（牛舌應該有先滷過，吃起來有股淡淡滷味，味道很棒，口感很紮實很好，不管是直接吃還是沾醬都很好吃！）。,"Today (110.10.25) is the Taipei hand paper (last time it should be a matter of last year. Compared with last year, I did n’t drink the taste of tea wine at all today. Personally, I prefer the taste of tea and wine, so this cup is disappointed today), Tainan Pomelo Fragrance (this cup of fruit flavor and wine flavor is perfect, and the grapefree fragrance is more layered under the catalysis of wine) , Taitung Luoshen Fu-Zen (drinking like a Luoshen flower wine, has a strong Luoshen flower acid, the wine taste is also very sore, but compared to the two, Luoshen flowers are slightly better), Miaolisen's Hua (refreshing China (refreshing The flavor of lemongrass, with a touch of wine, but the flavor of lemongrass is special and won't be stabbing, but I personally don't love it), Shaoxing egg tofu (very delicious! I don’t know these two things like this way like this. In the future, you are trying to see it!), Nen frozen tongue tongue osmanthus and red wine sauce (beef tongue should have been marinated first, it tastes a fade, the taste is great, the taste is very good, whether it is directly, whether it is directly Eating or dipping sauce is delicious!)."
整體氣氛很歡樂，麵類跟炸物都在水準之上，不知道想喝什麼調酒的可以試試看環島，每杯調酒都可以喝出各縣市的特色，造型更是一大亮點，要酒感要甜要酸皆可體驗到，看得出店家的用心，非常值得再訪！,The overall atmosphere is very happy. The noodles and fried objects are above the standard. I do n’t know what to drink to drink. You can try the island. You can drink the characteristics of each county and cities. The shape is a highlight. You can experience the feeling of wine and sourness. You can see that the intention of the store is worth visiting!
"二樓空間約莫十桌，有戶外吸煙區
酒品點的是”日本”，有濃濃的芝麻香味加上杯緣的花生粉、黑糖粉很有記憶點，很推薦烤物玉米片，炸物鹽酥雞必點單品👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 …","The space on the second floor is about ten tables, and there are outdoor smoking areas
The wine is ""Japan"". It has a strong sesame flavor and a cup of peanut powder and brown sugar powder. It is very memorable. It is recommended to roast corn slices. 👍🏻 👍🏻 ..."
融合台灣歷史、特色的酒，服務生也很會推薦，會再訪的店。,"Wine that integrates Taiwan's history and characteristics, the waiters are also recommended, and they will visit again."
價格合理又有台灣特色，很舒服的空間，氣氛到位，餐點好吃，調酒味道很棒。很適合找朋友一起來聚聚。,"The price is reasonable and has the characteristics of Taiwan. It is very comfortable, the atmosphere is in place, the meal is delicious, and the sombering taste is great.Very suitable for friends to gather together."
"附近不好停車，建議搭乘捷運前往，
喝酒不開車，開車不喝酒。

假日低消500，一杯酒大概300多，
食物的部分也300多，

座位區寬敞，螢幕上會播放運動賽事，
愛好運動或者有大比賽的話很適合來小酌，
燈光比起其他酒吧來說是很明亮的，
有規劃戶外吸煙區，這點給個推
抽煙跟不抽菸的人可以互相尊重，

酒的話蠻多種類，不知怎麼點可以請服務生推薦
基本上都不會雷，蠻安全的，
每個人應該都能找到能接受的酒

食物的部分 .. 其實真的蠻普通的，
比照價格來說CP值偏低，
建議來小酌就好，

如果一晚會喝超過三倍的話，
這間的cp值就有點低了，
可以考慮其他酒吧

假日限制時數為三個小時，平日不知道有沒有
可以線上訂位，這點很方便，給個推
也跟Funnow有合作，想去的人可以參考看看

對了，酒吧在二樓，沒有很明顯的招牌
來訪者建議稍微對一下門牌號碼，
沒注意的話蠻容易走過頭的，
樓梯不算太友善好走，
洗手間很乾淨，店員都蠻酷的，

總結是可以三五好友來小酌，
如果要吃飯跟豪飲可以再考慮看看！","It's not good to park nearby, it is recommended to take the MRT,
Drink without driving, driving without drinking.

Holiday low 500, a glass of wine is about 300,
The food part is also more than 300,

The seat area is spacious, and sports events will be played on the screen.
If you love sports or have big competitions, it is very suitable for drinking,
The light is brighter than other bars,
There are planning outdoor smoking areas, this is a push
Those who smoke and smoke can respect each other,

There are many types of wine. I don’t know how to ask the waiter to recommend it
Basically it will not be thunder, it is quite safe,
Everyone should be able to find acceptable wines they can accept

The food part .. In fact, it is really ordinary,
Compared to the price, the CP value is low,
It is recommended to have a drink,

If you drink more than three times a night,
The CP value of this room is a bit low,
You can consider other bars

The number of holiday restrictions is three hours, and I don’t know if there is any
You can order online, which is very convenient, give me a push
Also cooperate with Funnow, those who want to go can refer to it

Visitors suggest a little bit of the house number,
If you don’t pay attention, it is easy to walk through your head,
The stairs are not too friendly to leave,
The bathroom is very clean, the clerk is quite cool,

The summary is that you can drink three or five friends,
If you want to eat and drink, you can consider it again!"
酒好喝～很有特色，不過值得一提的是危機處理很及時！ 有個bartender 好像是受傷吧？現場其他的內外場人員有即時處理，其他顧客也滿能理解的，也沒覺得上酒時間有比較久，蠻好的,"The wine is good ~ very distinctive, but it is worth mentioning that the crisis treatment is very timely!There is a Bartender who seems to be injured?Other internal and external field personnel at the scene have been dealt with immediately, and other customers are full of understanding, and I don’t think it ’s a long time for drinking."
"週五跟朋友去喝了幾杯
其中友人點了杯噤聲系列的四季紅
因不喜歡桂花味道而覺得普普
因此我們交換了彼此的調酒
只能說
必須幫當天的調酒師平反一下
因為我覺得超好喝
味道就如同調酒師介紹的那樣
是可以明顯感受到的
下次去還會再點這杯","I went to drink a few cups with my friends on Friday
Among them, my friends ordered the four seasons of the cup sound series
I feel Pop because I don’t like osmanthus flavor
So we exchanged alcohol of each other
Can only say
You must help the bartender on the day to rehabilitate
Because I think it's so delicious
The taste is just like the bartender introduced
It can be clearly felt
I will order this cup again next time"
"把台灣各城市特色呈現在調酒中🍹用調酒來環島🇹🇼

不錯，店員親和，酒好喝，環境舒適，酒單是有特色的，不是一般的無聊酒吧～,"Yes, the clerk is affinity, the wine is good, the environment is comfortable, the wine list is distinctive, it is not an ordinary boring bar ~"
各種融入台灣特色的調酒很特別，整體的氛圍還算不錯，可惜服務生介紹不出酒單上的種類，若沒接觸過的酒種只能自己點看看碰碰運氣,"The bartender that integrates into Taiwan's characteristics is very special, and the overall atmosphere is pretty good. Unfortunately, the waiter can not introduce the types of wine lists. If you have not touched the wine species, you can just order it yourself to see your luck."
整間店都很有特色，調酒概念是環島一圈，非常酷，且使用當區材料做出特色調酒、重點是又很好喝，令人驚艷，食物很好吃，整個空間座位表現出放鬆不擁擠的感覺，環境乾淨整潔，店員有禮，會再訪。,"The whole store is very distinctive. The concept of bartending is a circle of around the island, which is very cool. It uses the materials of the area to make special bartending. The focus is that it is delicious. The food is delicious. The entire space seat performance The feeling of relaxation is not crowded, the environment is clean and tidy, the clerk is polite, and he will visit again."
這是無意間發現很適合放空自己腦袋的卻不會掏空口袋的地方，用台灣地名為調酒命名的創意很不錯👍 …,This is a place where it is very suitable for being short of pockets that are very suitable for being empty.
"交通方便，餐點好吃又可以小酌的好地方，適合朋友聚餐。

假日有低消1人650元，這裡有特別不一樣的環島旅行台灣各地特調酒，濃度在25%左右，適合想要小酌的朋友。","It is convenient for transportation, a good place for meals and drinking, suitable for friends to dinner.

會趕人，時間還有半小時多就來催收款。妹酒多，冷氣不冷。個人覺得還好，同類型更喜歡Geography bar比較有人情味，不會想再來。,"Will catch people, and the time is more than half an hour to collect funds.There are too many girls, and air -conditioning is not cold.Personally, I think it ’s okay. The same type prefers Geography Bar more humane and does n’t want to come again."
貴妃乃姬荔枝味很香但對我來說偏甜，柚香把各種元素協調的很完美👍 會想回訪試試其他不同的調酒 …,"The concubine Nai Ji lychee flavor is very fragrant, but it is sweet for me. Pomelo fragrance coordinates all kinds of elements."
"空間寬敞，假日低消一人500，三小時
不會過於昏暗吵雜，食物跟酒也很有水準
是可以跟朋友約喝酒聚餐的好地方","The space is spacious.

I could n’t drink it at all the cups like the potion, and my friends could n’t drink it. Please ask the waiter to take care of where there is a problem, and push it carefully."

"我想一大早喝一杯雞尾酒，所以我就去了那裡，因為它就在步行距離之內。
晚上 7:00 左右單人入住，無需預訂。

我上了二樓，在店裡環視了一圈，說實話，我不太喜歡這裡的氣氛，所以我想過回家，但我還是決定只是喝一杯。
顧名思義，這也是一家餐廳，所以團體和情侶在那裡用餐很開心。

我一看菜單，有很多看起來很美味的雞尾酒！這些雞尾酒的靈感來自台灣的各個地區，對我來說在旅行時是一個非常有趣的菜單項目。
想來想去，我第一口決定喝宜蘭雞尾酒。我已經有一段時間沒有喝過泡沫雞尾酒了！易飲，適合第一口喝，搭配乾果也很適合！可口的！我很高興我不用回家。
我正在考慮第二杯該喝什麼，但我太累了，只能喝一杯。令人失望。 。

當我在櫃檯看一本日文書籍時，調酒師用日文對我說話。我很驚訝台灣有這麼多人會說日文。他還給了我們一些台北的建議。
如果有機會再去台北，我想嚐嚐其他當地的雞尾酒。","I want to drink a cup of cocktail early in the morning, so I went there because it was within the walking distance.
Single -person staying around 7:00 in the evening, no booking is required.

I went to the second floor and looked around in the store. To be honest, I didn't like the atmosphere here, so I thought about going home, but I still decided to just drink a drink.
As the name suggests, this is also a restaurant, so the group and couples are very happy to eat there.

When I looked at the menu, there were many cocktails that looked delicious!These cocktails are inspired by various parts of Taiwan, and it is a very interesting menu project for me for me.
Thinking about it, I decided to drink Yilan cocktail first.I haven't drank a foam cocktail for a while!Easy to drink, suitable for the first bite, it is also suitable for dried fruit!Affordable!I am glad I don't have to go home.
I am thinking about what to drink in the second cup, but I am too tired, I can only drink one cup.Disappointment.Essence

When I read a Chinese book at the counter, the bartender spoke to me in Japanese.I am surprised that there are so many people in Taiwan who can speak Japanese.He also gave us some Taipei suggestions.
If you have a chance to go to Taipei again, I want to taste other local cocktails."
"我來這裡是因為我對台灣水果製成的雞尾酒很感興趣。

有一位會說日語的男店員，我們和他聊了很多事情，玩得很開心🙂‍↕️

雞尾酒也非常美味，非常適合在返回酒店之前喝一杯。
每杯約2000日元。","I came here because I am very interested in cocktails made of Taiwanese fruits.

There is a male clerk who can talk about Japanese, we talked to him a lot of things, and we played very happily 🙂‍↕️

Cocktails are also very delicious, very suitable for drinking a drink before returning to the hotel.
About 2,000 yen per cup."
整體氛圍很好……絕對是一個放鬆的好地方；服務合理且友善。至於食物的味道，我覺得一般般…,"The overall atmosphere is very good ... it is definitely a good place to relax; the service is reasonable and friendly.As for the taste of food, I think it is general ..."
它確實是城裡最好的酒吧之一。地點便利，室內寬敞，採光恰到好處。菜單極其迷人，每款雞尾酒的設計都融入了台灣的食材、元素和文化背景。我渴望帶我的外國朋友來體驗這裡多樣化的美食和飲料。此外，工作人員非常友好和樂於助人！,"It is indeed one of the best bars in the city.The location is convenient, the room is spacious, and the lighting is just right.The menu is extremely charming, and the design of each cocktail is incorporated into Taiwan's ingredients, elements and cultural backgrounds.I want to bring my foreign friends to experience diverse food and drinks here.In addition, the staff is very friendly and helpful!"
"距離台北車站步行約5分鐘的大樓二樓的酒吧。
只有一名工作人員會說日語。
因此，最好坐在櫃檯旁享用。
另外，賓客大多都是台灣人，以年輕人為主。

不過，用台灣食材調製的雞尾酒也有很多種，我想遊客也可以喜歡。
美味的雞尾酒，謝謝您的用餐。","Bar on the second floor of the building about 5 minutes from Taipei Station.
Only one staff member can speak Japanese.
Therefore, it is best to sit next to the counter.
In addition, most guests are Taiwanese, mainly young people.

However, there are many cocktails prepared with Taiwanese ingredients. I think tourists can like it.
Delicious cocktail, thank you for dining."
"毫無疑問是我在馬來西亞和台灣去過的最好的雞尾酒吧。

他們專注於木質（木味）雞尾酒，他們確實將飲料提升到了一個全新的水平。那個味道，那個味道，那個味道，永遠留在你的嘴裡。

我通常不喜歡雞尾酒，但這次例外。

食物也不錯。

最後，他們為我們提供了一款新雞尾酒，他們將在下個月將其列入菜單，天哪，味道也很好。這是完美的木質感。

10/10會再回來。並會推薦任何去台北的人來這裡參觀。","There is no doubt that I have been the best cocktail bar I have visited in Malaysia and Taiwan.

They are focusing on wooden (woody) cocktails, and they do raise drinks to a brand new level.That taste, that taste, and that taste will always stay in your mouth.

I usually don't like cocktails, but this exception.

Food is also good.

In the end, they provided us with a new cocktail. They will include it in the menu next month. Oh my god, it will taste good.This is the perfect wooden texture.

10/10 will come back again.Anyone who goes to Taipei will come here to visit."
這家餐廳是下班後與朋友或同事小酌一杯的好地方。食物很美味，調味也恰到好處。您可以向工作人員詢問熱門菜餚的建議。這裡的雞尾酒都是用台灣當地的食材調製的，非常有特色。這是一個放鬆和社交的好地方。您可以使用信用卡和行動支付。,"This restaurant is a good place to have a drink with friends or colleagues after get off work.The food is delicious and the seasoning is just right.You can ask the staff to ask the hot dishes for advice.The cocktails here are made of local ingredients in Taiwan, which is very distinctive.This is a good place to relax and social.You can use credit cards and mobile payment."
"好吧，我在等我的朋友，所以決定找個酒吧消磨時間。但我好不容易才找到這家酒吧，在街上來回走動，沒有註意到這家酒吧的入口就在我旁邊，也許他們需要一些更能吸引人們注意的東西。

但是當我走上樓梯時，調酒師非常友好，與我解釋和談論了很多我非常喜歡的東西（也許我坐在吧台旁，如果你性格內向，喜歡一個人呆著，你可以得到一張桌子）

飲料很好喝，氣氛很好。

總的來說，我喜歡他們的服務。受到推崇的！","Well, I am waiting for my friend, so I decided to find a bar to dispel time.But I finally found this bar and walked back and forth on the street. I didn't notice that the entrance to this bar was next to me. Maybe they needed something that could attract people more attention.

But when I stepped on the stairs, the bartender was very friendly and explained and talked about a lot of things I like (maybe I sit next to the bar. If you are in an introverted personality and like a person to stay alone, you can get a piece of one table)

The drink is delicious and the atmosphere is good.

Overall, I like their services.Promote!"
"有一個會說日語的人。我能用我蹩腳的英文聽懂別人的意思。以台灣特色菜和茶為主的酒精飲料菜單有趣又美味！氣氛很好，講解也很詳盡。當你再次來到台灣時，我希望你能順便過來看看。

因為我晚上10點左右去的，所以被告知沒有菜單。既然是酒吧，我們建議您先吃點東西，然後去喝一杯。","There is a person who speaks Japanese.I can understand the meaning of others with my scratching English.Alcoholic beverages menu, which are based on Taiwan's specialty dishes and tea, are fun and delicious!The atmosphere is very good, and the explanation is very detailed.When you come to Taiwan again, I hope you can come and see by the way.

Because I went around 10 pm, I was told that there was no menu.Since it is a bar, we recommend that you eat something first and then drink a drink."
"喝雞尾酒的涼爽地方。週日晚上我們一行六人來到這裡。
我喜歡嘉義（較清淡的老式）。如果你喜歡芋頭，台中真的很不錯。","Drink a cool place for cocktails.We came here on Sunday evening.
I like Chiayi (lighter old -fashioned).If you like taro, Taichung is really good."
台北最好的酒吧！我和我的伴侶在酒吧度過了最美好的時光，提供了最好的服務，感謝傑和西蒙以及另一位我忘記了他名字的員工，他們太棒了！根據亞洲最佳50家酒吧名單，我們去了台北和新加坡的幾家不錯的酒吧，但即使soshow酒吧不在名單上，他們的飲料和服務也比名單上的許多酒吧都要好，強烈推薦！ 💯👍🏻👍🏻💯,"The best bar in Taipei!My partner and I spent the best time in the bar and provided the best service. Thank you Jie and Simon and another employee who I forgot his name. They are great!According to the 50 best bars in Asia, we went to several good bars in Taipei and Singapore, but even though the Soshow bar is not on the list, their drinks and services are better than many bars on the list. It is highly recommended!Bleak"
"很棒的地方！當我們發現這個地方時並沒有抱太大期望，但我必須說這裡的飲料非常棒，是台北最好的飲料之一。提供大量融合實驗性雞尾酒，使其獨一無二。

食物方面，它融合了台灣街頭小吃和西餐，非常有趣的組合，但與飲料搭配得很好。

工作人員都非常友好和樂於助人。這個地方不是很大，但是氛圍很棒。愛它！","A great place!When we found this place, we didn't expect much expectations, but I had to say that the drink here was very good and was one of the best beverages in Taipei.Provide a large amount of experimental cocktail to make it unique.

In terms of food, it integrates Taiwanese street snacks and western food. It is very interesting, but it is well matched with drinks.

The staff are very friendly and helpful.This place is not very large, but the atmosphere is great.Love it!"
"我可以肯定地說是台灣最好的酒吧。我們在台北待了 5 天，在逗留期間去了很多不同的酒吧，但沒有什麼可以與我們在這裡的經歷相媲美。我們原本喝的是招牌台灣地區風格的雞尾酒（這家酒吧因該雞尾酒而聞名），一開始就已經很棒了。調酒師傑實際上後來出來與我們交談，並告訴我們每種雞尾酒背後的靈感。他甚至為我們提供了菜單上沒有的選項，他認為我們在交談後可能會喜歡這些選項，以及一些新的選項，這些選項將在不久的將來包含在新菜單中！  我們本來打算每人喝兩杯，但到離開前一共喝了十杯！聽到這些故事真是太有趣了，我們當然希望下次訪問台北時這個地方仍然存在。另一位調酒師 Chou 也是一位非常有手工藝天賦的人，他親手製作了一些漂亮的酒具。我不得不把他製作的一件手工水泥玻璃器皿帶回家。總的來說，這是一次很棒的經歷，如果我們有機會再次訪問台灣，我們一定會回來的！

祝今晚火鍋宵夜你們吃的開心~~再次感謝你們的熱情款待🫶🏻🫶🏻","I can say certain that it is the best bar in Taiwan.We stayed in Taipei for 5 days and went to many different bars during staying, but nothing could be comparable to our experience here.We originally drank the cocktails of the signature Taiwan -style style (this bar is known for its cocktail), which was great from the beginning.In fact, the bartender Jie came out to talk to us and told us the inspiration behind each cocktail.He even provided us with the options not on the menu. He believes that we may like these options and some new options after talking. These options will be included in the new menu in the near future!We originally planned to drink two cups per person, but we drank ten cups in total before leaving!It is really interesting to hear these stories. Of course, we hope that the place in Taipei will still exist next time.Another bartender Chou is also a very talented person. He made some beautiful wine tools.I had to take a handmade cement glassware he made home.In general, this is a great experience. If we have the opportunity to visit Taiwan again, we will definitely come back!

I wish you all the happiness tonight, you are happy ~~ Thank you again for your enthusiastic money 🫶🏻🫶🏻"
"餐廳的氛圍非常酷，服務也非常出色。食物很美味，食材新鮮，烹飪得很好！素食也不錯的選擇:-)

我們作為客人住在AVANI+，所以我們還可以品嚐早餐，太棒了！

我絕對推薦！","The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cool and the service is very good.The food is delicious, the ingredients are fresh, and the cooking is very good!Vegetarian also good choices :-)

We live in Avani+as a guest, so we can also taste breakfast, which is great!

I absolutely recommend it!"
這是最好的款待。我和會說日語的人進行了很多交談，雞尾酒也很美味。,"This is the best hospitality.I talked a lot with people who could speak Japanese, and cocktails were also delicious."
"雖然有點貴，但是很好吃。工作人員非常友好。可以用英語對話。

我去的時候是8點左右，只喝酒的顧客很少，很多人只是邊吃邊喝。不過，只喝酒不吃東西是可以的。

最好在隔壁賣海膽烏龍麵的日本餐廳預訂並在這裡度過一段時光。

請注意，若1至4人前來，每人最低消費為新台幣350元。","Although it is a bit expensive, it is delicious.The staff is very friendly.You can talk in English.

When I went, there were very few customers who drank only, and many people just ate and drank.However, just drinking or not eating.

It is best to book a Japanese restaurant that sells sea urchins next door and spend time here for a while.

Please note that if 1 to 4 people come, the minimum consumption of each person is NT $ 350."
"以台灣各地為主體，提供特製的調酒！
主餐雖然只是簡單的義大利麵，但都很好吃😋
其他小食與菜餚也都在水準之上！ …","Taking all parts of Taiwan as the main body, provide special bartending!
Although the main meal is just a simple pasta, it is all delicious.
Other snacks and dishes are also above the standard!Mowing"
台北最好的酒吧之一。台灣各地的雞尾酒都是用當地食材調製而成的。強烈推薦！,One of the best bars in Taipei.Cocktails across Taiwan are prepared by local ingredients.Recommended strongly!
我在台灣乃至全世界最喜歡的酒吧。是的，就是這麼好！最好的雞尾酒，一流的服務，這裡的每個人都很好，食物也很棒。 10/10可以推薦！,"I am the favorite bar in Taiwan and even the world.Yes, it's so good!The best cocktails, first -class services, everyone here is very good, and the food is great.10/10 can be recommended!"
"主管?會一定程度的日文。
這裡的原創雞尾酒絕對不會錯，所以我強烈推薦它們。
如果你不確定，可以向店長尋求建議，他會給出一個^ ^

這是一家我還想再去的店。","Supervisor? Will to a certain degree of Japanese.
The original cocktails here are definitely not wrong, so I highly recommend them.
If you are not sure, you can seek suggestions from the store manager, he will give a ^ ^

This is a shop I want to go again."
"位於台北市的溫馨舒適的酒吧，搭乘捷運即可輕鬆抵達。
飲料單非常有趣和獨特，我想嘗試很多，食物很好吃。","A warm and comfortable bar located in Taipei City can easily arrive by MRT.
The drink list is very interesting and unique. I want to try a lot and the food is delicious."
食物和飲料都很棒！台灣炸雞的味道不如街頭小販的。,Food and drinks are great!The taste of fried chicken in Taiwan is not as good as street hawkers.
這是我在台灣最喜歡的酒吧之一！很難到達，幾乎就像地下酒吧一樣。這些飲料需要一段時間才能製作，但那是因為它製作得如此仔細！如果您第一次來台灣，菜單上會顯示台灣地圖，每個城鎮都有特色飲料。這幫助我更多地了解這個國家。我已經嘗試了菜單上幾乎一半的飲料，它們都很棒，這取決於您想要什麼。另外，我建議喝樓梯飲料，其中一些不太好，但嘗試飲料樣品總是很有趣。,"This is one of my favorite bars in Taiwan!It's hard to reach, almost like a underground bar.These drinks take a period of time to make it, but that is because it is so careful!If you come to Taiwan for the first time, the menu will be displayed on the menu, and each town will have special beverages.This helps me know more about this country.I have tried almost half of the drinks on the menu, and they are great, depending on what you want.In addition, I recommend drinking stairs drinks, some of which are not very good, but trying drink samples is always interesting."
"特殊的台灣風情調酒，表現相當出色。
特別な台灣風情カクテルはおいしくて面白い。","Special Taiwan style sake, expression of expression.
Special Taiwanese -style cocktails are delicious and interesting."
如果我是這裡的當地人，我會回來♥️🫶,"If I am the locals here, I will come back ♥ ️🫶"
出色的酒吧。酒吧工作人員對所提供的所有烈酒非常了解，而且食物非常好。如果您在 Teipei 尋找一些雞尾酒和食物，絕對會推薦您來聽聽。,"Outstanding bar.Bar staff knows very well for all the spirits provided, and the food is very good.If you look for some cocktails and foods in TeiPei, you will definitely recommend you to listen."
"來這裡只是為了喝酒。雞尾酒看起來很酷，展示了台灣獨特的地理和歷史。然而，我嘗試的飲料最終嘗起來更像經典。

我點了苗栗香茅，但嘗起來更像莫斯科騾子。建議將飲料放在平底玻璃杯中，然後將葉子包裹在玻璃杯上，同時丟棄吸管。飲用者在飲用時能夠聞到青草的味道，進而增強飲料的味道。

我還點了台中大甲。前兩口還不錯，但不久之後，我似乎只是在喝貝利酒。建議（但我知道會很昂貴）是在其中添加一大塊芋頭。或者，使用一層芋泥並將其放在玻璃杯的頂部，再次使用氣味來增強和欺騙感官。

也許是因為我們坐在酒吧，但飲料的服務並不像我希望的那麼友善。通常人們坐在酒吧是為了享受與調酒師的互動。酒保沒有註意到。","It's just for drinking here.The cocktail looks cool, showing Taiwan's unique geography and history.However, the drinks I tried finally tasted more like classic.

I ordered Miaoli Tunomai, but it tasted more like Moscow's mule.It is recommended to put the drink in a flat glass, then wrap the leaves on the glass, and discard the straw at the same time.Drinkers can smell the smell of grass when drinking, and then enhance the taste of the beverage.

I also ordered Taichung Dajia.The first two were pretty good, but soon after, I seemed to be drinking Bailey.Suggestion (but I know it will be expensive) to add a large taro in it.Alternatively, use a layer of taro puree and place it on the top of the glass, and use the smell to enhance and deceive the senses again.

Perhaps because we are sitting in a bar, but the service of drinks is not as friendly as I hope.People usually sit in the bar to enjoy the interaction with the bartender.The bartender did not notice."
"環境乾淨舒適，有陽台抽菸區，還有大螢幕電視可以觀賞球賽！服務員雖然外表看起來酷酷的，但人都蠻親切！

調酒內容是針對臺灣在地特色與歷史而設計許多特色調酒！很新鮮有趣！酒的口感也不錯！

推 食 物！
薯條很大盤必點，牛肉、松阪豬都很嫩好吃！ ！三杯雞義大利麵與麻油雞燉飯很有特色，味道也很濃鬱！

老闆有時還請喝shot與其他酒！ （還用戰鬥碗喝紅酒）😆是朋友聚會的好選擇😇😇","The environment is clean and comfortable, there are balcony smoking areas, and large screen TVs to watch the game!Although the waiter looks cool in appearance, people are quite kind!

The content of bartending is aimed at Taiwan's local characteristics and history. Many characteristic bartendants are designed!Very fresh and interesting!The taste of wine is also good!

Push food!
French fries are very large, beef and Matsusaka pigs are very tender and delicious!IntersectionThree cups of chicken noodles and sesame oil stewed rice are very distinctive, and the taste is rich!

Sometimes the boss also please drink Shot and other wine!(Also drinking red wine with a battle bowl) 😆 is a good choice for a friend's party 😇😇"
"這是一次非常好的經驗！
工作人員非常細心、有禮貌並且對菜單非常了解。
他們也能夠用英語溝通。
最重要的是，食物很棒，更不用說酒吧的氣氛了，儘管有一個供吸煙者使用的露台。
總而言之，很棒！","This is a very good experience!
The staff is very careful, polite, and knows the menu very well.
They can also communicate in English.
The most important thing is that the food is great, let alone the atmosphere of the bar, although there is a terrace used for smokers.
All in all, great!"
使用台灣水果調製的雞尾酒共有12種。有些雞尾酒會用香料燻製來搭配酒精，既出人意料，又視覺享受。,"There are 12 cocktails used in Taiwan fruits.Some cocktails will be smoked with spices with alcohol, which is unexpected and visually enjoyable."
"與朋友閒逛和結識新朋友的好地方！
他們推出了一系列最具創意的雞尾酒，結合台灣當地特色與酒類，驚艷你的味蕾！
不要錯過！","Wandering up and knowing new friends with friends!
They launched a series of most creative cocktails, combined with local characteristics and alcohol in Taiwan, stunning your taste buds!
Don't miss it!"
"是與朋友聚會、享用美食和飲料的好地方。以台灣地方為主題的美味雞尾酒。台北是清酒加茶，這是一種顯示日本在殖民時期影響的方式。另一個「系列」是幾款以台灣歷史為基礎的招牌雞尾酒。真的很想嘗試一切。

適合帶外國朋友來的調飯店，好喝又星巴克台灣特色，好評。","It is a good place to meet with friends and enjoy food and drinks.Delicious cocktail with the theme of Taiwan.Taipei is sake and tea, which is a way to show the impact of Japan during the colonial period.Another ""series"" is several signature cocktails based on Taiwan's history.I really want to try everything.

Suitable for a restaurant with foreign friends, delicious and Starbucks Taiwan characteristics, praise."
"飲料非常特別，將台灣風格融入雞尾酒中。
飲料是300左右。價格相當不錯。
食物很棒，服務很好","Drinks are very special, incorporating Taiwan style into cocktails.
The drink is about 300.The price is pretty good.
The food is great and the service is very good"
品質優良、風味獨特的雞尾酒,Good quality and unique flavor of cocktails
很棒的酒吧，有著很棒的員工、雞尾酒和氛圍。強烈推薦，下次我們來台北時我們會回來的。,"A great bar, with great employees, cocktails and atmosphere.Strongly recommended, we will come back when we come to Taipei next time."
他們提供美味的雞尾酒。強烈推薦他們的杜松子酒雞尾酒。,They provide delicious cocktails.It is highly recommended for their Du Songzi wine cocktail.
"我對這家店真的很有興趣。
良好的氛圍，優美的音樂，
我慢慢地喝著酒。","I am really interested in this shop.
Good atmosphere, beautiful music,
I slowly drank."
令人印象深刻的雞尾酒，帶有台灣水果的味道。可以和朋友在這裡度過一個愉快的夜晚。,The impressive cocktail has the taste of Taiwanese fruits.You can spend a pleasant night with your friends.
雞尾酒菜單非常獨特，而且都非常好。服務非常好，非常友好，對外國人很熱情。食物也很美味。,"The cocktail menu is very unique and very good.The service is very good, very friendly, and very enthusiastic about foreigners.The food is also delicious."
"菜單是日文的，所以你可以了解雞尾酒的內容！
工作人員不會說日語。
這裡有以台灣各地為主題的雞尾酒，名為“冉島旅行”，不妨停下來嘗試一下征服這一切(*･о･*)
這次我點了“台北信”，一種以清酒為基礎的酒精飲料。","The menu is Japanese, so you can understand the content of the chicken tail!
The staff will not speak Japanese.
There are cocktails with themes of all parts of Taiwan, named ""Randao Travel"", you may stop trying to conquer all of this (*･о･*)
This time I ordered ""Taipei Xin"", a alcoholic drink based on sake."
絕對是台北最好的酒吧之一。它適合英語，價格還可以，飲料非常好，但我建議您相信調酒師會製作原創的東西。工作人員都非常友善，在為您泡飲料的同時願意聊天。它非常適合一大群人，因為有大桌子，但它也有一個舒適的氛圍，適合您自己度過一個輕鬆的時刻。作為一個外國人，我會說10/10。,"It is definitely one of the best bars in Taipei.It is suitable for English, the price is okay, and the drink is very good, but I suggest you believe that the bartender will make original things.The staff are very friendly, and they are willing to chat while making drinks for you.It is very suitable for a large group of people, because there are large tables, but it also has a comfortable atmosphere, suitable for you to spend a relaxed moment yourself.As a foreigner, I will say 10/10."
雞尾酒和小吃有多種選擇。,There are many options for cocktails and snacks.
你一定要去這個地方並嘗試莫吉托。這真是令人耳目一新。 Polo，店主將很樂意為您提供各種雞尾酒並暢飲他的酒吧提供的飲品,"You must go to this place and try Mogito.This is really refreshing.POLO, the owner will be happy to provide you with a variety of cocktails and drink the drinks provided by his bar"
雞尾酒採用多種台灣本土元素調製而成，非常獨特👍 …,"Cocktail is made of a variety of local elements of Taiwan, which is very unique ..."
"有些員工處理事情很專業，有些則不然。  也不知道他們為什麼要播放電影電視頻道，這會分散注意力，對氣氛沒有幫助。沒有聖誕裝飾品（好吧，陽台門上有一個）也沒有音樂。
食物很不錯。扇貝燴飯、墨西哥肉醬義大利麵、烤起司（最喜歡）和雞蛋、蘿蔔糕和薯條都很棒。我個人不太喜歡牛腸義大利麵。
飲料我們喜歡桃園、高雄。冰淇淋（台中）很有趣，但我更喜歡桃園（它有茶）。  高雄投票勝過台南。
非常感謝願意滿足我們需求的工作人員。
2022.12","Some employees are professional, and some are not.I don't know why they play the movie and television channels, which will be distracted and it is not helpful to the atmosphere.No Christmas decorations (well, there is one on the balcony door) without music.
The food is very good.Scallops stew, Mexican meat sauce Italian noodles, roasted cheese (favorite) and eggs, radish cakes and fries are great.I personally don't like the pastoral pasta.
We like Taoyuan and Kaohsiung.Ice cream (Taichung) is very interesting, but I prefer Taoyuan (it has tea).Kaohsiung voted better than Tainan.
Thank you very much for the staff who are willing to meet our needs.

"靈感來自台灣的時尚美味雞尾酒！
所有的工作人員都很友善，很照顧我。","Inspired by Taiwan's fashionable cocktail!
All staff are friendly and take care of me."
一個很酷的樓上酒吧，遠離繁忙的街道。不錯的飲品菜單，種類繁多。服務不錯,"A cool upstairs bar away from the busy street.Good drink menu, there are many types.Good service"
食物很棒，飲料很棒，調酒師非常友好 - 他們提供了極好的推薦以及飲料所基於的歷史和文化。很棒的經驗。,"The food is great, the drink is great, and the bartender is very friendly -they provide excellent recommendations and the history and culture based on beverage.Great experience."
非常酷的主題、飲料、食物和環境。喜歡它。,"Very cool theme, drinks, food and environment.Like it."
可以稱這個地方為威士忌酒吧。有多種威士忌選擇和大量雞尾酒選擇。它還為一些飲料提供了非常精美的雞尾酒演示。你可以來這裡吃飯，但我不能告訴你它怎麼樣，因為我沒有在這裡吃飯。總的來說，對於台灣來說非常好的酒吧。,"It can be called a whiskey bar.There are multiple chosen and a large number of cocktails.It also provides a very exquisite cocktail demonstration for some beverages.You can come here for dinner, but I can't tell you how it is because I don't eat here.In general, a very good bar for Taiwan."
品質不如半年前那麼好，而是專注於商業事務而不是改善食品或飲料。,"The quality is not as good as half a year ago, but focusing on business affairs rather than improving food or drinks."
友善的員工，非常獨特的雞尾酒，但是…我等了大約20 分鐘，而沒有其他顧客，我們都喝了比酒還多的冰（我沒有誇張，我們的NT300+ 雞尾酒中都有巨大的冰塊）。味道不錯，但不推薦。,"Friendly employees, very unique cocktails, but ... I waited for about 20 minutes without other customers. We all drank more ice than wine (I didn't exaggerate, our NT300+ cocktails have huge ice cubes)) EssenceThe taste is good, but it is not recommended."
看起來真的很特別的飲料，但不幸的是有些味道並不像聽起來那麼好。,"It looks really special drinks, but unfortunately, some taste is not as good as it sounds."
每個訂單都很滿意！美味的雞尾酒和美味的食物來放鬆:),Every order is very satisfied!Delicious cocktails and delicious foods to relax :)
"友善的員工，美味的食物，舒適的氛圍！
店家特別推薦的是台灣特色炸肉排，採用台灣各地區的特產製作而成。一邊喝著充滿故事的台灣特色糕點，一邊感覺自己在台灣旅遊。除此之外，生啤酒真的很清爽，而且價格也很合理！如果你住在西門町附近，值得一去的酒吧。","Friendly employees, delicious food, comfortable atmosphere!
The store specially recommends the characteristic fried meat rows of Taiwan, which is made from specialty products in various regions of Taiwan.While drinking the story full of stories, I feel traveling in Taiwan.In addition, raw beer is really refreshing, and the price is reasonable!If you live near Ximending, a bar worth going to."
威而鋼先生請了我們酒，我們在這裡度過了一段美好的時光！食物和葡萄酒的特色是有史以來最好的。這是有史以來最好的酒吧。如果你來台灣中山地區，絕對不能錯過。,"Mr. Wergang invited us wine, we spent a good time here!Food and wine are characterized by the best ever.This is the best bar ever.If you come to the Zhongshan area of ​​Taiwan, you must not miss it."
"一家令人愉快的商店。食物和飲料都很好。
食材也很豐富，用來做菜也是可以的。
工作人員很友善，但他們不會說日語（英語還可以）。不過，有日文菜單，所以不會有任何問題。
我經常在這裡看到日本顧客，所以我猜這是一家相當有名的商店。
問題是入口有點難找。 Google 地圖上的位置是正確的。老建築2
這是地板。","A pleasant store.Food and drinks are very good.
The ingredients are also very rich, and it is also possible to cook.
The staff is very friendly, but they do not speak Japanese (English).However, there are Japanese menu, so there are no problems.
I often see Japanese customers here, so I guess this is a very famous shop.
The problem is that the entrance is a bit difficult to find.The location on Google map is correct.Old architecture 2
This is the floor."
雞尾酒很棒！氣氛很冷。,Cocktails are great!The atmosphere is cold.
很溫暖的酒吧.....搭配上濃鬱的三杯雞意大利麵以及具有台灣特色調酒.在舒服的座椅上享受著美食美酒....在愜意不過了,Very warm bar ..... with a strong three cup of chicken pasta and a Taiwan characteristic bartender. Enjoy food wine on a comfortable seat ....
很棒的地方，看世界盃很舒服。酒普通,"A great place, it is comfortable to see the World Cup.Alcohol"
如果您想嘗試台灣雞尾酒，這是個好地方,"If you want to try Taiwan cocktails, this is a good place"
用台灣各地特產調製的雞尾酒給我留下了深刻的印象。第一次透過雞尾酒認識台灣！我強烈推薦它！,The cocktails prepared by specialty products in Taiwan left a deep impression on me.The first time I met Taiwan through cocktails!I highly recommend it!
"我在台北最好的酒吧體驗之一。很舒服，老闆的服務很友善（國語、英語和粵語👍🏼）。

我會再回來的！ …","I am one of the best bars in Taipei.Very comfortable, the boss's service is very friendly (Mandarin, English and Cantonese).

I will come back again!Mowing"
友善的員工和味道乾淨的美味食物。  我和妻子一起去了這裡，我們切了炸薯條（外面很脆），吃了蘑菇，還有一個美味的三明治，就像俱樂部三明治一樣，外面是炸麵包片。,"Friendly employees and clean delicious food.My wife and I went here. We cut the fries (crispy outside), eaten mushrooms, and a delicious sandwich, just like the club sandwiches, the outside is bread."
餐好吃，酒好喝,"The meal is delicious, the wine is delicious"
"如果有的話會給一個負星。根據您是否是外國人，服務會有很大差異。我沒有受到歡迎或入座，工作人員主動無視我們的服務請求，我們不被允許坐在沙發上，因為「其他人預訂了」但從未出現。

可能是我在餐廳+酒廊酒吧經歷過的最糟糕的服務。","If so, give a negative star.According to whether you are foreigners, the service will be very different.I have not been welcomed or seated. The staff actively ignore our service request. We are not allowed to sit on the sofa because ""the others have booked"" but never appeared.

It may be the worst service I have experienced in the restaurant+bar gallery bar."
獨特的飲品精美呈現。有點貴，特別是對台灣來說，但這是一次愉快的經驗。他們還提供美味的小吃。,"The unique drink is exquisite.It's a bit expensive, especially for Taiwan, but this is a pleasant experience.They also provide delicious snacks."
"有很多原創的雞尾酒，我對它們都很感興趣。我們能夠在舒適的氛圍中享用飲品。
下次我想嘗試這裡的食物。","There are many original cocktails, and I am very interested in them.We can enjoy drinks in a comfortable atmosphere.
Next time I want to try the food here."
以令人印象深刻的技巧和演示製作出美味的雞尾酒。義大利麵非常美味，一定要嚐嚐老港雞尾酒！,"Make delicious cocktails with impressive skills and demonstrations.The pasta is very delicious, you must try the old Hong Kong cocktail!"
中山地區舒適的酒吧餐廳，空間寬敞，風景優美。雞尾酒有點貴，但絕對物超所值。,"The comfortable bar and restaurant in Zhongshan area has spacious space and beautiful scenery.Cocktail is a bit expensive, but it is definitely worth it."
喜歡這個地方！這裡的人都超級友善！找到有點棘手，因為它是在 4 號麵粉上。如果你有時間並且想喝一杯，你應該徹底檢查一下這個地方並在這裡放鬆一會兒！,"Like this place!The people here are super friendly!It is a bit tricky because it is on the 4th flour.If you have time and want to have a drink, you should check this place thoroughly and relax here for a while!"
非常宜人的休息室環境，可以一邊喝雞尾酒一邊度過一個晚上。還有原創雞尾酒可以嘗試。可以吃小菜（國際美食）,"Very pleasant lounge environment, where you can spend a night while drinking the cocktails.Also original cocktails can be tried.Can eat small dishes (international cuisine)"

非常好的酒吧，提供美味的雞尾酒,"Very good bar, provide delicious cocktails"
不錯，有英文，價格也不算貴，不收餐桌費。  度過午夜航班之前的好地方。,"Yes, there is English, the price is not expensive, not collecting table fees.Before the midnight flight, a good place."
雞尾酒是正宗的台灣風格，味道很棒。但人員還可以更好。,Cocktail is an authentic Taiwanese style and tastes great.But personnel can be better.

這是一個很棒的酒吧！可以喝到多種台灣元素的酒。,This is a great bar!You can drink a variety of Taiwanese elements.
有趣的概念展示了台灣的整個地理。飲料偏甜（例如非常甜）。,The interesting concept shows the entire geography of Taiwan.The drink is sweet (such as very sweet).
傍晚時分，周圍沒有人，我順便過來喝了一杯，但當我獨自坐在窗邊時，他們告訴我換到中間的一張桌子。所有的員工不是在抽煙，就是在玩手機，我在那裡，但他們毫不猶豫地給我菜單，因為我告訴他們我很快就會離開，這讓我感覺很糟糕，所以我立即離開了。這是歡迎來到他們商店的外國顧客的最糟糕的方式。,"In the evening, there was no one around me. I came over to drink a drink by the way, but when I was sitting alone by the window, they told me to change to a table in the middle.All employees were smoking or playing mobile phones. I was there, but they did not hesitate to give me the menu, because I told them that I would leave soon, which made me feel bad, so I immediately left.This is the worst way to welcome foreign customers in their stores."
下班後喝一杯的舒適休閒場所。好喝的飲料，台灣當地水果的靈感🍹 …,"Drink a cup of comfortable leisure after get off work.A delicious drink, the inspiration of local fruits in Taiwan 🍹 ..."

我來這裡喝雞尾酒並愛上了配菜，我強烈推薦起司馬鈴薯。雞尾酒沒有我想像的那麼漂亮。,I came here to drink cocktails and fell in love with side dishes. I strongly recommend cheese potatoes.Cocktail is not as beautiful as I think.
酒口味好喝外，炸物也好吃,"In addition to the taste of the wine, the fried object is delicious"
如此。地方很小，裝飾是典型的酒吧，食物和服務都不錯。,"in this way.The place is very small, and the decoration is a typical bar. Food and services are good."
美好的地方。建議預訂。氣氛活躍，員工友善。,"Beautiful place.It is recommended to book.The atmosphere is active, and the employees are friendly."
