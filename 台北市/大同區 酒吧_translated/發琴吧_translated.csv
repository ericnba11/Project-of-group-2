這是日本不常見的杜松子酒專賣店。環顧四周，我發現顧客群都是年輕、有品味的，而且每個人都表現得很好。我坐在吧台，但座位有點小，無法放鬆。我觀察店裡的工作人員，有一個做得很好，但也有一些還在練習。老實說，我希望他們喝啤酒和威士忌。,"This is the uncommon Du Songzi wine store in Japan.Looking around, I found that the customer base is young and delicious, and everyone performs well.I sat on the bar, but the seat was a bit small to relax.I observed that one of the staff in the store did well, but some were still practicing.Honestly, I hope they drink beer and whiskey.",False
你猜對了，杜松子酒種類繁多，甚至有些我沒聽過。  很好的 G&T 和內格羅尼，很棒的杜松子酒馬提尼。  酒保對我們有點冷淡……也許只是語言障礙,"You guess right, there are many types of Du Songzi wine, and even some I have never heard of it.Very good G & T and Negranini, great Dutongzi wine Maridini.The bartender is a bit cold to us ... Maybe it's just a language barrier",False

"我於2023年5月2日至3日訪問過。
我聽說過一家杜松子酒專賣店，所以我很期待看看那是一家甚麼樣的酒吧。酒吧位於大樓三樓，因此您可以從一樓透過無線方式查看座位狀態。

走上樓梯進入店內，映入眼簾的是華麗的櫃檯和後方的吧台。
我點的第一件事是馬丁尼。金酒是我最喜歡的酒精飲料，但我對牌子不熟悉，所以調酒師問我用什麼金酒來做，所以我讓他用他認為最適合Ta的金酒。
這是我經常使用的技巧，但當我點雞尾酒且不知道品牌時，它會引起很多注意。
雖然有點甜，但這是一杯美味的雞尾酒。

我喝了很多酒，但最後還是喝了一杯杜松子酒和滋補品，然後離開了酒吧。

氣氛很好，隔天又去酒吧逛逛。當我點了一杯乾杜松子酒時，我意識到調酒師有一種有趣的方式來調整配方，並且有能力在當晚招待顧客。","I visited from May 2nd to 3rd, 2023.
I have heard a Du Songzi wine store, so I look forward to seeing what kind of bar is it.The bar is located on the third floor of the building, so you can view the seat status through wireless ways on the first floor.

Entering the stairs into the store, the gorgeous counters and the bar are in the eyes of the stairs.
The first thing I ordered was Martini.Golden wine is my favorite alcoholic drink, but I am not familiar with the brand, so the bartender asked me what golden wine to make, so I asked him to use the golden wine he thought he thought best for TA.
This is the technique I often use, but when I order cocktails and do not know the brand, it can attract a lot of attention.
Although a bit sweet, this is a delicious cocktail.

I drank a lot of wine, but in the end I drank a glass of Du Songzi wine and tonic, and then left the bar.

The atmosphere is very good, go to the bar the next day.When I ordered a cup of Du Songzi wine, I realized that the bartender had an interesting way to adjust the formula and had the ability to entertain customers that night.",False
