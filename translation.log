The second floor is a simple wooden light style in the dining area. The catering personally feels like the outdoor camping. Nutsm and cooked egg oolong noodles are very good to eat the main dishes next to the side dishes are salty and small rolls. The XO sauce and the nuts of the nuts are really fragrant and smooth mixing half -cooked eggs. Real materials are half potatoes and large pieces of carrots to increase the sweetness of the soup. The chicken first coated sauce and fried until golden and crispy and then placed in the curry soup. The soup is thin and not greasy. The insulation bottle is afraid of cold, pineapple mango Baili aroma soaking drinks are really large pieces of pineapple slices and inserted in the drink to eat.
There is also a special dessert with special shapes: hot pot -style muffins, the appearance is very crispy like a bowl edge, similar to the hardness of French bread. In the end, the heat of the hot pot will quickly melt ice cream. It will be a bit terrible, but I give him four stars as a whole!

甜點類點的是紅茶烏龍乳酪蛋糕，不會太甜，茶香奶香都很濃，真材實料，配茶很對味，煎餅也好好吃∼

There is a seal in the shop to cover ~ full of heart

Meal thought: There are not many meals, now order, and the meal is not fast.

Matson milk sauce hot spring mixing oolong noodles: I chose "tender fried small rolls". The small roll is delicious and it seems to be roasted. It has no fishy smell.The dry noodles have seaweed soup, and the soup is qualified.Pickled radish will not be too sour and tastes good.There are a lot of hot spring eggs and milk sauce on Oolong noodles, and the dishes are: tomatoes, firewood slices, corn bamboo shoots, glutinous rice pepper and so on.

有 Salted and sweet cheese: There are meat pine and salted egg yolk, which is very good, and the cake is very fragrant!

瓜 Jinshan Zixin sweet potato milk: super like drink, full of ingredients!It will not be too sweet. Although the milk smell is average, the aroma of sweet potatoes is out, and a few slices of sweet potato are added with a small piece of sweet potato.The sweet potato puree underneath should be stirred well, it is better to taste ~

， There is an outdoor space. You can go out and take pictures on the first and third floors. There are some arrangements.The lights at night should be full of atmosphere ~

(I feel that we are lucky, and we order it well. Seeing the "beautiful" drinks of others, we can't drink half of it ... suspecting the taste discomfort)

I went to other cafes on the same day, this one is worthy of it ... I really compare it

It seems to be a vegetarian meal

2024-11-21 01:37:30,341 - INFO - 翻譯成功：說真的，餐點也不能說沒有誠意，其實配料滿豐富的，感覺也盡力在給料了，但很多食材搭配起來口感或口味無法取得和諧，滿可惜的。

烏龍麵的麵條是最失敗的，口感非常差，以致於我和朋友都沒辦法吃完那些麵條，湯頭淡薄無深度，我個人口味是屬於清淡類型的，但這個湯喝一喝甚至會讓人感覺有點空虛。不過硬要說的話，湯很淡也不是不能接受，但強烈建議麵條一定要換。

巴斯克蛋糕是當天最好吃的餐點。

鑄鐵鍋的鬆餅，熱熱的很好吃，但敗筆是那二塊米香，因為熱鬆餅讓冰淇淋融化得非常快，米香一碰到溶化的冰，口感就變得爛糊。其中蘋果的部分則是雖然它很鮮脆，但由於口感跟其他食材差異太大，非常不和諧，建議蘋果可以先煎軟，做成焦糖蘋果，然後把米香分開放，應該會加分不少。

磅蛋糕則是當天用餐體驗中的災難，太濕、不好吃，連拍照都不好看。既然不是店家製作的產品，建議要對售出的商品稍做把關。

由於是特地騎了二小時機車過去用餐，餐點的體驗的確是讓人感到稍稍失望，不過還是可以感受到店家對環保的用心，店內的氣氛也很舒服，如果有機會再去，希望可以吃到進化後的餐點。 -> Seriously, the meal cannot be said to have no sincerity. In fact, the ingredients are full of ingredients, and they feel that they are trying to give it, but it is a pity that many ingredients have the taste or taste that cannot be harmonized.

The noodles of the oolong noodles are the most failed, and the taste is very poor, so that neither I and my friends can finish eating those noodles. The soup head is thin and depth. My personality belongs to a light type, but this soup will even make people even make people people even make people make people. It feels a bit empty.However, if you want to say it, it is not unacceptable to the soup, but it is strongly recommended that the noodles must be changed.

Basque cake is the best meal that day.

The muffin of the cast iron pot is very delicious, but the defeat is the two pieces of rice incense, because the hot muffins make the ice cream melt very quickly. As soon as the rice fragrant encounters the melted ice, the taste becomes messy.Among them, the part of the Apple is that although it is very crispy, because the taste is too different from other ingredients, it is very discordant. It is recommended that apples can be fry first, make caramel apples, and then open rice fragrance. few.

The pound cake is the disaster in the dining experience that day. It is too wet and not delicious. Even taking pictures is not good -looking.Since it is not a product made by the store, it is recommended to check the selling products slightly.

Since the two -hour dining for two hours, the meal experience is indeed a little disappointed, but you can still feel the intention of the store's environmental protection, and the atmosphere in the store is also very comfortable. If you have the opportunity to go again, you hope to eat it. To the evolution meal.

2024-11-21 01:37:38,926 - INFO - 翻譯成功：位於北海岸的一個複合式餐飲店。店名「靠北過日子」中的「靠北」貼切地說明了店家位置，距離台灣本島最北點的富貴角只有15公里，不過，「過日子」我想才這家店真正的重點。以一個海岸咖啡店來說Q B Days的內部裝潢相對樸實，從室內座席望出去的海景也還好，但或許Q B Days從一開始的訴求就不是這些而是和店家理念結合的一種「生活感」。這生活感在店裡處處可見，包括一樓的像是雜貨店的販賣空間(品項以露營等戶外生活為主)，二樓的室內的營帳設計，以及我最喜歡的那還有著營火的海邊營地，看著那片可坐享海灣美景的營地，似乎可以想像店家自己在北海岸的這個角落「生活」的情景。店外空間其他有生活感的部份還包括一個樹蔭下一樣可以遠眺遠方海面的板凳、屋頂的空間等等。只能說，Q B Days真的是處處都有一種生活的氣息，這也是我最喜歡它的地方。

目前內用的餐飲低銷金額較高，單人用餐只單點一杯飲料肯定不夠而必須搭配其他像是點心蛋糕等等，若多人一起用餐分擔下來或許會更划算，不過，我想要在北海岸這個很多時候都頗為艱苦的地方「生活」總需要經濟來源(畢竟不是去捕魚或種瓜)，所以若認同其理念、喜歡這個氛圍還是值得支持一下。這次所點的所有品項包括巴斯克蛋糕和薄荷檸檬也都不錯是額外加分。

“Quiet B. Days”中的”quiet”意思比較明確，那麼”B.”意指什麼？除了可以是Bay外，我在店內販賣區看到一個上頭標了b stands for beautiful的pin buckle，對我來說這個詮釋更適合。

可以一訪 -> A composite restaurant located on the North Coast.The store name "Live on the North" "north" explains the location of the store, which is only 15 kilometers away from the wealthy corner of the northernmost point of Taiwan.For a coastal coffee shop, the interior decoration of Q B Days is relatively simple, and the sea view from the indoor seat is also okay, but maybe Q B Days from the beginning is not these but a "sense of life combined with the store concept. "".This sense of life can be seen everywhere in the store, including the trafficking space like grocery stores on the first floor (mainly outdoor life such as camping), the indoor accounting design on the second floor, and my favorite. Sea camps, watching the camp that can enjoy the beauty of the bay, it seems that you can imagine the "life" scene of the store himself on the corner of the North Coast.Other living parts outside the store also include a bench, roof space, and so on.It can only be said that Q B DAYS really has a breath of life everywhere, which is also my favorite place.

At present, the low sales of catering internally are relatively high. Only one cup of drinks for single meals must be not enough, and it must be paired with other snack cakes. It may be more cost -effective if many people eat together. This is often a difficult place for "life" in the North Coast. "Life" always requires economic sources (after all, not fishing or planting melons), so if you agree with its concept and like this atmosphere, it is worth supporting.All the items at the point this time include Basque cake and mint lemon are also good.

"Quiet" in "Quiet B. Days" means clearly, so "B." does "B." mean?In addition to Bay, I saw a Pin Buckle marked with B Stands for Beautiful in the store in the store, which is more suitable for me.

2024-11-21 01:37:41,283 - INFO - 翻譯成功：今天點了麵包德腸佐堅果沙拉和鐵鍋鬆餅（泰奶冰淇淋）。

堅果沙拉醬好吃。推薦！
德腸大約只有大拇哥長度。
這一次附上的起司野菇麵包體太鹹不合我口味，捨棄它沒吃完。

鐵鍋鬆餅裡頭放了三種水果、兩塊米香和兩球冰淇淋。
水果當令，所以好吃。
米香一為原味、一為焦糖。但是不夠酥脆，在口中無法爽快的咬碎、又黏牙，所以跟冰淇淋的口感不搭。焦糖+冰淇淋又太甜，所以也被我捨棄不吃。

重點的鬆餅：
利用鬆餅作為承裝容器的發想非常好，但是就得吃掉大部分的內容物後，才能開始吃鬆餅。（看看別人評論裡附的照片就知道我在說什麼）
我想吃的是鬆餅，不是水果和冰淇淋，更不是米香。

但，我想沒人能在兩球冰淇淋融化前就吃完它，然後得到一碗乾爽的鬆餅。
所以我吃到的大部分的鬆餅體，入口時都是浸濕在冰淇淋醬裡的軟綿（爛）口感，鬆餅的味道也多會取決於你所挑選的冰淇淋，今天選的泰奶口味太甜，很容易膩。錯的是泰奶冰淇淋。

如果把一球冰淇淋用日式昭和布丁（比較硬 、蛋味重的那一種）來替換，是否會好些？

如果我下一次再來，我還是會點鐵鍋鬆餅。但是我會要求鬆餅碗堣ㄜn放東西，把那些內容物另外裝給我。若店家不幫我這麼作，我就放棄這鬆餅。 -> Today I ordered the bread deed sausage salad and iron pot muffin (Thai milk ice cream).

Nut salad sauce is delicious.recommend!
There is only about the length of the thumb.
This time the cheese mushroom bread is too salty and disagreed with my taste.

There are three kinds of fruits, two rice incense and two -ball ice cream in the iron pot muffins.
Fruits should be ordered, so it is delicious.
Mi Xiang is original and one is caramel.But it is not crispy enough, and it can't be bitten and sticky in the mouth, so it does not match the taste of ice cream.Caramel+ice cream is too sweet, so I am abandoned or not.

The key muffins:
It is very good to use muffins as a container, but you have to eat most of the contents before you can start eating muffins.(Look at the photos attached to someone else's comments and know what I'm talking about)
I want to eat muffins, not fruits and ice cream, nor rice fragrant.

However, I think no one can eat it before the two -ball ice cream melts, and then get a bowl of dry muffins.
So most of the muffins I have eaten, the soft (rotten) taste soaked in the ice cream sauce at the entrance, and the taste of the muffin depends on the ice cream you selected. The taste is too sweet and easy to get tired.The wrong one is Thai milk ice cream.

If a ball ice cream is replaced with a Japanese -style Showa pudding (the one with a hard and heavy egg flavor), will it be better?

If I come again next time, I will still order iron pot muffins.But I will ask not to put things in the muffin bowl and install those contents to me separately.If the shop does not help me, I will give up this pine cake.

2024-11-21 01:37:42,260 - INFO - 翻譯成功：疫情期間店內不開冷氣，靠窗的座位會有海風吹拂，店內也備有電風扇，但是怕熱的朋友需三思。
用餐時間限時100分鐘，即使在店內未客滿的狀態下也無法延長時間，所以個人覺得並不適合三五好友聊天聚餐。
餐點部份∼
魚香奶醬溫泉蛋乾拌麵：將整個溫泉蛋攪和至烏龍麵裡之後其實沒什麼蛋味，奶味也不會太濃稠，因此即使冷掉也不會太膩口。菜單寫小辣，個人覺得沒什麼辣度，屬於清爽口感的乾拌麵。就連附的海帶芽竹輪湯也很清淡。不過主菜雞腿就醃的很入味了。
小卷咖哩濃湯烏龍麵：有兩隻蠻大的小卷，配料也頗多，只是湯頭偏油，比較偏重口味，且蠻辣的（個人覺得中辣），但菜單上並未表示，如果完全不吃辣的朋友需考慮。另外搭配店家自製的柚子醃蘿蔔，可去油解膩。
明治牛奶冰棒奶茶：已經點了少冰，將冰塊撈出來後奶茶只剩半杯多一點點，而且冰棒都還泡在裡面，喝起來也很清淡，CP值很低。相較之下氣泡飲還稍微好一些，至少味道夠，只是必須趕快喝完，不然久了沒氣泡一樣.....
熱鐵鍋鬆餅：就是嚐鮮嘍∼不是普通的格子鬆餅，反而是將鬆餅做成容器盛裝其他食物，上半部口感較酥，底部類似法式吐司，店員介紹可將鬆餅沾冰淇淋吃，但個人覺得分開吃還比較好，而且最好先把冰淇淋吃完，免得其他食物被泡軟，口感變差。另外鬆餅內的蘋果，完全沒甜也沒蘋果香氣。 -> During the epidemic, there will be no air -conditioning in the store, the seats of the window will be blown by the sea breeze, and the store is also equipped with an electric fan, but friends who are afraid of heat need to think twice.
The time limit for meals is 100 minutes. Even if it is not full in the store, it cannot be extended, so I personally feel that it is not suitable for three or five friends to chat and dinner.
Meal part ~
Switzer -saving hot spring eggs: Stir the entire hot spring egg until the oolong noodles actually have no egg flavor, and the milk flavor will not be too thick, so even if it is cold, it will not be too greasy.The menu is small, and I personally feel that there is no spicy degree, it is a dry noodle with a refreshing taste.Even the supplementary kelp bud bamboo wheel soup is very light.However, the main vegetable chicken legs are marinated.
Small rolls of curry soup oolong noodles: There are two small rolls of small rolls, and there are many ingredients, but the soup is oily, which is more important, and it is quite spicy. If you don't eat spicy friends at all, you need to consider it.In addition, it can be matched with the homemade grapefruit pickled radish, which can remove the greasy greasy.
Meiji milk popsicle milk tea: You have ordered less ice. After the ice cubes are removed, there are only half a little more milk tea, and the popsicles are still soaked in it.In contrast, the bubble drink is slightly better, at least the taste is enough, but it must be drank quickly, otherwise there is no bubbles for a long time ...
Hot Iron Pot Slim: It's early adopters ~ not ordinary plaid muffins, but instead make muffins into containers to dress other foods. The upper part of the texture is crispy, the bottom is similar to French toast. It is better to eat it, but I personally feel that it is better to eat it separately, and it is best to finish the ice cream first, so as not to be softened by other foods, and the taste is worse.In addition, the apple in the muffin is completely sweet or apple aroma at all.

咖啡的部分沒有 Latte 或 Cappuccino ，執著奶類的朋友可以深思。我點了水洗耶加雪菲，朋友點了店內有名的鳳梨系列氣泡飲，夏天感十足。

即使有許多仍須加強的地方
但老闆與店員的熱情和能量足以撐起靠北過日子
假日低消$250/人 服務費10% 蠻高的
飲品約$150-$170 點心約$150-$230

推薦熱鐵鍋德式鬆餅-四季春白蘭地 $230
這是一款屬於大人的鬆餅
帶點焦香的酥脆餅皮（其實蛋香味更是濃郁）
內餡是新鮮的蘋果 奇異果 堅果 果乾
還有一球濃郁茶香的冰淇淋
熱熱酥脆的外皮搭配著冰冰的豐富內餡是幸福的甜點
因鐵鍋非常的燙，所以冰淇淋也融化的特別的快
底層的鬆餅因著熱氣加速吸收了融化的冰淇淋，
如沒有盡快食用完，其實吸滿冰淇淋而軟爛的鬆餅蠻可怕的
（海鹽焦糖的會膩）

黃檸檬蛋糕 $150
類磅蛋糕，比起磅蛋糕，這款蛋糕較為濕潤 清爽，非常濃郁的黃檸檬香氣，以及糖漬的檸檬片（其實個人覺得這片糖漬檸檬太甜了），蛋糕內餡也充滿了檸檬果乾，非常超值真材實料的蛋糕，高CP值

接下來說說飲品部分
特調飲品其實不需要太期待
中規中矩囉.....那整支的鳳梨其實不是很好拍照
不知道是我美感問題還是技術問題
想製作浮誇系飲品的方式其實很多，
但這系列有點....豪邁了！

倒是咖啡（其實我沒點）
下次蠻想嚐嚐看的
因為老闆熱情又專業的介紹給隔壁桌的咖啡感覺很好喝（不知道是老闆的關係還是咖啡真的厲害@@）

可以感覺得出來整間店的風格想要走一個自然 節約能源愛地球\U0001f30d
店員們飆著汗做鐵鍋鬆餅真的辛苦\U0001f4a6

24度的冷氣，35度的空間溫度

二樓靠窗的榻榻米位置
其實位置很棒 風景也很棒
但翻桌率超高（因為超熱）
不知道這是賣點還是翻桌策略
電扇應該放置有冷氣的地方往沒冷氣的地方送才合理對吧！（不然熱氣一直送往有冷氣的地方也只是熱風一直吹而已）
眼看著顧客不悅的向店員抱怨\u22ef\u22ef其實有許多的方式可以改變（兇什麼兇\U0001f43b）

其實最喜歡的是外面的深藍色牆面 -> A comfortable and cute shop
Even if there are many places that still need to be strengthened
But the enthusiasm and energy of the boss and the clerk are enough to support the life of the north
Holidays low -end $ 250/person service fee is 10% high
Drinks about $ 150-$ 170 dim sum, about $ 150- $ 230

Recommended hot iron pot moral muffin-four seasons Chunbailan $ 230
This is a muffin that belongs to adults
Crispy crust with a bit of scorching (Actually, the fragrance of eggs is even more rich)
The filling is fresh apple kiwi nuts dried fruit fruit
There is also a ball of rich tea fragrance ice cream
The hot and crispy skin with the rich filling of the ice is a dessert of happiness
Because the iron pot is very hot, the ice cream is also melted and very fast
The underlying muffin has absorbed the melted ice cream due to the heat gas,
If you do n’t eat it as soon as possible, in fact, it ’s terrible
(The sea salt caramel will be greasy)

Yellow lemon cake $ 150
Pound cake, compared to pound cakes, this cake is more moist and refreshing, very strong yellow lemon aroma, and sugar -stained lemon slices (in fact, I personally think this sugar lemon is too sweet), the cake filling is full Dry fruit, very good value real ingredients, high CP value

Next, talk about the drink part
Special drinks do not need to expect too much
The whole pineapple is not very good to take pictures
I don't know if it is my aesthetics or a technical problem
There are actually many ways to make exaggerated drinks,
But this series is a bit ....

It's coffee (Actually I don't order it)
I want to try it next time
Because the boss is enthusiastic and professional to the coffee at the table next door, it feels delicious (I don’t know if it is the relationship between the boss or the coffee is really powerful @@)

You can feel that the style of the whole store wants to go naturally to save energy and love the earth.
The clerks are sweating to make iron pot muffins really hard \U0001f4a6
The heat of the open kitchen
24 degrees of air -conditioning, 35 degrees of space temperature
I stand at the counter to make an appointment enough to sweat
Tatami position on the second floor
In fact, the position is great and the scenery is also great
But the turnover rate is super high (because of the ultra -heat)
I don't know if this is a selling point or a turning table strategy
The electric fan should be delivered to the place without air -free, right?(Otherwise, the heat has been sent to the place with air -conditioning, it is just the hot air always blows)
Seeing that customers are unhappy to complain to the clerk, in fact, there are many ways to change (what kind of fierceness)

The meal should be changed to a "convenient store -style hot dog platter". The next door is the oolong noodles discussed by the Internet. The price is 290 yuan. Yuan's concept is to see a few broccoli, followed by staple food, indeed a whole small roll. Compared with the Keelung restaurant that came from long, it is a small roll. The small volume of the restaurant is much larger. There are side dishes, lettuce, etc., and small rolls are reduced to add an oolong noodle and a few small flowers.

小卷咖哩烏龍麵，說實話，原本對這並不是很期待，景觀餐廳咩....。但口味說實話有嚇一跳，麵條有夠Q彈，對咖哩湯汁的吸附真是恰到好處，比上週劉山東優秀多了。湯頭咩...就遜，調理包等級。蔬菜跟半顆蛋蛋，中規中矩。這著小卷，唉唷唷，鮮嫩彈牙，一連驚呼三個，好~好~好!! 是料理功夫還是食材好吃已無所謂，這小卷真正好吃，6分。

黃檸檬動動蛋糕，看Google評論說蛋糕不優，嘖嘖。一入口，呵呵，檸檬的果醬跟偏濕的蛋糕本體相當合拍，含在嘴裡慢慢融化還是挺有意思的，雖然感覺還是粗糙了點....整體上算是好吃，不錯，5分。

鳳梨芒果百里香氣泡飲，店員交代兩次要攪拌均勻，我也攪拌了，還是未能查覺其精妙之處。 3分。單杯170元，嗯....吃蛋糕比較實際。

It doesn't matter whether it is cooking or delicious ingredients. This small roll is really delicious, 6 points.

The yellow lemon moves the cake, watch Google commented that the cake is not good, alas.As soon as the entrance, huh, the lemon jam is quite integrated with the wet cake body, and it is very interesting to melt in the mouth slowly. Although it feels rough ... the overall is delicious, good, 5 points.

The pineapple mango fragrance was soaked in the aroma. The clerk explained that it would be stirred twice. I also stirred it. I still couldn't detect its subtleties.3 points.Single cup 170 yuan, um .... It is more practical to eat cakes.

On the whole, if you come to the North Coast to go to the sea to see the sea, there is a good choice after you want to dine here.The restaurant is neat and bright, the layout is interesting, and the position is good.Wen Qing will come.

Slight sea breeze
Gently blow over endless trouble
The mind is reborn
Open the endless space space

Taste and concentrated soup
The mouth is thick and solid
It also hides the seductive charm
Beautiful small volume
The meat is thick and tender and sweet
Soft chicken leg row
The chicken is firm and juicy and juicy
Then with rich ingredients to be used under
Watching as simple as plain food
As soon as it was injected into the power of the God
It makes me taste it and I can't forget the taste
I want to sketch it should be one of my “memories of the taste”

2024-11-21 01:39:35,472 - INFO - 翻譯成功：再訪 Roxy，有種台灣第一批獨立樂團都老了，這間店卻從來沒有衰老的感動。

Roxy 99 和 Rocker 是我充滿青春回憶的地方，很欣慰這第 36 間據點的裝潢和音樂風格都跟那個記憶中的一模一樣——那個在解嚴前獨領風騷、挺過師大夜市抗爭、經歷過幫派圍事的腥風血雨的老 Roxy，竟然還默默存在著，誰敢相信？

現在還可以聽到西洋老搖滾、Disco、Metal 的公共空間真的都不多了，現在的 Roxy 雖然是年輕的大學生居多，這邊的音樂品味還是夠老、夠硬、夠有力！店內的音場也很漂亮，音量如果能再大聲點就完美了。

這陣子回訪發現夜間幾乎天天客滿，很難等到座位，只好懇請那些會拿「遊牧」一詞進行文化挪用的社會菁英高抬貴手，還有很多真正很爵士的「不限時咖啡廳」可以成為辦公淨土，就別被 Roxy “Rock House” 這塊次文化的穢土污染了吧。

我們這些樂迷要的不多，就是一個可以邊大口飲酒邊讓聽覺衝浪的小據點罷了。 -> Visit Roxy again. There is a kind of independent orchestra in Taiwan who are old, but this shop has never been moved by aging.

Roxy 99 and Rocker are where I am full of youthful memories. I am very pleased that the decoration and music style of this 36th stronghold is exactly the same as the memory -the one who led the leader before the strictness, survived the Night Market's fighting, and experienced it. The bloody old Roxy of the gang surrounded by the gang still existed silently. Who dares to believe it?

Now you can also hear the public space of Western Rock, Disco, and Metal. There are really not many public spaces. Although ROXY is mostly young college students now, the music taste here is still old, hard and powerful!The sound field in the store is also very beautiful, and if the volume can be louder, it will be perfect.

This time, I found that it was almost full at night, and it was difficult to wait for the seats. I had to ask those social elites that would take the word "nomadic" to carry out the expensive hands. Pure land, don't be polluted by Roxy "Rock House".

We don't want many fans, that is, a small base that can drink and make hearing surfing while drinking.

餐點無功無過，靠窗戶的位子冷氣非常微弱。
結帳的時候發現店員多點一杯根本沒上過的綠茶，並且在未說明清楚早午餐+53元是附中杯飲料的情況下，擅自幫我們點了大杯飲料，並算了單點的金額。經過溝通後金額有退回，好險有再確認金額。
結帳的時候是刷卡結帳，有開發票，而退款是直接退現金，並未修改發票金額。
live的聲音非常大，一群朋友聚餐的目的是聊天的話，這個場合不適合。live開始後我們講話都用吼的。
供大家參考。

針對店家的回覆：
戴頭巾的服務生顯然無法獨立作業，有一段時間她「一個人」要負責整個外場的點餐、上菜、set桌、進貨、作飲料、結帳，而上餐部分速度之慢，我想內場也有出現類似的問題。
分工的不合理與對員工能力的判斷失誤，與您提及的「墨菲定律」比較起來，店長/主管的問題可能更大，就客人的角度來看只能說自己的招牌是自己砸的。
是人就難免有機會失誤，我們這桌客人也是在理解大家出來工作都很辛苦的情況下，才選擇等你們的餐慢慢上、不惡言相向。但建議下次若有此情形發生，5%服務費就不要收了，服務費是建立在有品質的服務上的。 -> Come to dine on Saturday morning, the earliest three or four tables for coming in.From ordering to the drinking interval of 20 minutes, from ordering to the meal interval for 80 minutes, the waiter asked three or three, and the order of five people only sent three pairs of tableware.The meals of each table for each table are severely delayed.
There is no meal, and the air conditioning of the position of the window is very weak.
During the checkout, I found that the clerk had a more green tea that had not been put on at all, and when the breakfast+53 yuan was the attached middle cup drink, it helped us to order a large cup of drink and calculated the amount of the single order. EssenceAfter the communication, the amount is returned, and the amount of good danger is confirmed.
When checking out, it was swiped to check out, there was an invoice, and the refund was to directly withdraw the cash without modifying the amount of the invoice.
Live's voice is very loud. If a group of friends dinner is to chat, this occasion is not suitable.After Live began, we kept talking.
For your reference.

Reply to the store:
The waiter wearing a headscarf is obviously unable to operate independently. For a while, she was responsible for ordering, serving, SET tables, purchases, drinking, checkout, and the speed of the meal was slow. There are similar problems in the internal field.
The unreasonable division of labor and the judgment of employees' ability to make employees, compared with the "Murphy Law" you mentioned, the problem of the store manager/supervisor may be greater. From the perspective of guests of.
It is inevitable that people will inevitably have a chance to make mistakes. We also choose to wait for your meals to go up slowly and not badly.However, it is recommended that the next situation occur if this situation occurs, and the service fee will not be charged. The service fee is based on quality services.

不過整個用餐體驗感受見仁見智，客人絡繹不絕，動線不良，分工也很雜亂，一進門建議直接去找櫃檯帶位，入座後記得桌號去找門口的小姐點餐，會依照人數給你建議。
由於只有一個點菜小姐，點完菜她要去撈海鮮，接著送單進去櫃檯之類的，又要過一陣子才會出來，因此造成點餐也要大排長龍。用餐畢結帳時要去身兼多職(櫃檯要帶位、結帳、接電話、還要指示送餐的送去哪一桌)的櫃檯排隊，整個用餐下來，如果是第一次來的人又遇到假日，會覺得非常混亂跟擁擠，但也許這種熱鬧的用餐環境跟氛圍，多少也增添了用餐的樂趣。 -> The food is very good. It is different from ordinary hot -fried shops. There are many specialty kung fu dishes. The ingredients are also fresh. The price is not too expensive, and it is acceptable.
However, the whole dining experience is ascendant, the guests are endless, the lines are poor, and the division of labor is also very messy. As soon as I enter the door, I suggest you go to the counter to bring your seat. Remember to order the lady at the door after you enter. Essence
Because there is only one lady ordered, she has to fish seafood after ordering, and then send orders to the counter and the like, and it will not come out for a while, so it will be a long queue for ordering.When you check the meal, you must go to the counter at the counter at the counter (the counter must be brought, checkout, answer the phone, and instruct the meal to send to the table). When people encounter holidays, they will feel very chaotic and crowded, but maybe this lively dining environment and atmosphere also adds the fun of dining.

2024-11-21 01:41:15,635 - INFO - 翻譯成功：第二次來，上次經驗不錯，煎豬肝很好吃但是太鹹，故這次嘗試其他菜色：炒麵、冬瓜排骨酥湯、和墨魚香腸、地瓜葉、劍筍、油雞、脆花滷大腸共五道菜，總共1450，價位很划算，份量不小，兩人來吃已經做好打包帶走的心理準備。整體而言蠻好吃的，不會過鹹，不配白飯吃也沒問題。值得一提的是上菜速度超快，很餓的情況下可以立刻被填飽。

炒麵：看起來好像超太爛的樣子，賣相沒有很好，但是實際吃了口感剛剛好不會太爛，調味剛剛好，被外表誤會了！

冬瓜排骨酥湯：冬瓜似乎是蔭冬瓜，湯色是茶色，剛入口有驚訝，有一種不常喝到的古早味。排骨酥我不喜歡，但是我先生很喜歡。整體而言湯很清甜不死鹹，冬瓜很入味，是一道滿推薦的湯品。

墨魚香腸：炸過的墨魚香腸外酥內軟，附上的蒜頭辣味十足，大人吃了覺得很爽快，小孩子吃一定超愛。

地瓜葉：問了店家知道地瓜葉是用蒜片和米醬下去水炒，不過油不死鹹，因為米醬的關係還帶有一點甜味，地瓜葉本身很嫩，很大一盤。

炒劍筍：劍筍完全沒有太老的部分，一樣有加入米醬下去炒，這道調味非常剛好，單吃不配白飯都很好入口，愛吃劍筍的人很推薦點來嚐嚐。

油雞：是冷的，很有醉雞的口感，很入味很好吃，我們覺得要是路過也會想外帶一份回家吃。

脆花滷大腸：曬乾的白花菜跟大腸一起滷煮，白花菜非常脆，大腸滷得很透也處理得很乾淨，看起來會很鹹很下飯的菜，其實不然，反而比炒劍筍的味道還清淡，小時候阿嬤會煮的菜，好吃的一道菜現在還能吃到覺得很滿足。 -> The second time, the last experience is good, the fried pork liver is delicious but too salty, so this time I try other dishes: fried noodles, melon pork ribs soup, and cuttlefish sausage, sweet potato leaves, sword bamboo shoots, oil chicken, crispy flower halogen, brown flower halogen There are five dishes in the large intestine, with a total of 1450. The price is very cost -effective and the portion is not small.Overall is pretty delicious, it won't be too salty, and it is okay not to eat white rice.It is worth mentioning that the speed of serving is super fast, and when you are hungry, you can be filled immediately.

Fried noodles: It looks super bad. It is not very good for selling, but in fact, it will not be too bad to eat it. The seasoning is just right and misunderstood by the appearance!

Winter melon pork ribs crispy soup: Winter melon seems to be a shade of winter melon, the soup color is tea color, and there is a surprise at the entrance. There is an ancient taste that is not drinking often.I don't like the pork ribs crispy, but my husband likes it very much.On the whole, the soup is very sweet and not dead and salty. Winter melon is very delicious. It is a recommended soup.

Ink fish sausage: The fried cuttlefish sausages are crispy and soft inside, and the attached garlic is full of spicy taste. The adults feel very refreshing when they eat it. Children must love it.

Sweet potato leaves: I asked the store to know that the melon leaves were fried with garlic slices and rice sauce, but the oil was not dead and salty, because the relationship between rice sauce also had a bit of sweetness. The sweet potato leaves were very tender and large.

Fried sword bamboo shoots: The sword bamboo shoots are not too old. They also add rice sauce and stir fry. This seasoning is very good. It is very good to eat or not with white rice. People who love to eat sword bamboo shoots are recommended to taste.

Oil chicken: It is cold, it has a taste of drunk chicken, it is very delicious and delicious. We feel that if you pass by, we will want to take a copy of it.

Crispy flower halogen large intestine: The dried white cauliflower is stewed with the large intestine. The white cauliflower is very crispy, the large intestine is very transparent and handled well. The taste is still light. When I was a kid, I could cook the dishes that Grandma could cook. A delicious dish can still be satisfied.

\u2063
台灣目前盼到微解封，到了常去的金山老街，少部份的餐廳已開放內用，平常到金山老街常經過「兄弟食堂」但從沒進去用餐過，而且以前假日都是人潮，可能剛解封，進去用餐時沒什麼人，而且有用隔板且每一桌也都離很遠，於是就選擇在這用餐了。\u2063
\u2063
以下是當日點的菜色\u2063
\u2063
★石斑魚二吃：魚身用清蒸，魚頭煮薑絲清湯，魚肉鮮度尚可，魚皮厚實膠質多，魚肉也很Q彈，清蒸調味還不錯，但魚頭煮薑絲清湯個人覺得魚的鮮度沒煮出來，薑味不足也無魚味，有點像是開水略失望，而魚是稱重的，記得先詢問一下價格，我們吃的這隻是730元，個人覺得觀光區尚可。\u2063
\u2063
★炒蛤蜊：這道是用九層塔拌炒，鹹甜適中且下飯，算是重口味的一道菜，但個人覺得還不錯吃，也是今天喜歡的一道菜。\u2063
\u2063
★燙大卷：單純燙大卷無其它調味，沾五味醬，鮮度尚可但甜度不足，個人覺得普通，可以跳過。\u2063
\u2063
★炒地瓜葉：個人覺得份量很足，而且很特別是用黃豆豉及大量的大蒜調味火候也足，算是重口味但整個香氣十足也很下飯，是今天感到最滿意的一道菜，而且我們本來是點炒空心菜，結果店員炒錯了，也算是意外的收獲，差點錯過這道美食!\u2063
\u2063
總結~個人覺得快炒類都是重口味的，但覺得都很我口味，反倒是清蒸、清湯、水燙的料理就很普通，不過算是個人還會到訪的餐廳，只是可能就專攻快炒類的，價錢當天結帳以上全部1200元，如果將石斑魚730元扣除，其它三道菜兩碗白飯為470元，其實個人覺得價格也算合理，因為他的為份量也算是比平常快炒店多，下次再來金山會想再試試其它招牌菜!\u2063

Bleak
Taiwan is currently looking forward to the micro -sealed sealed. When it comes to Jinshan Old Street, a small part of restaurants have been used in interior. I usually go through the "Brother Canteen" when I go to Jinshan Old Street, but I have never entered meals. It may be just unblocked. There is no one when I go in to eat, and the useful partitions and each table are far away, so I chose to eat here.Bleak
Bleak
The following is the dish at the day 日
Bleak
★ Stir -grouped fish Er Er: Steamed fish bodies, cooked ginger clear soup with fish head, freshness of fish meat, thick fish skin and thick glue, fish meat is also very q bomb, steamed flavoring is not bad, but the fish head boiled ginger soup soup I personally think that the freshness of the fish is not cooked, the ginger taste is not enough and there is no fish smell. It is a bit disappointed as boiling water, and the fish is weighing. Remember to ask the price first. You can.Bleak
Bleak
★ Stir -fried clams: This is stir -fried with a nine -layer tower. It is salty and sweet and meals. It is a dish with a heavy taste, but I personally think that it is pretty good. It is also a dish that I like today.Bleak
Bleak
★ Big scorching: Simple hot rolls have no other flavor, dipped in Wuxiang sauce, and the freshness is still available but the sweetness is insufficient. I personally think that it is ordinary and can skip it.Bleak
Bleak
★ Frying sweet potato leaves: Personally feel that the portion is sufficient, and it is also very special to season with mockery and a large amount of garlic. It is a heavy taste but the whole aroma is full. It was orderly stir -fry. As a result, the clerk was wrong. It was an unexpected harvest. Almost missed this food! \u2063
Bleak
Summary ~ Personally, I think it ’s heavy -duty fried category, but I think it’ s all of my taste. For the class, the price of the price above is all 1200 yuan. If the grouper 730 yuan is deducted, the other three three dishes and two bowls of rice are 470 yuan. There are many fried restaurants, next time you come to Jinshan again, you will want to try other signature dishes!

「墨魚香腸」烏黑的墨魚香腸切片不僅末魚的香氣十足、口感也相當Q彈，完勝一般的豬肉香腸
「髮菜淋魚捲」魚捲沒有魚肉的口感，卻吃得出滿滿的魚鮮，非常特別
「香煎豬肝」調料類似烤肉醬，太愛吃豬肝的人，這種料理方式完全掩蓋掉腥味，也很下飯
「肝蔭蚵」是以蔥末及醬油快炒，將大海的鮮甜完全鎖在蚵仔內 -> Brother canteen is jointly operated by the three brothers of Guo Hongche, the chef of the gold medal national banquet. Not only is the master's cooking skills, the materials are also particular, and the price is also true. It is often the first choice for the dinner of the local people to dinner at the local people.

"Winter melon pork rib soup" is stewed in the ribs of pork ribs, and the essence is completely in the broth.
The black cut in cuttock sausages "Slice slices of slices of sausage not only have the aroma of the last fish, but also the taste is quite Q bomb.
The "Paea -piping fish roll" fish roll does not have the taste of fish, but it can be full of fresh fish, very special

2022.03.27 好吃到忘了拍照再吃，只拍了兩道菜。
菜都頗有特色，不是制式口味，覺得嘗鮮，頗有記憶點。
過了午間用餐高峰入店，沒等太久。 -> 2023.06.11 The second visit, still a holiday lunch. This time before the lunch peak, remember to take pictures first.It is a pity that this signature dish flavor aroma is slightly retreated with the previous meal. Maybe the meal period is a little later. The pork rib soup and the coconut dry will have more aroma. Sprus, I feel like tomato sauce, a pile of oil on the plate, fortunately, the sausage and chicken did not taste.Because the dishes are a bit unique, you can still try it to go to Jinshan for a long time.This time I did not show the menu, and directly asked for ordering the freezer outside the first floor.

2022.03.27 It ’s delicious and forgot to take pictures before eating, only two dishes.
The vegetables are quite distinctive. They are not the flavor of the system. They feel early and have a memory point.

必點魚捲有四捲之多，地瓜葉軟爛好下飯。可惜我點的三杯田雞在點菜時沒有跟店家溝通清楚，上菜後才發現是鹹酥田雞而不是三杯。後來得知兄弟食堂沒有三杯口味的菜餚，原因是製作過程太「搞剛」（某店員直言相告）...

中規中矩的服務及廚藝表現，是金山區除了鴨肉之外的另一超值選擇！ -> Kingsoft's prestigious old -fashioned restaurant.When I couldn't find other food friends and wanted to taste it, I could only go alone and asked the store to ask the store if there was a single meal.Fortunately, the store entertained the number of guests, and the small dishes will be specified when ordering, so that I can enjoy the signature meal alone.

There are four rolls of fish rolls, and the sweet potato leaves are soft and rotten.Unfortunately, the three cups of fields I ordered did not communicate clearly with the store when they ordered. After the food was served, I found that it was a salty crispy field chicken instead of three cups.Later, I learned that the brothers did not have three cups of dishes for dishes.

雖然今天不夠冷，但大年初二整個萬里金山地區的湯屋幾乎全數客滿。

由於花了太多時間在找湯屋，泡完早已飢腸轆轆，所幸靠google map就近在金山金包里老街附近找了一家4顆星的這家店。

海鮮餐廳的蔥油雞一般來說不抱期望，但這家的真的好吃，我後來要了生辣椒醬油，沾起來更是過癮。

墨魚香腸美味好吃，搭配的生蒜頭給得很大方。
燙蝦子非常棒，蝦子個頭不小，身體緊實，而且就連蝦頭部位的蝦肉蝦膏都飽滿。
清燙透抽新鮮好吃。
炒蛤仔量不少也新鮮，整盤沒有任何碎殼的瑕疵品。
炒空心菜，大推。
冬瓜排骨酥湯非常好喝，店家門口放了超大型蒸籠，就是為了這道點菜率很高的拿手湯品。

以上六菜一湯加一瓶飲料，共1850，真的新鮮好吃又實惠。不過豬肝跟花椰菜乾這兩道店家的招牌菜因為太座不敢吃就沒點了。 -> The first time the mouse was soaked \ufe0f
Although it is not cold enough today, the soup house in the entire Wanli Jinshan area on the second day of the new year is almost full.

Because I spent too much time looking for the soup house, I was already hungry after soaking, but fortunately, I found a 4 -star shop near the old street near Jinshan Jinshan Jinshan Jindao.

The scallion oil chicken in the seafood restaurant is generally not expected, but this one is really delicious. I later asked for raw chili soy sauce, which was even more enjoyable.

The dark sausage is delicious and delicious, and the raw garlic is very generous.
The hot shrimp is very good, the shrimp is not small, the body is firm, and even the shrimp and shrimp paste at the shrimp head are full.
The hot and hot pump is fresh and delicious.
There are a lot of fried clams, and there are no flaws of the whole shell.
Stir -fry the cabbage, push.
Winter melon pork ribs soup is very delicious. There is a large steamer at the door of the store, just for the high -oriented soup with a high order.

The above six dishes and one soup are added with a bottle of drink, a total of 1850, which is really fresh and delicious.However, the signature dishes of the two shops of pork liver and broccoli do not order because they dare not eat too much.

\u2063
台灣目前盼到微解封，到了常去的金山老街，少部份的餐廳已開放內用，平常到金山老街常經過「兄弟食堂」但從沒進去用餐過，而且以前假日都是人潮，可能剛解封，進去用餐時沒什麼人，而且有用隔板且每一桌也都離很遠，於是就選擇在這用餐了。\u2063
\u2063
以下是當日點的菜色\u2063
\u2063
★石斑魚二吃：魚身用清蒸，魚頭煮薑絲清湯，魚肉鮮度尚可，魚皮厚實膠質多，魚肉也很Q彈，清蒸調味還不錯，但魚頭煮薑絲清湯個人覺得魚的鮮度沒煮出來，薑味不足也無魚味，有點像是開水略失望，而魚是稱重的，記得先詢問一下價格，我們吃的這隻是730元，個人覺得觀光區尚可。\u2063
\u2063
★炒蛤蜊：這道是用九層塔拌炒，鹹甜適中且下飯，算是重口味的一道菜，但個人覺得還不錯吃，也是今天喜歡的一道菜。\u2063
\u2063
★燙大卷：單純燙大卷無其它調味，沾五味醬，鮮度尚可但甜度不足，個人覺得普通，可以跳過。\u2063
\u2063
★炒地瓜葉：個人覺得份量很足，而且很特別是用黃豆豉及大量的大蒜調味火候也足，算是重口味但整個香氣十足也很下飯，是今天感到最滿意的一道菜，而且我們本來是點炒空心菜，結果店員炒錯了，也算是意外的收獲，差點錯過這道美食!\u2063
\u2063
總結~個人覺得快炒類都是重口味的，但覺得都很我口味，反倒是清蒸、清湯、水燙的料理就很普通，不過算是個人還會到訪的餐廳，只是可能就專攻快炒類的，價錢當天結帳以上全部1200元，如果將石斑魚730元扣除，其它三道菜兩碗白飯為470元，其實個人覺得價格也算合理，因為他的為份量也算是比平常快炒店多，下次再來金山會想再試試其它招牌菜!\u2063

Bleak
Taiwan is currently looking forward to the micro -sealed sealed. When it comes to Jinshan Old Street, a small part of restaurants have been used in interior. I usually go through the "Brother Canteen" when I go to Jinshan Old Street, but I have never entered meals. It may be just unblocked. There is no one when I go in to eat, and the useful partitions and each table are far away, so I chose to eat here.Bleak
Bleak
The following is the dish at the day 日
Bleak
★ Stir -grouped fish Er Er: Steamed fish bodies, cooked ginger clear soup with fish head, freshness of fish meat, thick fish skin and thick glue, fish meat is also very q bomb, steamed flavoring is not bad, but the fish head boiled ginger soup soup I personally think that the freshness of the fish is not cooked, the ginger taste is not enough and there is no fish smell. It is a bit disappointed as boiling water, and the fish is weighing. Remember to ask the price first. You can.Bleak
Bleak
★ Stir -fried clams: This is stir -fried with a nine -layer tower. It is salty and sweet and meals. It is a dish with a heavy taste, but I personally think that it is pretty good. It is also a dish that I like today.Bleak
Bleak
★ Big scorching: Simple hot rolls have no other flavor, dipped in Wuxiang sauce, and the freshness is still available but the sweetness is insufficient. I personally think that it is ordinary and can skip it.Bleak
Bleak
★ Frying sweet potato leaves: Personally feel that the portion is sufficient, and it is also very special to season with mockery and a large amount of garlic. It is a heavy taste but the whole aroma is full. It was orderly stir -fry. As a result, the clerk was wrong. It was an unexpected harvest. Almost missed this food! \u2063
Bleak
Summary ~ Personally, I think it ’s heavy -duty fried category, but I think it’ s all of my taste. For the class, the price of the price above is all 1200 yuan. If the grouper 730 yuan is deducted, the other three three dishes and two bowls of rice are 470 yuan. There are many fried restaurants, next time you come to Jinshan again, you will want to try other signature dishes!

\U0001f539墨魚香腸
首先我必須要說，這不是真的香腸\U0001f923，應該只是把魷魚、魚漿和墨汁做成香腸的形狀而已，吃起來像高雄常見的炸黑輪，酥酥的
\U0001f539脆花大腸
大腸就是一般的滷大腸，口感比較軟，不是Q彈的那種，脆花是花椰菜乾，吃起來很像筍乾，但是又沒有筍乾那麼會吸收湯汁，常常吸了滷汁變得太鹹太軟，花椰菜保留本身脆脆的口感，並且不會太鹹，超喜歡這道菜\U0001f929
\U0001f539髮菜魚卷
吃起來就是，有點像蝦捲，有蝦仁、魚肉，還不錯，只是荸薺（？）感覺有點太多

\u2b50店裡有提供白開水（飲水機 -> It's very fast to serve \U0001f44d

First of all, I have to say that this is not a real sausage sausage. It should just make squid, fish pulp and ink into the shape of sausage. It tastes like a common fried black wheel in Kaohsiung, crispy
Crispy flower large intestine
The large intestine is a general marinated large intestine, and the taste is relatively soft. It is not the type of Q bomb. The crispy flower is dried broccoli. It tastes like dried bamboo shoots, but it will absorb the soup like dried bamboo shoots. Salt is too soft, cauliflower retains its own crispy taste, and it will not be too salty, so I like this dish \U0001f929
\U0001f539 \U0001f539 \U0001f539 \U0001f539 \U0001f539

When I went in, they pushed me a menu without price label.When I pay for the menu core when paying, they hurriedly showed me a menu without price label because I don't understand English.I have to pay more than 50,000 won for 5 menu items.

No menu indicates the price.Whenever you order, just write down the name and price.I have no idea.You don't know that this is a real and accurate price.When you say that you can see the price on the menu, the staff just says that there is a boss.that's all.It's terrible.Don't come to this restaurant.

服務就是一般喝茶聊天的店會有的規格，可以說沒有很好但該有的也不會少。
氣氛不是說很好，主要是整體裝潢風格不一，每個區塊都會相衝突，但會來這裡的人多半也不太會在意這些所以OK的。

優點是方便快速，座位組合其實滿多的，很多人一起來的話也是有大桌可以一起坐，這點很多店家都比不上。
當然停車位也不用擔心，門口位子雖然不多，不過後面停車場超大，完全不用擔心車位問題。

給素食者的建議，如果肚子很餓可以考慮，真的滿方便的，素食鍋不難吃但一鍋330其實不便宜。如果有其他計畫的話建議按照您本身計畫就好了。 -> After ordering a vegetarian hot pot, first of all, thank you for the dining needs of vegetarians.
Services are the specifications of general tea and chat shops. It can be said that there are no good but not less.
The atmosphere is not good, mainly because the overall decoration style is different. Each block will conflict, but most people who come here do not care about these so OK.

The advantage is that it is convenient and fast. There are actually a lot of seat combinations. If many people come together, there are large tables to sit together. Many stores cannot compare.
Of course, don't worry about parking spaces. Although there are not many seats at the door, the parking lot is large in the back, so there is no need to worry about parking space problems.

Suggestions for vegetarians, if you are hungry, you can consider it. It is really convenient. The vegetarian pot is not difficult to eat but a pot of 330 is actually not cheap.If there are other plans, it is recommended to follow your own plan.

真的是一個不愉快的用餐經驗！ \U0001f624\U0001f624\U0001f624

今天下著毛毛細雨，剛好看到店家的停車場就在門口，就繞進來用餐，我們大約 11 點到，是第一組客人，我們當然是背著咪咪就進門，店員拿了菜單跟我們說，有空位都可以坐，就這樣~我們坐下來點餐，點了~

黑胡椒鐵板牛 ~ 300 元
三杯雞飯 ~ 300 元
炸物拼盤 ~ 200 元
熱紅茶 ~ 簡餐附贈的
焦糖拿鐵 ~ 185 元 （有點套餐，只需付半價）

在我們吃完簡餐的飯類，員工來收盤子的時候，她突然看到袋子裡的咪咪，她馬上說~“這裡禁止寵物，現在把她帶去車上”，我愣住了！ 我們的炸物和飲料已經端上著，但都還沒吃，她又重複了一次~  “ 現在先把貓咪帶去車上！” ， 天啊！！ 現在的寵物都是家裡的一份子，尤其會帶著一起出門的，絕對是把寵物當小孩，如何能把咪咪丟在車上，我們再繼續坐著吃飯呢？還有~ 貓咪也是有生命，可以把她關在車上嗎？ 還是我們必須先發動引擎，好讓車內有空氣？當然~我們請她幫我們把東西打包，結帳後就離開了！

首先~ 我們絕對尊重店家禁止寵物，但門口的標示真的很不清楚，我們並不是明知故犯，偷偷帶咪咪進來，要不然我們就不會正大光明的把咪咪放在椅子上了！

其實~ 店家的用餐環境真的蠻舒適的，每個座位都是沙發座椅，而且座位與座位都有一定距離，餐點雖然不是會令人稱讚的美味，但以 300 元來說，就是一般平價簡餐，是個蠻適合家人朋友聚餐聊天的地方

只是今天員工的處理方式著實有不妥之處，當時旁邊都沒其他客人，咪咪也沒跑出背袋，乖乖地趴在裡面，應該可以跟我們說~“這裡禁止寵物，麻煩確定不要讓貓咪跑出來！”  ， 我想~ 她如果這麼說，我們也是會趕緊吃完離開，而不是叫我們馬上把寵物帶出去，我們又不是犯法，沒必要這麼嚴厲的執行吧？這樣擺明就是趕我們走啊！

這裡真心給店家一個建議，如果你們真的那麼嚴格執行禁止寵物，就應該在門口做個超明顯的“ 禁止寵物”標語， 或是請員工在每組客人進門的時候都先檢查是不是有帶寵物，這樣才不會造成不必要的糾紛 -> 2022/12/21 Come to dine:

It's really an unpleasant dining experience!Bleak

Today, there was a drizzle of Maomao. I just saw that the parking lot of the store was at the door, and we came in to dine. We arrived at about 11 o'clock. It was the first group of guests. Of course, we entered the door with Mimi. Said, you can sit in a vacant position, just like this ~ Let's sit down and order, or order ~

Black pepper iron plate beef ~ 300 yuan
Three cups of chicken rice ~ 300 yuan
Fried Material Pack ~ 200 yuan
Hot black tea ~ Jane meal comes with
Caramel latte ~ 185 yuan (there is a little package, just pay half price)

When we finished eating the meal, when the employee came to close the market, she suddenly saw Mimi in the bag. She immediately said ~ "Pets are prohibited here, and now he takes her to the car." I stunned!Our fried objects and beverages are already on the end, but have not eaten yet, she repeated it again ~ "Now bring the cat to the car!", Oh my god!IntersectionNowadays, pets are part of the family. Especially when they go out, they will definitely use pets as children. How can we throw Mimi in the car and we continue to sit and eat?Also ~ Cats also have life, can I put her in the car?Or do we have to start the engine first so that there is air in the car?Of course ~ We invite her to help us pack things and leave after checkout!

First of all, we absolutely respect the store forbidden pets, but the labeling at the door is really unclear. We are not knowing that they are criminals and secretly come in with Mimi secretly, otherwise we will not put Mimi on the chair!

In fact, the dining environment of the store is really comfortable. Each seat is a sofa seat, and the seat and the seat have a certain distance. Although the meal is not praised, for 300 yuan, it is generally generally. A cheap meal is a place that is pretty suitable for family and friends to eat and chat

But today the employee's handling method is really inappropriate. At that time, there were no other guests next to them, and Mimi did not run out of a back bag. Lying obediently, you should be able to say to us ~ "Pets are prohibited here, please be sure not to let let you let let's not let let Cat runs ", I think ~ If she said so, we will also eat and leave quickly, instead of asking us to take the pets out immediately.This way it is clear is to drive us away!

Here I really give the store a suggestion. If you really implement the ban on pets, you should make an ultra -obvious "prohibited pet" slogan at the door, or ask employees to check whether there is a belt when each group of guests enter the door. Pets, this will not cause unnecessary disputes

The next time I will order again. In the case of hot milk tea, it is a black tea bag+another cream ball.

2024-11-21 01:44:16,365 - INFO - 翻譯成功：用餐：
今天(1/5)吃羊肉爐火鍋個人覺得沒那麼好吃，羊肉蠻小塊，感覺是從冷凍拿出來的，不好咀嚼且骨肉是黏在一起的。另外沾醬很普通，很像放很久的豆腐乳。旁邊的菜盤則是我去吃羊肉爐火鍋不會夾的配菜，我個人覺得跟羊肉爐不搭。
但之前吃其他的品項還不錯，像是一般的什錦火鍋、簡餐系列、甜品、飲料都值得試試。但整體價位都很高，CP值略低。

服務品質：
服務生很溫柔，一進門會問有幾位用餐，會建議可以坐哪裡。吃完後也會主動收拾餐盤，還可以繼續坐著聊天。

環境：
佔地蠻大的，後面還有庭院可以出去走走。廁所看起來也很乾淨。

停車：
餐廳前有非常大的停車場可以停，不用擔心沒有地方停車或要到很遠的地方。 -> Meal:
Today (1/5) eating lamb stove hot pot personally, I don't think it is so delicious. The mutton is quite small. It feels like it is taken out of frozen.In addition, the dipping sauce is very ordinary, it is very similar to the long -put tofu milk.The dish next to me is the side dishes that I eat lamb stove hot pot. I personally feel that it is not matched with the lamb stove.
But eating other items before is not bad, such as ordinary assorted hot pot, simple meal series, desserts, and drinks are worth trying.But the overall price is very high, and the CP value is slightly lower.

Service quality:
The waiter is very gentle. As soon as you enter the door, you will ask several meals, and you will recommend where to sit.After eating, you will also take the initiative to clean up the plate, and you can continue to sit and chat.

environment:
Occupy the area is quite large, and there is a courtyard to go out.The toilet looks clean.

parking:
There are very large parking lots in front of the restaurant to stop. Don't worry about no place to park or go far.

10/8今日下午第一次到這用餐
服務人員很多，但一進門卻沒有服務員接待
開口詢問要如何點餐？
但服務員只忙著電腦上的點餐（完全忽略我）
後來看到我一直盯著她看，才開口說話
說自己挑選座位，點餐畫單拿來櫃檯即可

我就帶著家人挑了座位，畫單好了之後將單子親自拿到櫃檯，但是一樣完全沒有服務員要理我\u22ef後來一位男服務員要準備推餐去送餐看到我拿著單子，才開口說單子給他，還確認完餐點是什麼之後就說可以了

我就與家人在座位上等了超過半個小時以上
沒錯！！就是超過半小時的空等\u22ef
看到比我們晚進來的其他桌客人都已經上餐完畢了，我們居然還沒送任何一道餐過來

我起身走到櫃檯，還是一樣沒有人願意搭話
我主動詢問之後，服務員居然從廚房前的桌上拿起我的畫單，問我是不是這張？
我說就是這張，到底開始做餐了沒？
居然才跟我說抱歉，會馬上先出
這根本是直接忽略我的單子了吧？！
居然可以直接放在桌上忽視客人的單
那位男服務員也從頭到尾不過來跟我解釋
甚至店家為什麼單子是直接放在桌上而沒有製作？也沒有任何人過來解釋或道歉？

如果這家店的服務態度永遠是這樣，那我相信之後應該完全沒有任何人敢來這裡消費吧
（真是有夠誇張的扯） -> This restaurant is not recommended at all!IntersectionIntersection
10/8 the first time I arrived here today in the afternoon
There are a lot of service staff, but there is no waiter for reception as soon as I enter the door
Ask how to order food?
But the waiter is busy ordering on the computer (completely ignore me)
Later, I saw that I kept staring at her before I spoke
Say you choose your seat, order the table to take the counter to the counter

I took my family with my family. After the drawing list, I took the list to the counter in person, but there was no waiter who had to ignore me at all. Later, a male waiter had to push meals to send meals to see me holding the order before I took the order before I took the order before I took the order. I said that the order was given to him, and I said it was okay after confirming what the meal was.

I have waited for more than half an hour with my family on my seat for more than half an hour
That's right!IntersectionEmpty over half an hour ...
Seeing that the other tables we came in late have been completed, and we haven't given any meals yet.

I got up and walked to the counter, and I still didn't want to talk
After I took the initiative, the waiter actually picked up my painting list from the table in front of the kitchen and asked me if I was?
I said it was this one. Has I started meals?
I actually told me sorry, I will come out immediately
This is simply ignoring my list, right?Intersection
You can actually put it directly on the table to ignore the guest's list
The male waiter also explained to me from beginning to end
Why did the store just put it on the table and did not make it?No one came to explain or apologize?

If the service attitude of this store is always like this, then I believe that no one dares to come here to consume it.

但以這樣價位已經算很不錯 -> The meal is delicious, recommended pork chop and chicken leg rice
