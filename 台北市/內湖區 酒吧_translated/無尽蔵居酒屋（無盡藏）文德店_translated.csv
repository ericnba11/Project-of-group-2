"因為住附近，來過好幾次
餐點部分非常用心，烤物、炸物、生食手捲都有一定的水準
像是明太子手羽先、雞肉三兄弟、炸蝦天婦羅、炙燒握壽司.....等，都蠻不錯，也有自己的風味特色

幾個我個人口味稍微較不喜歡的是炒烏龍麵，以及部分炒青菜會加銀杏豆、大阪燒的美乃滋偏多，這幾款我個人會稍微避開
生魚片的話，這邊是屬於用鮮魚，口感較濕潤（我個人比較喜歡有熟成過、口感較乾爽的）

如果是在一樓座位區，座椅有點偏高，坐久會較不舒服，窗邊屬於吸菸區、門口也會有客人抽菸，這個如果介意的人應該會較敏感","Because I live nearby, I have been here several times
The meal part is very attentive, and the roasted objects, fried objects, and raw food rolls have a certain level
Such as the Prince Ming Shou Yu Xian, the three brothers of chicken, fried shrimp tempura, burning sushi ..... and so on, are pretty good, and have their own flavor characteristics

Several of my personal taste is slightly less like -like, fried oolong noodles, and some fried vegetables will add ginkgo beans, and Osaka -roasted Misono. I personally avoid it.
For sashimi, it belongs to fresh fish here, and the taste is more humid (I personally prefer to be familiar and dry)

If it is in the seat area on the first floor, the seat is a bit high, and it will be uncomfortable to sit for a long time. There will be guests smoking at the door of the window and the door."
"餐點：熱炒水蓮很好吃
串烤：真的還好
涼伴：芥末章魚🐙很不錯
**酒** :可能住宅區 酒類偏少 偏貴 清酒種類少 但老闆有自己的堅持（什麼清酒 只能喝溫的）這點我很欣賞 有職人的專業
❗️❗️我對居酒屋的重點❗️❗️
環境：我很喜歡 如果你也愛慢步調的喝酒 放鬆 我真的很喜歡💕👍","Meal: Hot fried water lotus is delicious
Skewed roasting: really okay
Liangyan: The mustard octopus 🐙 is very good
** Wine **: Maybe there are fewer alcohol in the residential area, and there are few types of sake, but the boss has his own insistence (what can sake can only drink warm).
酒️❗️ My focus on izakaya ❗️❗️
Environment: I like it very much. If you also like to drink slowly, I really like it."
"空間大，餐點好吃！
推炸南瓜！生啤只有海尼根，比較遺憾。","The space is large and the meals are delicious!
Fry the pumpkin!The only beer is Heinen, which is even more regrettable."
"整體很棒，串燒水準以上，炸南瓜很好吃，烤蔬菜的部分比較乾一些。
環境氣氛不錯，可惜門口室外座位可以抽煙，偶爾會有煙味飄入。","The overall is great, the skewers are above the level, fried pumpkin is delicious, and the part of the roasted vegetables is more dry.
The atmosphere of the environment is good. Unfortunately, the outdoor seat at the door can smoke, and occasionally there will be smoke."
東西還蠻好吃，出菜速度不快（用餐時幾乎客滿），但出餐的品質都還不錯，可惜當日去黑鮪魚已經沒了。啤酒品質可以。餐點價格稍高，可以刷卡。,"Things are quite delicious, the speed of dishes is not fast (almost full of meals), but the quality of the meal is not bad. Unfortunately, the black catfish was gone on the same day.Beer quality is OK.The price of meals is slightly higher, and you can swipe your card."
其實已經到訪很多次，不過疫情解封後還沒去過，那天去吃晚餐才發現！生意也太好了吧！第一次坐到二樓，串燒很好吃！,"In fact, I have visited many times, but I haven't been there after the epidemic unsealed. I discovered dinner that day!The business is too good!Sit on the second floor for the first time, and the skewers are delicious!"
"頭一回去，就遇上內場的服務小姐態度不太友善，不知道是不是當天剛好心情不好...另外就是沒有服務鈴，我和朋友坐在二樓，感覺非常不方便! 希望店家可以考慮增加該設備，會提升不少用餐品質。
餐點部份沒有特別令人驚豔的部份，口味普普，但每家居酒屋總是得有個特色餐點，個人覺得冷泡茶倒是還不錯，喝了好幾瓶。
BTW 當晚結帳時，被多算了一道菜錢，感覺店家處理的很不乾脆...","When I went back in the first time, I was not very friendly to the lady in the insiders. I do n’t know if I was in a bad mood that day ... In addition, I did n’t have a service bell. My friend and I sat on the second floor. I felt very inconvenient! You can consider increasing the equipment, which will improve a lot of dining quality.
There is no particularly stunning part of the meal part, the taste is Pop, but the izakaya always has a special meal. I personally think that cold tea is pretty good and drink several bottles.
When BTW was at the checkout of the night, I was calculated one more vegetable. I felt that the store did not handle it ..."
"超有氛圍的居酒屋🏮
尤其坐窗邊超有氣氛😍
雖然有些菜餚價格偏高
但口感確實有這價值
所以個人覺得CP值是有的☺️
店員也很健談😆👍","Izakaya with an atmosphere 围
Especially sitting on the window is super atmosphere 😍
Although some dishes are high in price
But the taste does have this value
So I personally think that the CP value is available ☺️
The clerk is also very talkative"
"整體價格偏貴,三串雞肉串就要300元有點嚇到，串燒都是一串的價格，點下來不便宜而且份量少。
食物偏涼,可能坐在二樓送上來路途遙遠都冷掉了,吃的不是很開心,建議店家做一個送餐電梯,不然天氣冷吃到一堆涼掉的食物心情真的很差,加上價格又貴，一個人吃1000元還吃不飽,這邊適合喝酒點一些下酒菜就好不適合去用餐。","The overall price is expensive. The three skewers of the three skewers are 300 yuan. It is a bit scared. The skewers are a string of prices. It is not cheap and the portion is small.
The food is cool, and maybe sitting on the second floor and sending the road is far away. It is not very happy to eat. It is recommended that the store make a food delivery elevator. The price is expensive, and it is not enough to eat 1,000 yuan alone. It is not suitable for drinking some wine and vegetables here."
母親節聚餐來到文德店，串燒、海鮮等料理都很好吃，二樓有12人的包廂，適合聚會的場所。一樓有開放空間的座位喔。,"Mother's Day dinner came to Wende Store. The skewers, seafood and other dishes were delicious. There were 12 people on the second floor, which was suitable for places where the party.There are open spaces on the first floor."
常常來 好喝的梅酒 好吃的串燒,I often come to delicious plum wine delicious skewers
"居酒屋
嚐試兩次～少了居酒屋的氛圍。
比較像居酒屋台式沒有氛圍版。
但也不是爛，應該說跟其他小店面的
比較起來空間較大 少了聚焦點。","Izakaya
Try twice ~ less atmosphere of izakaya.
There is no atmosphere version like izakaya.
But it's not bad, it should be said that with other small stores
In comparison, there is a lot of space."
多次造訪，適合朋友聚餐小酌的居酒屋，食物中等，氣氛百分 ：）,"Multiple visits, the izakaya suitable for friends to dinner, the food is medium, the atmosphere is percentage :)"
炒水蓮鑊氣超讚！！！看到評論說大阪燒美乃滋比較多所以點餐時有說美乃滋要少一點，覺得好吃！外皮超脆！！！老闆人很親切～,"Stir -fried lotus lotus is superb!IntersectionIntersectionSeeing comments said that there are more in Osaka Boomis, so when ordering meals, I said that Mineri should be less and feel delicious!The outer skin is super crispy!IntersectionIntersectionThe boss is very kind ~"
"飲料：啤酒好喝
餐點：烤雞軟骨大推
服務：漂亮妹妹會主動推薦搭配，對有選擇障礙的客人，這服務超貼心。
地點：鄰近公園，離捷運文湖線《文德站》或《港墘站》，步行距離適中。","Drink: Beer is delicious
Meal: Big boiled chicken cartilage push
Service: Beautiful sister will actively recommend matching. For customers with obstacles, this service is super intimate.
Location: Near the park, ""Wende Station"" or ""Hong Kong Tong"" from the MRT Wenhu Line, the walking distance is moderate."
這間居酒屋真的讓人為之驚艷。 他們的料理尤其美味，每道菜都讓我驚喜連連。 非常推薦他們的生魚片，鮮甜可口!!😋 除了食物，這裡的服務品質超讚👍~員工態度親切且熱情，從進門到離開整個用餐體驗都非常愉快。 這家餐廳的裝潢也很舒適，環境整潔且寬敞，非常適合和家人或朋友一起聚餐。 總而言之，這是一家非常值得推薦的居酒屋。❤,"This izakaya is really amazing.Their dishes are particularly delicious, and every dish makes me surprise.It is very recommended for their sashimi, fresh and delicious !! In addition to food, the quality of service here is superb. The employee attitude is kind and enthusiastic. It is very pleasant to go from entering the door to leaving the entire dining experience.The decoration of this restaurant is also very comfortable, the environment is neat and spacious, and it is very suitable for dinner with family or friends.All in all, this is a very recommended izakaya.❤"
內科下班後適合聚餐的居酒屋，當天的餐點都還不錯，唯有芥末章魚不太符合個人口味（覺得有種魷魚乾的味道～？）不喜歡煙味的可以選擇二樓的座位～,"The izakaya that is suitable for dinner after work after get off work. The meals that day are not bad. Only the mustard octopus is not in line with personal taste (think there is a kind of dry squid ~?) If you don't like the smoke flavor, you can choose the seat on the second floor ~"
"2023/2/5 晚上6:30一人用餐

菜單上雖然沒有寫烤飯糰
但品名“鮭魚御飯糰”確實是用烤的
外皮極脆，內在偏硬
放入味增湯剛剛好
口味以居酒屋來說偏淡
鮭魚則是散狀分佈於各處
一顆六十的價格我認為很可以
另外激推青龍牛肉串！
味增湯則是淡了些，個人沒有很推

結帳時可以免費拿取店家火柴盒
已經越來越少見了，很不錯

P.S 服務人員很親切問我
有沒有吃飽？要不要借你傘？很加分","2023/2/5 5 pm at 6:30 per person for meal

Although the menu is not written on a grilled rice ball
But the name ""salmon royal rice ball"" is indeed grilled
The skin is crispy, and the inside is hard
Put it in Lishe Tang just right
The taste is lighter than izakaya
Salmon is scattered all over the place
I think it is okay for a sixty price
Also push green dragon beef skewers!
Weizhi Deco

You can get the shop's match box for free at checkout
It's getting rare, very good

P.S service staff asked me very kindly
Are there any full food?Do you want to borrow your umbrella?Very bonus"
"串燒真的不行！！
不是烤太乾就是沒味道，醬烤無骨牛小排還得沾楜椒鹽才好入口，否則只有「牛味」而已。 塩烤豬肉蔥串的肉片太薄，以致包裹在外的肉片變成肉乾，真是母湯。

炸蝦天婦羅的麵衣偏硬影響口感，倒是酥炸雞軟骨及日式炒烏龍挺好吃的。

整體而言，餐點口味與定價不成比例，上菜速度極慢，綜合以上我覺得「醉燈食居」略勝一籌。

✅可刷卡","Skewers are really not good!Intersection
It is either grilled too dry or tasteless. The baked beef steak of the sauce must be dipped in salt and salt, otherwise it will only be ""beef flavor"".The meat skewers of roasted pork onion are too thin, so that the meat wrapped in the outside becomes jerky, it is really a mother soup.

The fried shrimp's tempura's noodles have hardly affected the taste, but it is delicious.

On the whole, the taste of meals is not proportional to pricing, and the speed of serving is extremely slow. Based on the above, I think the ""drunk lamp food"" is slightly better.

✅ ✅ ✅ ✅"
"每道料理都美味
尤其是一夜干，平常是不會點來吃的
但無盡藏烤的的非常美味，鮮嫩多汁👍","Every dish is delicious
Especially when it is done overnight, I usually don't order it to eat

"酒讚，食物美味，價格偏高，帳單嚇到。
當天我們四人入座，因為有人是常客所以我們便按她平常的喜好點，但沒有想說吃飽的價位有點偏高，但瑕不掩瑜，整體來說店裡的氣氛、裝潢還有提供的服務品質都符合他的價位喔","Jiuzan, the food is delicious, the price is high, and the bill is scared.

"窗台邊的居酒屋🏮很喜歡隨意戶外的座位區

炒水蓮、唐揚雞、胡麻山藥沙拉
干貝培根串、蔥雞串、酒蒸蛤蜊

最推薦胡麻山藥沙拉跟酒蒸蛤蜊👍🏻
菜單很多特別別家沒有的 下次會再訪！","Izakaya beside the window sill likes to outdoor seats at random outdoors

Stir -fried lotus lotus, Tang Yang chicken, vermiculite yam salad
Dry Berlon skewers, green onion chicken skewers, wine steamed clams

"外圍的吧檯區很棒很適合聊天聚會
東西不錯而且好吃
很棒的地方👍👍👍👍","The outer bar area is great, very suitable for chat party
Good and delicious
Great place 的"
環境很不錯很悠閒，不過東西價位真的偏高，份量也偏小。當天還遇到超大蟑螂，店家有幫我們殺掉，畢竟開放空間難免，但還是嚇到一聲冷汗😂 …,"The environment is very good and leisurely, but the price of east to west is really high and the portion is small.I also encountered a large cockroach that day. The store helped us kill. After all, the open space is inevitable, but still scared a cold sweat ..."
相當不錯的一次晚餐體驗，一間有著日式居酒屋風情的餐廳，而且名稱也相當特別；進到店中，會先被一排的清酒瓶牆面所吸引，也是最大客容量的一桌，其次有著吧台區、對外桌區及二樓的客桌區，當天點了痛風鍋及一些燒物，痛風鍋內有大量的蛤蠣及蝦子，還有牡蠣及花枝等，兩個人吃相當足夠，而燒物上包著明太子的雞翅，鹹淡適中，外表烤得有點脆口，另外雞肉與牛小排也是軟嫩多汁而不硬；美中不足的是餐廳並無禁菸，如果坐在下風處享用美食，真的有點不太舒服。,"A pretty good dinner experience, a restaurant with Japanese -style izakaya, and the name is quite special; when you enter the store, you will be attracted by a row of sake bottle walls. With the bar area, the outer desk area and the guest table area on the second floor. On the same day, the gout cooker and some roasted items were ordered. There were a large amount of oysters and shrimp in the gout pan, as well as oysters and flower branches. The roast is covered with the chicken wings of the prince, the salty is moderate, and the appearance is a bit crispy. It's really a bit uncomfortable."
"內湖地區下班 喝兩杯放鬆的好地方
店家的烤物尤其在水準之上 值得推薦
日式小菜偶有佳作

1樓 半開放式的座位規劃
很適合人少聊天 輕鬆的喝酒

價格不算便宜 食量大 酒量大 慎入","Drink two glasses of relaxation in the Neihu area to relax and relax

"2021.01.11

📍吃的部分📍

😋好吃推薦：整體來說口味都蠻好的，居酒屋的價格都蠻高的就不用說了，我會特別推薦🐷味噌松阪豬及🐷炭烤鹹豬肉，兩個搭配上洋蔥跟蒜苗，味道都很棒；串燒的部分推薦🐂醬燒無骨牛

🍹好喝推薦：這次我們喝了🍸梅子酒跟🍑桃子酒，第一杯喝桃子，我們全部都以為是梅子，喝到梅子再回去喝桃子，桃子味就出來了，很神奇😂，這兩種酒都蠻推薦了，比附近的雷鳥的酒好喝，份量感覺也比較多

👍CP值推薦：大家都知道居酒屋的價格都偏高，這間的CP值推薦會頒給🐔酥炸雞腿肉，180元份量很不錯，味道也好吃

‼️不太推薦：如果再訪我可能不會再點綜合握壽司，有某種肉是比鮭魚好吃（可以看相片說明），但平均一貫要60元以上，對我來說價值沒那麼高；另外是麻糬燒的部分，我覺得我真的不能理解這種日式的米團子🍡，之前在日本也吃過，我真的吃不出他的美味😂

📍環境的部分📍

一樓是吸煙區，沒有吸菸的會直接帶二樓，如果對煙味很敏感，建議可以往裡面坐一點，我們這次坐樓梯上來的第一個位置，我先生說過程中有聞到煙味

我們是平日晚上去的，沒什麼人，環境蠻舒適，也不會吵雜，可以很自在的聊天，這是我蠻喜歡部分

⭐️總結⭐️

推薦內湖的上班族，下班後可以跟同事來小聚，是個適合聊天的環境，如果要吃飽的話，我們三個人，平均一個人花了快900元，是不便宜的消費，偶爾吃一次我認為很ok！","2021.01.11

📍 📍 部分 部分 部分

来 Recommended: Overall, the taste is pretty good. Needless to say, the price of izakaya is quite high. I will recommend 🐷 味 😋 😋 😋 😋 😋 and charcoal grilled salted pork. It's great; the skewers are recommended to burn the boneless beef

我们 🍹 🍹 🍹: This time we drank 🍸 plum wine and peach wine. The first glass of peaches, we all thought it was plum. When we drank the plum, I went back to drink the peach, and the peach flavor came out. Both wines are quite recommended, which is better than nearby Thunderbird's wine, and the portion feels more.

大家CP value recommendation: Everyone knows that the price of izakaya is high. This CP value recommendation will be awarded to the fried fried chicken legs. The amount of 180 yuan is very good, and the taste is delicious.

Bleak️ Not very recommended: If you visit again, I may not order a comprehensive sushi again. Some kinds of meat is delicious than salmon (you can see photos instructions), but the average consistent is more than 60 yuan. In addition, it is the part of Matsuka, I really can't understand this Japanese -style rice dumplings. I have eaten it in Japan before. I really can’t eat his deliciousness.

📍 The environment of the environment 部分

The first floor is a smoking area. If there is no smoking, you will bring the second floor directly. If it is sensitive to the smell of smoke, it is recommended to sit in a little. The first position on the stairs this time. taste

We went on weekdays and night. No one, the environment is quite comfortable, and it will not be noisy. I can chat very freely. This is what I like.

⭐️ Summary ️️

I recommend office workers in Neihu. After work, you can get together with colleagues. It is an environment suitable for chatting. If you want to eat, the three of us spend an average of 900 yuan. I think it's OK!"

"串物部分覺得略顯普通
明太子雞肉跟鹽雞肉都吃起來很嫩
松阪豬肉質偏硬，個人不愛
洋蔥串還不錯，配上奶油一起烤，口感比單吃的洋蔥串好很多
牛肋部分⋯⋯牛肉很老，可能是肉本身的問題，配上炒過的蒜粒很特別，但是蒜粒的部分也沒有很好吃⋯有點可惜
海鮮大阪燒的部分，因為要小火煎，所以等滿久的
但吃起來的口感有點像壓扁的章魚燒，上下兩面焦焦脆脆的口感很好，中間像麵糊口感不愛，料滿少的
竹輪的部分吃起來口感還好，沒有什麼特別，可能食材本身不適合串烤
整體串物來說其實覺得滿普通，可能店裡的特色是其他的，主要是吃串為主
建議前往的客人可以試試其他料理，或許令人驚艷
整體消費落在中上價位，不算便宜的居酒屋","The string part feels slightly ordinary
Ming prince chicken and salt chicken taste tender
Matsusaka pork is hard, I don’t love personally
The onion skewers are pretty good. It is grilled with cream, and the taste is much better than the onion skewers alone.
The beef ribs are very old. It may be the problem of the meat itself. It is very special with fried garlic grains, but the garlic particle is not delicious. Unfortunately
The part of the seafood Osaka is fried because it should be fried in low heat, so wait for a long time
But the taste is a bit like a flat octopus burning. The burnt and crispy taste of the upper and lower sides is very good. The middle is like a batter and does not love it.
The part of the bamboo wheel tastes good, there is nothing special, maybe the ingredient itself is not suitable for skewers
In fact, the overall string is full of ordinary, maybe the characteristics in the store are other, mainly because they are mainly eaten.
It is recommended to try other dishes, which may be amazing
The overall consumption falls at the middle and upper price, not a cheap izakaya"
第一次本來是這間店的裝潢吸引，很少能看到這種裝潢類型的居酒屋，非常喜歡，食物很好吃，老闆帥，店長美（真的😍），服務超級無敵好，氣氛也超好，應該是會無止盡繼續來這裡，五顆星不給不行了,"The first time it was the decoration of this shop, and I rarely see this type of decoration type izakaya.

氣氛好、餐點好吃，可惜服務人員有點沒耐心，因找不到酒的價格問了兩次店員，不耐煩的回說都在單子上…,"The atmosphere is good and the meals are delicious. Unfortunately, the service staff is a bit uncomfortable. I asked the clerk twice because I couldn't find the price of the wine. I was impatient on the list ..."

隱藏在內湖文德路內的精緻日式裝璜居酒屋，老板真的很有心，能夠把巷口的住宅裝璜得不僅有味道，且很有巧思。在巷路邊開窗弄成吧台形式，讓人光看一眼就很有想喝一的fu，可以說，老板的創意完全成功擄獲酒客的心。然而，料理卻是很不怎麼樣？尤其那尾午仔魚一夜干，簡直就是來自衣索匹亞的魚，又瘦又小，真是......唉！反正，就是社區型聚酒屋很一般的料理水平。所以，料理就沒什麼好評價了，至於針對他家創意裝璜給人帶來的飲酒慾望，我給它4顆星88分評價。,"The exquisite Japanese -style decoration izakaya hidden in Wende Road in Neihu. The boss is really attentive. It can decorate the residential house of the alley not only taste, but also very ingenious.Opening the window on the side of the alley into the form of a bar, it makes people want to drink a FU at a glance. It can be said that the creativity of the boss has successfully won the hearts of the liquor.However, the cooking is not very good?Especially the noon fishes all overnight, it was a fish from Ethiopya, thin and small, really ... oh!Anyway, it is a community -based polycaya.Therefore, there is no good evaluation of cuisine. As for the desire to drink for his creative decoration, I give it 4 stars 88 points."
"來到台北出差，在飯店人員的推薦下，我依然選擇了這間店，雞還在養，所以串燒要等一下，還有家樂福沒貨的台脾18天，喝的很盡興，相信我，在想喝酒的路上，來這間店，絕對不會讓你覺得服務費不值得。
致 William 的狗","When I came to Taipei for a business trip, I still chose this shop under the recommendation of the restaurant staff.

跟朋友來，坐著坐著椅背斷掉，害朋友整個跌坐在地，店家竟然完全沒道歉，好像是朋友的問題，就把椅子收走而已，這樣處理方式無法恭維,"Come with friends, sit down with the back of the chair, and hurt my friends to sit on the ground. The store did not apologize at all. It seemed to be a friend's problem."

適合畢業典禮，小酌、怡情、談天。 滴酒不沾的適合,"Suitable for graduation ceremony, drinking, happy, talk about the sky.Dripping wine is suitable"
幾天前第一次造訪，點了比目魚壽司、雞肉串、牛肉串等，以居酒屋來說價格算中等，吃起來也和價格相符，雖然沒有特別驚豔，但店內氣氛很好。不過非常可惜的是，最後結帳時不知道為什麼多收了200元左右，當下並沒有發現，後來在記帳時才發覺有誤，但沒有任何發票或收據，也沒辦法證明，雖然可能並非故意多收錢，不過感覺還是滿不好，所以之後不會再去了。,"For the first visit a few days ago, I ordered Bimu sushi, chicken skewers, beef skewers, etc. In terms of izakaya, the price is medium, and it is in line with the price. Although it is not particularly amazing, the atmosphere in the store is very good.However, it is a pity that I do n’t know why I received about 200 yuan at the end of the checkout. I did n’t find it at the moment. Later, I found that there was a mistake during the accounting, but there was no invoice or receipt. It was intentional to collect more, but it felt bad, so I won't go anymore."
店家氛圍不錯 食物美味精緻 牛肉串印象深刻 不過價格由原本90漲到120小貴 一樓旁邊開放式吸菸區座位 味道比較不好 二樓比較沒味道 偶爾放鬆的好地方！,"The store atmosphere is good. Food delicious beef skewers are deeply impressed. However, the price rose from 90 to 120 Xiaogui on the first floor of the open smoking area."

"第一次來訪，餐點美味，師傅燒烤技術一流，海鮮刺身新鮮甜美，椒鹽等佐料口味細緻，所以客單價稍高情有可原。

整間店美中不足就是一位外場綁著馬尾的女士。

一開始點餐時無主動介紹，在聽不清楚客人說話時大聲回應「蛤？」，我點完酒品以後即立刻收走菜單酒單轉身離去，沒有確認客人是否完全確認餐點了，讓人措手不及。

要特別提到的是，除了這位女士以外的店員都相當親切，上餐時也以元氣的聲音和提醒客人要上菜了，令人印象深刻。

餐間想再加點些什麼，外場女士回應「11點半廚房休息囉」低頭看錶，恰好11點半整，外場沒提醒最後加點時間，對第一次來訪的客人有些許不友善，也感到惋惜。

接著接近餐末，女士突然從我右側貼近道「可以結帳嗎？$1680」在明細和帳單都沒有主動提供下，男伴禮貌的提供她信用卡，幾分鐘後，女士拿著信用卡和收據猝不及防一句不吭的嘟到我臉前…這卡不是我提供的阿小姐？又一次的展現她對外場禮儀的缺乏。

離去前，我再次向櫃檯員工/老闆詢問了是否有明細，立刻獲得洋溢的微笑和禮貌提供，謝謝。

看著服務費和那位外場女士與熟客嘻笑，真心想建議店家提醒下這位員工的服務態度，任何工作都改由職人精神，更何況是一件如此美味的居酒屋。查看評論，這女士不是第一次引發用餐客人的關注了呢！加油喔","For the first visit, the meal is delicious, the master barbecue technology is first -class, seafood sashimi is fresh and sweet, and the flavors such as salt and salt are delicate, so the unit price is slightly affectionate.

The inadequate beauty of the whole store is a lady tied to a ponytail in the field.

At the beginning, I did not take the initiative to introduce it during the meal. I couldn't hear the guests in response to ""Clade?"" When I clicked the wine, I immediately took the menu and turned to leave. It is caught off guard.

What is mentioned in particular is that the clerks other than this lady are quite kind, and it is impressive to remind the guests with vitality and reminding guests to serve.

What do you want to add more in the meal? The ladies in the field responded to the ""half -half kitchen rest"" bowed their heads to look at the watch, which happened to be at 11:30. I did not remind the last time to add some time. I felt a little friendly and felt that the guests who visited the first visited. regret.

Then approaching the end of the meal, the lady suddenly approached the ""Can you check the checkout? $ 1680"" from the right side of me did not take the initiative to provide her credit card. After a few minutes, the lady held her credit card and receipt. I caught a word to my face without a word ... Isn't this card I provided by Miss A?Another show of her lack of etiquette on the field.

Before leaving, I asked the counter/boss again whether there was a detailed detail, and immediately got a full smile and politeness, thank you.

Watching the service fee and the lady and the cooked guests laugh, I really want to suggest that the store reminds the employee's service attitude. Any job is changed by the staff spirit, let alone such a delicious izakaya.View comments, this lady has not attracted the attention of the guests for the first time!Come on"
這裡的食材非常新鮮、我跟老公對於來這吃生魚片很安心。每一口都感受的到老闆對料理的堅持！氣氛很好的居酒屋、連不喝酒的我也很愛來這用餐！,"The ingredients here are very fresh, and my husband and I are very secure about eating sashimi here.Every bite feels the boss's insistence on cooking!Izakaya with a good atmosphere, even those who don't drink alcohol also love this meal!"
"店員親切，寵物友善餐廳。

寶寶跟小葶服務熱心 而且這邊推薦的食物都很不錯，適合下班後聚餐或是來小酌。特別推薦炸雞腿肉跟生魚片，烤物也很讚👍反正都很好吃啦！！,"The baby is enthusiastic about the service and the recommended food here. It is suitable for dinner after get off work or to drink.It is particularly recommended that fried chicken legs and sashimi, and the roasted items are also very delicious anyway!Intersection"
"外場女店員態度真的很差
上班時間頻頻和熟客聊天喝酒抽煙
反而對有需求的客人、需要點餐的客人置之不理
也不正眼看人，點個餐只會一直蛤蛤蛤
下次不會再來了 感受很差
相信不止我一個人覺得此位女店員服務態度有問題","The attitude of the female clerk in the field is really poor
Frequent work hours to chat with mature customers, drink, drink and smoke
Instead, it is ignored by the customers who need it and the guests who need to order

沒吃飽，出餐很慢，價格頗貴。第一次喝到可爾必思沙瓦像水一樣…還不如去7-11買來喝。然後吃到一半客人直接在店內抽菸🙄被迫變聞煙味邊吃還真是傻眼,"I did n’t eat, the meal was very slow, and the price was very expensive.The first time I drank Kerbishawa like water ... It is better to go to 7-11 to buy it.Then, half of the guests were so dumbfounded that they were forced to smell the smell of smoke in the store."

"以居酒屋來說，價格偏貴，食物偏難吃，分量偏少，食物送到都是冷的，不知道是不是巧合，同行的人吃完都拉肚子
論食材，論環境，論氣氛，論價位，都不會再回顧的一家店","In terms of izakaya, the price is expensive, the food is unpalatable, the weight is small, and the food is cold. I don’t know if it is a coincidence.

"請誠意做生意！媽媽去買四樣品項共600元，結帳時被收「1440元」，對店家信任沒有多想就付錢了。

回家之後才察覺不對勁，回店裡對帳，店員一副知道自己多算、不意外的樣子，一點歉意都沒有、還退得不乾不脆！！！

最後因媽媽堅持、花很多時間 一來一往，才把多付的錢都退回。（且沒有拿到發票）

看了前面的評論，看來多收錢是常態了！不過這次多840元太誇張囉。

**更：謝謝店家的回覆，但是因處理態度實在不佳，再加上我爬前面評論發現經常有小額多收費的歷史，之後並不會想再回去消費。

若已經是誠實處理，那我這邊更改為「請誠意做生意」，希望仔細算賬，不要再有這樣的問題，謝謝。","Please do business sincerely!My mother went to buy a total of 600 yuan, and was collected ""1440 yuan"" at the checkout. I paid without much trust in the store.

After returning home, he noticed that he was wrong. He returned to the store and returned. The clerk knew how much he was counting and not unexpected.IntersectionIntersection

In the end, because the mother insisted and spent a lot of time, I returned the more money.(And no invoice is obtained)

After reading the previous comments, it seems that it is normal to collect more money!But 840 yuan this time is too exaggerated.

** More: Thank you for your reply, but because of the poor handling attitude, coupled with my climbing previous comments, I found that there is often a history of small charges, and I do n’t want to go back to consumption afterwards.

If it is already honest, then I have changed to ""please do business sincerely"". I hope to settle accounts carefully. Don't have such a problem, thank you."
今天哥們聚會，真的是吃的太開心了，點的樣樣都好吃不雷👍店員，老闆也都也很熱情待人親切👍👍👍👍👍👍👍會常來的，重點是寶寶很漂亮，一定要來！ …,"Today, the buddy party is really too happy, the order is delicious, and the bosses are also very enthusiastic about others. The point is that the baby is very beautiful. , Must come!Mowing"
聖誕節第一次來消費，店員都穿著聖誕樹造型的衣服，很特別，店內氛圍很好，服務生態度很不錯，食材也很新鮮，用料實在，價位這樣算合理啦，下次還會再來消費的🥰,"For the first time on Christmas, the clerk is wearing a Christmas tree -shaped clothes. It is very special. The atmosphere in the store is very good, the service ethics is very good, the ingredients are also fresh, the ingredients are real, the price is so reasonable, and I will come again next time again. Consumer 🥰"
"第一次吃到天婦羅上菜時直接泡在醬汁裡，上菜時下半部已經軟爛了，建議店家把醬汁分開放。

二樓雖然是非吸煙區，但從一樓竄上來的煙味非常重，也沒有窗戶，空氣沒流通很悶，簡直是二手菸區。

這次點的串物除了干貝好吃外，其他的普通，CP值偏低。烏龍麵200一小盤味道普通。海鮮大阪燒油膩，沒什麼料，幾乎都麵粉，個人覺得滿不好吃的。但酒還不錯。

整體來說吃完有種不知道今天到底吃到什麼卻又花一堆錢的感覺，吃完沒有滿足的心情。本來想說居酒屋應該很少有雷，但這家對我來說算雷了😅","For the first time, I was soaked in the sauce when I was serving the food. The lower half of the food was softened. It is recommended that the store open the sauce separately.

Although the second floor is a non -smoking area, the smoke smell from the first floor is very heavy, and there are no windows. The air is not very stuffy. It is a second -hand smoke area.

In addition to the delicious scallops at the skewers this time, the other ordinary, the CP value is low.A small plate of oolong noodles is ordinary.Seafood Osaka is greasy, there is no material, almost all flour, I personally feel that it is not delicious.But wine is pretty good.

On the whole, there is a feeling that I do n’t know what to eat but spend a lot of money today.I originally wanted to say that Izakaya should have little thunder, but this one is a thunder for me."

氣氛非常好，肉串很好吃，店員老闆服務很好，上菜迅速，味道比一般串燒店好吃很多！,"The atmosphere is very good, the meat skewers are delicious, the clerk and boss service is very good, the food is fast, and the taste is much better than the general skewers!"
另一間（金湖店）半夜也常常很吵，而且有時連半夜關店了，一群人還在唱卡啦ok或放音樂到3、4點，而且每次經過騎樓一堆人抽菸超臭，所以特地來文德店看看大家的評論，看看老闆是分店沒管好還是老闆的做事風格就是這樣，看到其他住戶的留言，做生意做成這樣，我雖然沒來這間吃過，還是先給最低的一顆星，等到哪天老闆肯把兩間店都改善，我再把一星留言刪除。,"Another (Jinhu Store) is often noisy in the middle of the night, and sometimes it is closed in the middle of the night. A group of people are still singing cards OK or placing music to 3 or 4 o'clock, and each time a bunch of people go through a bunch of people to smoke, they are super smelly. , So come to Wende Store to see everyone's comments, see if the boss is not well or the boss's style of doing things. , Still give the lowest star first. When the boss is willing to improve both stores, I will delete one star with a message."
東西還不錯吃，地點也離家裡很近，喝點小酒走路回家還不錯。只是在二樓外場服務的走動頻率有點低，服務跟點餐需求都要特別走到一樓去。另外，當天晚上附近的兩桌的用餐的人，音量已經大到我跟朋友的話對話都有點聽不清楚，所以整體的體驗也有些影響。,"Things are not bad, the location is very close to home, and it is not bad to drink a little wine and walk home.It is only a bit low on the walking frequency of the outside field on the second floor. The service and ordering needs must be particularly walked to the first floor.In addition, the people at the two tables near the two tables near that night were so large that the conversation with my friends was a bit unclear, so the overall experience also had some impact."
店員人很好很可愛很熱情，餐點會不定期更新很好吃，很適合小酌，聚會聊天的好地方，大推,"The shopkeeper is very good and cute, very fond, the meal will be unregular updated very good food, very suitable for small teas, gathering chat good place, big push"
以前很愛來這裡點酒蒸蛤蜊，上一次吃覺得蛤蜊有臭味+沙沒吐乾淨，想說可能是個案，這次再給個機會去，結果還是一樣有微微腥臭+沙🥲🥲🥲 …,I used to love here to order wine and steaming clams. The last time I felt that the clams had odor+sand didn't vomit clean. I wanted to say that it might be a case. This time I gave another chance.
"炸雞軟骨必點👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
已經回訪好多次了，酒蒸蛤蜊、握壽司、生魚片、炒水蓮每樣都很讚，隨便點都不會失望的店！
店員也很親切，很適合下班來喝一杯放鬆心情 …","Fried chicken cartilage must be ordered

心情不好一個人來時，店員跟老闆都會熱情招待，完全不會冷落客人，招牌一夜干跟牛舌都讓人回味無窮，是一間會推薦給朋友們的店，一樓座位區可以抽菸，與朋友喝酒聊天相當方便。,"When a person is in a bad mood, when a person comes, the clerk and the boss will warmly entertain, and they will not leave the guests at all. The signboards overnight and the beef tongue are all memorable. It is a shop that will be recommended to friends. It is quite convenient to chat with friends."
食物普通，串燒缺乏熱度及香氣，候餐時間極長，但價格偏高加上服務費後更高，加上沒有供應茶水，要這個服務費看不出是什麼道理。,"The food is ordinary, the skewers lack the heat and aroma, and the time is very long, but the price is higher and the service fee is higher. In addition, there is no tea, and it is not the reason for this service fee to see."
台北市數一數二好吃又新鮮的生魚片私心推薦一夜乾一定要點（自家店內熟成）肉質細嫩就像剛抹完珍珠在臉上的皮膚吃進去🥰🥰 …,The best of the best and fresh raw fish slices in Taipei City is recommended to dry overnight (cooked in your own store) The flesh is tender like just wiping the skin of pearls on your face.
"來n年了
東西好吃，服務超級好
愛店之一❤️","It's come to N years
The stuff is delicious, the service is super good
One of the love shop ❤️"
"很多客人都很吵，愈晚愈吵，附近的住家苦不堪言。店家如果要做開放空間，應該管一下顧客大聲喧嘩，否則請做室內生意就好，真的建議你不要做開放空間。請將心比心，這間居酒屋的吵雜簡直是鄰近的嫌惡設施了。嚴正建請店家自省。

**補充: 以上評論是在疫情之前，貴店生意興隆的狀況，最近無法內用當然改善很多，也給附近住戶好幾個安靜的夜晚。唉，還是謝謝您的回覆。","Many guests are noisy, the more noisy, the more the houses nearby are miserable.If the store wants to make an open space, it should take care of the customer's loud noise, otherwise please do indoor business. I really recommend that you do not do open space.Please compare your heart, the noise of this izakaya is simply the suspect facilities nearby.Yan Zhengjian invited the store to refuge.

** Supplement: The above comments are the prosperous business before the epidemic. Recently, it has not been used to improve a lot, and it has given nearby residents several quiet nights.Alas, thank you for your reply."
"東西真的很好吃～
價格算評價～
服務真的很棒～
有機會～會在回吃！","Things are really delicious ~
Price calculation ~
The service is really great ~
Have a chance ~ I will eat back!"
內湖區顯少的好吃燒烤居酒屋，價格親民，環境舒適,"There are few delicious barbecue izakaya in Neihu District, the price is close to the people, and the environment is comfortable"
環境不錯，餐點味道還行，價格偏高，上菜速度慢，令人失望的是白飯沒了未事先告知或詢問是否更換其他餐點，等了近兩個小時去問才知道還沒開始做，印象不太好。,"The environment is good, the taste of the meal is okay, the price is high, the food is slow, the disappointing thing is that the rice has not been notified or asked if it changes the other meals in advance. Do not impress well."
燈光美，氣氛佳， 老闆人都很好，菜色也很讚。 內湖好去處 唯一推薦。,"The lights are beautiful, the atmosphere is good, the boss is very good, and the dishes are very good.The only recommendation of Neihu is a good place."
每來必點的一夜干、酒蒸蛤蜊、酥炸雞腿肉，真的好好吃喔👍💖❤️,"It's really delicious every night, steaming clams, steamed clams, crispy fried chicken legs,"
口味都還不錯,The taste is not bad
"如果一切都很美味，但是以經夜晚近11:30,客人喧囂的噪音，周遭住戶的安寧與休息皆受到傷害;這有些自私!
如果一切都很美好，但是你們的美好是建立在別人的容忍與痛苦!
為何不想一個兩全其美的方式，好好製造美味與美好？
好好把美味與美好帶給大家，而不是一些人快樂，另一些人就要倒楣!
如果顧客知道，來消費，是把自己的快樂建立在其他人的痛苦，事後，還有被詛咒的感覺，應該也不是很快樂!
想辦法改善，使大家衷心祝福你們生意興隆，將來必然有好發展!
創業不易，要發展更不容易!但是不製造噪音不難!
賺錢很好，賺到別人的祝福更好!","If everything is delicious, but with the noise of the hustle and bustle of the guests, the tranquility and rest of the surrounding residents are harmed; this is a bit selfish!
If everything is beautiful, but your beauty is based on the tolerance and pain of others!
Why don't you want to make deliciousness and beauty in a way in both beautiful ways?
Give everyone deliciousness and beauty, not some people, others are going to fall down!
If the customer knows, coming to spend is to build their happiness in the pain of others. Afterwards, there is a feeling of being cursed. It should not be very happy!
Find a way to improve, so that everyone will sincerely wish you a prosperous business, and there will be a good development in the future!
It is not easy to start a business, and it is not easy to develop! But it is not difficult to make noise!
It is better to make money, it is better to earn others' blessings!"

內湖最好的居酒屋酒吧之一。有很多選擇。食物確實很合胃口，但有點貴。一個不錯的地方，氣氛很好，可以與朋友或同事一起喝一杯冷飲。服務往往很慢，但食物值得等待。該地區周圍停車可能比較困難，但附近有許多公共交通工具。如果有機會的話一定要試試看。,"One of the best izakaya bars in Neihu.There are many options.Food is really appetizing, but a bit expensive.A good place, the atmosphere is very good, you can drink a glass of cold drinks with friends or colleagues.Services are often very slow, but food is worth waiting.Parking around the area may be difficult, but there are many public transportation nearby.If you have a chance, you must try it."
食物還不錯，我最喜歡的是青龍牛肉串，不辣，調味完美！  這個地方主要關心的不是食物，而是它的服務和上菜的速度。  在整整45分鐘的時間裡，只上了一道菜（3串），我和朋友在等待中已經很餓了，又擔心上菜速度太快而點不上菜。  當時餐廳並不擁擠，但看起來他們人手不足，無法正常表演。一道菜從來沒有來過。,"The food is pretty good. My favorite is the green dragon beef skewers. It is not spicy and perfect!This place is mainly concerned about food, but its service and the speed of serving.For 45 minutes, only one dish (3 skewers) were put in. My friends and I were already hungry in waiting, and I was worried that the speed of serving was too fast and could not order.At that time, the restaurant was not crowded, but it seemed that they were insufficient and could not perform normally.A dish has never been here."
不錯！不錯的小地方。,good!Good small place.
日式餐廳，菜餚美味，價格合理。不過由於他們的店是半開放的，所以去的時候太熱了，如果你夏天去的話盡量找二樓的座位。,"Japanese -style restaurants, delicious dishes and reasonable prices.However, because their shop is semi -open, it is too hot when you go. If you go in summer, try to find the seat on the second floor."
食物很棒😋,Food is great 棒
服務還可以。但食物價格過高，品質也很一般：/如果你真的必須在附近吃飯，這裡可能是個選擇。但我更願意進一步尋找內湖的其他更好的選擇。,"The service is okay.But the price of food is too high, and the quality is very average:/If you really have to eat nearby, this may be a choice.But I am more willing to find other better choices in Neihu."
這個地方已經去過兩次了。強烈推薦。我和我的朋友認為這是一個價格合理的此類食物的地方。,This place has been there twice.Strongly recommended.My friends and I think this is a place where a reasonable price is.
內湖的這個可愛的地方很有趣，很有創意，是一邊喝啤酒和一些飲料一邊吃美味的日式啤酒食物的好地方。,This cute place in Neihu is very interesting and creative. It is a good place to eat beer and some drinks while eating delicious Japanese beer food.
良好的服務,Good service
牛肉串好好吃，一夜乾也好吃。,"The beef skewers are delicious, and it is delicious overnight."
