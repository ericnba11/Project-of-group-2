"你有吃過以清酒為主題的超酷餐酒館嗎⁉️
微醺·中山就位在行天宮捷運站附近步行5分鐘左右的距離，交通超級方便！
真的很適合下班後和三五好友小酌，當天也有遇到一位用餐、獨自享受個人時光的鄰桌客人～
餐點部分我覺得口味都在水準之上，店員一人hold住全場料理和酒水真的很厲害🤣

其中讓我覺得最驚豔也覺得必點的應該是煙燻蘿蔔，蘿蔔乾的煙燻香氣是我從未品嚐過的，每一次咀嚼都會跟著脆口的感受一起迸發在口中～
比目魚西京燒烤的很香，滿滿鮮甜的汁水裹在錫箔紙內，邊邊烤到微焦、配上軟嫩油脂豐富的魚肉真的絕了！
牛肋串一份有兩串，軟嫩度恰到好處，鹹香鹹香非常下酒🥩
炙燒干貝超級大顆～而且相當新鮮！
熟度也是我最喜歡的那種，搭配上方的魚子醬鮮度更提升了一個檔次
起司骰子牛裡面有著滿滿蒜香，融化的起司尬上蒜酥的調味怎麼能不好吃！
搭配上清酒真的是無敵下酒菜🥹

以下附上當天點的品項名稱👇🏻
🔸炙燒干貝
🔹牛肋串
🔸比目魚西京燒
🔹煙燻蘿蔔

Weiyi Zhongshan is in the distance of about 5 minutes near Xingtian Palace MRT Station, which is super convenient for transportation!
It is really suitable for drinking after get off work and three or five friends. On the same day, I also met a next -table guest who dine and enjoyed personal time.
I think the taste is above the standard. The clerk holds the whole dishes and drinks.

Among them, I feel the most amazing and I think it should be smoky radish. The smoky aroma of dried radish is what I have never tasted. Every time I chew, I will burst out in my mouth with the crispy feeling ~
It is very fragrant than the west of the west of the west. The sweet juice is wrapped in tin foil paper. It is really absolutely baked to grill to slightly coke and be equipped with soft and tender oil!
There are two strings of beef ribs, the softness is just right, the salty and salty fragrance is very wine 🥩
Boiled scallion is super big ~ and quite fresh!
The degree of maturity is also my favorite. With the lugga sauce above the above, it has increased a grade
The cheese dice is full of garlic. How can the melted cheese embarrassing flavor of garlic crispy be delicious!
It is really invincible wine and vegetables with sake

微醺中山相較於一般只注重酒精飲品的酒吧，微醺中山清酒餐酒館更適合喜歡在享受美食的同時，輕鬆小酌的人，從小吃、主菜到當日限定的特色料理，店內的牆上菜單會不定期調整，每次來都有機會發現新的驚喜！這樣的變化讓人每次造訪都充滿期待和新鮮感。,"Compared with the bars that only pay attention to wine and fine beverages, Weilian Zhongshan is more suitable for those who like to enjoy food while enjoying food, from snacks and main dishes that are limited to the same day. The menu will be adjusted from time to time, and every time I come, I have the opportunity to discover a new surprise!Such changes make people look forward to and fresh every visit."
"清酒🍶香甜美味～適合晚上來放鬆，環境隱密，遠離塵囂！
餐點很美味🤤超級推！起司牛肉、鮮蚵、天婦羅私心特別愛～ 但每道料理都很高分😻","Sake 味 sweet and delicious ~ suitable for relaxation at night, the environment is secret, stay away from the hustle and bustle!

"清酒為主題的餐酒館
店內空間不大，但是餐點真的超推
多種的清酒可以選、真的可以來喝看看
每種餐點都很好吃
來這裡與朋友小酌很優質","Bart -ups -themed dining tavern
The space in the store is not large, but the meal is really overshoot
A variety of sake can be selected, you can really drink it to see
Each meal is delicious
It's high -quality to have a drink with friends here"
"清酒好喝順口🍶每道菜都好吃😋
地理位置也很方便，靠近行天宮站1號出口🙌🏻","Sake is delicious and smooth 菜 Each dish is delicious 😋
The geographical location is also very convenient."
日本居酒屋風格（不是台灣日式居酒屋）的餐酒館，適合正餐吃到七八分飽後，和朋友小酌吃點下酒菜的地方。餐點的份量不大，大概喝個兩杯剛好吃完的程度。如果是抱著想吃到的心態來，可能會花了一大堆錢還很餓。有低消$600的限制，兩杯酒就差不多了。店裡有不少不好買到的酒款，像是這次喝台雲酒造的龜治和神力就是，喜歡喝日本清酒的朋友可以來試試看,"The dining tavern of Japanese izakaya (not Taiwan's Japanese -style izakaya) is suitable for the place where the dining is full after eating seven or eight, and a drink with friends to eat some wine and vegetables.The weight of the meal is not large, and it is about two cups just to eat.If you want to eat the mentality you want to eat, it may take a lot of money to be hungry.There is a limit of $ 600, and two glasses of wine are almost the same.There are a lot of wines that are not easy to buy in the store, such as the turtle and divine power made by drinking Taishun wine this time. Friends who like to drink Japanese sake can try it to try to see"
"店內空間雖然不大，但是佈置溫馨各種療癒小物穿插其中。
食物和酒水都很讚，其中我最愛「北海道鮭魚石狩鍋」一塊塊鮮美鮭魚隨著熱湯入口，真是超幸福的啦！","Although the space in the store is not large, it is interspersed with warm various healing things.
Food and drinks are very good. Among them, my favorite ""Hokkaido salmon stone hunting pot"" is a piece of delicious salmon with the entrance of the hot soup. It is really happy!"
"很像酒吧版的深夜食堂，很多可愛貓咪擺設
台雲 純米吟釀，酒感滑順清甜，而不會嗆或辛辣
廣島炸牡蠣有夠好吃,還很大顆
門司港燒咖哩，牽絲起司消夜吃好罪惡~","Very similar to the bar version of the bar version of the night cafeteria, many cute cat furnishings
Taiyun pure rice yin brewed, the wine feels smooth and sweet, but it will not be spicy or spicy
Hiroshima fried oysters are delicious enough, and they are still very large
Mansi Port Burning Curry, the cheese cheese eliminates the night to eat a good sin ~"
餐酒館裡的擺設與餐具，大部分都是以可愛貓咪為主題，讓人覺得溫馨與舒適。,"Most of the furnishings and tableware in the dining tavern are based on cute cats, making people feel warm and comfortable."
"今天喝了兩種清酒，一種是帶有果香，另一個則是較有穀物的香氣，我很享受清酒慢慢入口到吞嚥後在口中留下的迷人氣息。除了清酒我們也點了甜甜的果實酒，很適合不想喝多的朋友。我個人比較推薦清酒配餐食，可以感受到兩者互相交織的變化。

「西班牙蒜蝦」脆而保有嚼勁的麵包，沾著橄欖油與蒜片，承載蝦肉與杏鮑菇，蒜香四溢，讓人愛不釋手。蝦子是使用晶瑩剔透的蝦仁，吃起來QQ的，我覺得如果用紮實彈牙的鮮蝦可能會更好吃。

網路上看到很多人推薦雞翅，我們點了「明太子雞翅」，雞翅的外皮吃起來Q軟，富有膠質感，裡面塞了滿滿明太子，吃起來鮮而不腥。

下酒總會想來些串燒，「牛肋條串」評價很好，貪心的我直接點了「串燒組合」，組合中有牛肉、雞肉、七里香、大腸跟茭白筍肉串。我特別喜歡皮脆肉彈的烤雞肉串，讓水嫩多汁的茭白筍加入串燒也讓我眼睛一亮。","Today, I drank two kinds of sake, one with fruity aroma, and the other was the more aroma of grain. I enjoyed the charming atmosphere left in my mouth after swallowing.In addition to sake, we also ordered sweet fruit wine, which is very suitable for friends who don't want to drink too much.I personally recommend sake meals, and I can feel the changes of the two.

""Spanish garlic shrimp"" is crispy and chewy bread, stained with olive oil and garlic slices, carried shrimp and Pleurotus eryngii, and the garlic is overflowing, which makes people love it.The shrimp uses crystal clear shrimp, which tastes QQ. I think it may be better if you use solid fresh shrimp.

I saw a lot of people recommend chicken wings on the Internet. We ordered ""Prince Chicken Chicken Wings"". The skin of the chicken wings was soft and full of gel.

I always want to come to some skewers. The ""beef ribs"" evaluation is very good. I ordered the ""skewers combination"" directly. In the combination, there are beef, chicken, Qili fragrant, large intestine and white bamboo shoot skewers.I especially like the grilled chicken skewers with crispy meat bomb, so that the tender and juicy white bamboo shoots are added with a skewers to make my eyes brighter."

剛好是我喜歡的馬鈴薯燉肉，
可用平實的價格享受慵懶的酒吧空間。","There are also dining taverns that provide fixed food and drinks during the day,
It happened to be my favorite potato stew,
You can enjoy the lazy bar space at a flat price."
"10/14晚上與友人來到這間餐酒館吃晚餐，店很小，有室內室外的座位。當天點了松露薯條、雞軟骨、明太子鮭魚茶泡飯、剁椒拌飯、牛勒串、馬鈴薯燉肉、玉米筍、鹽烤鯖魚、生啤、水蜜桃沙瓦。
松露薯條
它的松露不是沾醬，是薯條上面有松露，還有撒起司粉(應該是不太確定)，個人覺得蠻好吃的，但友人不太喜歡，她以為會是薯條沾松露醬。
雞軟骨 玉米筍
雞軟骨我們兩人覺得不錯吃，玉米筍就是很一般的玉米筍。
明太子鮭魚茶泡飯
是友人點的，她覺得有點鹹，不過算是好吃的。
剁椒拌飯
本人點的，我覺得很鹹...，上面的蛋不是半熟蛋，但也不是全熟蛋(我以為會是半熟蛋，會流出蛋黃的那種)，然後也是真的辣!但是因為真的太鹹了我最後沒有吃完，盡力吃到剩下三分之一。
牛勒串
這超好吃，調味調的超棒的，只能說如果要來這家一定要點!!!
馬鈴薯燉肉
我跟友人都覺得裡面的肉很好吃!!馬鈴薯跟蘿蔔也不錯。
鹽烤鯖魚
我不太喜歡吃魚，但至少他們的魚沒有腥味我就給滿分。
生啤、水蜜桃沙
就是很正常的啤酒跟沙瓦。

最後我們總消費了1870
就是很台北市的價格XD
現在可以刷卡了!
看到有評論說只能付現，幫店家更新一下:)","On the evening of 10/14, I came to this restaurant for dinner with my friends. The shop was very small and there were seats in indoor and outdoor.On the day, it ordered truffle potatoes, chicken cartilage, prince salmon tea, rice, chopped pepper bibimbap, beef skewers, potato stewed meat, corn bamboo shoots, salt grilled catfish, raw beer, peach sandwater.
Truffle fries
Its truffles are not dipped in sauce, there are truffles on the fries, and the sprinkled fans (it should be not sure). I personally think it is delicious, but her friend does not like it. She thinks it will be the fries. Essence
Chicken cartilage corn bamboo shoots
Chicken cartilage feels good to eat, corn bamboo shoots are very ordinary corn bamboo shoots.
Ming Prince Salmon Tea Bubble Rice
It's a friend, she feels a bit salty, but it is delicious.
Chopped bibimbap
I ordered it, I think it is very salty ..., the egg on it is not a semi -cooked egg, but it is not all cooked eggs (I think it will be a semi -cooked egg, which will flow out of the egg yolk), and then it is really spicy! But because it is true, because it is true I'm too salty, I didn't finish it in the end, I tried my best to eat one -third of the remaining.
Cowboy
This is super delicious, the seasoning is great, it can only be said that if you want to come to this one, you must order it !!!
Potato stew
Both of my friends and I think the meat inside is delicious !! potato and radish are also good.
Salt grilled catfish
I do n’t like eating fish, but at least their fish do n’t have a full score.
Raw Beer, Moan Sand
It is normal beer and savana.

In the end we spent 1870

很適合自己下班來或是跟1.2個朋友來

清酒味道都很不錯，high ball、調酒味道也很好
不愧是主打喝酒配餐的店家
酒類怎麼點都不會踩雷
推推西班牙海鮮蒜蝦、章魚、皮蛋
老闆一人作業（後來有看到另外一位客座廚師來
所以有時候餐點等待時間會長一些","Many cat furnishings in the store, super cute 😍
It's very suitable for yourself to come off work or come with 1.2 friends

It is worthy of the main shop that focuses on drinking and meal
How can you step on the mine?
Push Spain seafood garlic shrimp, octopus, preserved eggs
The boss works (later I saw another guest chef
So sometimes the meal waiting time will grow some"
"店內空間不大，主要是以吧台位子為主，裝潢則以暗色系為主，但因為老闆很喜歡貓咪，店內到處都是貓咪相關的物品，讓整間店看起來很有特色🐈

廣島炸牡蠣(3枚) $150

炸得黃金酥脆的牡蠣裡面要起來多汁軟嫩而且很鮮甜，再搭配旁邊的沾醬整個超涮嘴🤤

椒麻皮蛋 $120

Q彈中又帶有綿密口感的皮蛋搭配微微辛辣的辣油，整體香氣濃郁超開胃🤩

馬鈴薯燉肉 $260

綿密道入口即化的馬鈴薯Q彈有嚼勁的豬肉塊很入味，一口咬下，鹹香中帶有淡淡香甜的調味讓人欲罷不能，吃起來好吃又暖胃😍

西班牙蒜蝦 $320

彈牙的蝦子鮮味十足中帶有香氣十足的蒜味，搭配旁邊酥脆的麵包口感很豐富，不過整體吃起來有一丟丟偏油😅

串燒組合(5串) $260

什麼都想吃又怕太多的時候，串燒組合真的是很好的選擇😉

有帶有嚼勁的大腸、軟嫩的牛肉、Juicy的雞肉、軟Q的大腸和脆口的茭白筍肉串，每一樣都鹹香帶有肉質的鮮甜，再搭配一口清酒超爽快的🥰

地獄辣雞翅(5枚) $250

還特別問了店員說是否會很辣，店員都說沒吃到大辣的人千萬不要輕易嘗試，叛逆的我直接點了一份😂

一口咬下，辛辣的香料味很香，肉質也很軟嫩多汁👍🏻

一開始吃的時候還覺得沒什麼，原來大辣也不過如此，結果過不到30秒，直接開始灌啤酒跟清酒（因為店家沒有水），又因為害怕喝太快酒，所以點了一杯可樂，沒想到不但不解辣，還更刺激辣的感覺，差點原地爆炸💥

最後才用了店家給的冰塊+自己帶的水才好好的把辣消掉，真的有夠辣，沒辦法吃到大辣的人真的不要輕易嘗試🥵

彗星 蘋果酸 $260

很好喝的一杯清酒，酸甜的蘋果香氣搭配清酒本身的清香，整體口感清爽卻層次豐富，一下子就喝完了😍

小鼓梅酒 $280

聽店家說這杯梅酒因為用了白蘭地釀造所以酒精濃度足足有16%，但喝下去完全沒有明顯的酒精味，完全只喝到香甜的口感，真的忍不住會一口接一口的喝，大家真的要小心點喝唷😉

⚠️ 每人的低消600（需含一杯酒水）
⚠️3人以上訂位需預付訂金（人數*低消）","The space in the store is not large, mainly based on the bar table, and the decoration is mainly dark colors, but because the boss likes cats very much, cat -related items are everywhere in the store, so that the entire store looks very distinctive.

Hiroshima Fried Oyster (3) $ 150

The fried golden and crispy oysters should be juicy and tender and very sweet, and then match the entire super pouting mouth with the dipping sauce next to it.

Pepperca egg $ 120

Q bombs with dense eggs with slightly spicy spicy oil, the overall aroma is strong and super appetizer 🤩

Potato stew $ 260

The potato Q bomb -chewy pork pieces that are melted at the entrance of the dense road are very flavorful. Bite the sip, the salty flavor with a touch of sweet seasoning makes people want to stop, it tastes delicious and warm stomach 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍

Spanish garlic shrimp $ 320

Pochonal shrimp is full of aroma with aroma, and the crispy bread is rich in mouth, but the overall tastes it.

Stringing combination (5 skewers) $ 260

When you want to eat everything and you are afraid of too much, the skewers combination is really a good choice 😉

There are chewy large intestines, soft beef, JUICY chicken, soft Q large intestine and crispy white bamboo shoot skewers.

Hell spicy chicken wings (5) $ 250

I also asked the clerk whether it would be spicy. The clerk said that people who did n’t eat big spicy should not try it easily.

After bite, the spicy spice taste is very fragrant, and the meat is very soft and juicy.

When I was eating at first, I still felt nothing. It turned out to be so spicy. As a result, less than 30 seconds passed, and began to irrigate beer and sake (because the shop did not have water), and because I was afraid of drinking too fast wine, I ordered a cup of cola. I did not expect that not only did not understand spicy, but also more exciting spicy feelings, almost exploded in place 💥

Finally, I used the ice cubes given by the store+the water brought by myself.

Comet apple acid $ 260

A very delicious glass of sake, the sweet and sour apple aroma with the fragrance of the sake itself, the overall taste is refreshing but rich in layers, and it is finished.

Drummeli wine $ 280

Listening to the store said that this glass of plum wine is 16%of the concentration of alcohol because of Bailan's brewed, but there is no obvious alcohol taste at all. It only drinks the sweet taste at all. Everyone really wants to drink carefully 心 心 心 心 心

6️ The low consumption of each person is 600 (need to contain a glass of drinks)
订️3 or more reservations require prepaid deposit (number of people*low)"

"隱藏在巷弄內的餐酒館！
點了生啤和柚子酒表現都超讚，生啤的杯子有先冰過，喝到最後都還是很冰，直接續了3杯～
點了幾樣小食表現都不錯，尤其是那條又大又Q的喜知次，雖然等了一陣子但絕對會回購。
松露薯條的松露味滿香的，美中不足的是上來的時候，薯條已經冷掉了，可能是店內客人太多有些忙～
店內空間不大，有一個獨立沙發座和三個小圓桌，老闆娘會和熟客一起聊天～","The restaurant hidden in the alley!
The performance of raw beer and grapefruit wines are very happy. The cups of raw beer have been ice first, and they are still very ice when they drink until the end.
I ordered a few snacks to perform well, especially the big and Q's joy.
The truffles of truffle cannon stripes are full of fragrant flavor. When the beauty is not enough, when it comes up, the fries have been cold. There may be too many guests in the store ~
The space in the store is not large. There is a separate sofa seat and three small round tables. The boss will chat with mature customers ~"

但沒有開單杯服務
應該先告知
結帳價格超哇噻","Chicken wings are delicious, other meals ...

If it is sake dining tavern
But no single cup service
Should be informed first
The checkout price is super wow"
牆上掛著老闆的國際清酒執照，就算不能出國去日本，在這裡還是可以享受到多款清酒，就知道來這可以尋找到適合自己的味道,"There is a boss's international sake license on the wall. Even if you can't go abroad to Japan, you can still enjoy a variety of sake here. You know that you can find the taste that suits you"
想要自己放鬆，蠻不錯的居酒屋。,"I want to relax by myself, pretty good izakaya."
"「微醺便好，遠離塵囂，享受當下」
這是微醺•中山的標語更是本店最好的註解，一進門便有如此之感受。

"坐吧檯，座位很擁擠不舒服，和朋友聊天店員都聽得清清楚楚，很尷尬。
開放式廚房，吃完身上會有油煙味；料理吃完想不到一道有印象的，沒有推薦任何一道，酒尚可。
店裡沒有音樂。
低消要600塊，但環境、食物、服務的體驗都不優，之後不會再去了。","Sitting on the bar, the seat was crowded and uncomfortable, and the clerk chatted with friends clearly, very embarrassing.
The open kitchen will have a smell of oil fume after eating; I ca n’t think of the impression after eating. There is no recommendation of any one.
There are no music in the store.
It costs 600 yuan low, but the environment, food, and service experience are not good, and will not go again."
"超有特色的日式小酒館
廁所的設計真的很酷😂😂","Ultra -distinctive Japanese -style tavern
The design of the toilet is really cool"
"座位區偏小，並有油煙味。

服務：
儘管桌子下有置物勾，置物空間仍不足，但不會主動提供置物籃，需要詢問才有。
持續收盤子，但店裡其實沒什麼人，顯得對客人對話有打斷感。
店內不提供水，但有提供購買，一瓶礦泉水80元，一個滿驚訝的價格。
收取服務費，但整體服務有待改善。

食物：
多數是冷凍食品，或氣炸鍋的產物。
食物份量小，以價格來說，cp值低，會有吃不飽的感覺，並且美味程度需要更努力。

酒水：
一般，沒有特別感受。","The seat area is small and has the smell of oil fume.

Serve:
Although there is a hook under the table, the space of the placement is still insufficient, but it will not actively provide a basket, and you need to ask.
Continue to close the market, but there is no one in the store, and it seems to have a sense of interruption of the guest conversation.
It does not provide water in the store, but it provides purchases. A bottle of mineral water is 80 yuan, a surprising price.
The service fee is charged, but the overall service needs to be improved.

food:
Most of them are frozen foods, or air -frying pots.
The food portion is small. In terms of price, the CP value is low, and it will feel like eating, and the degree of deliciousness needs to work harder.

Wine:
Generally, there is no particular feeling."
女店長人超好，因為不知道店裡只收現金，身上帶的錢不夠，還請了我一杯生啤酒，太感謝了！環境很棒，而且酒也好喝，推推～,"The female shop chief is super good, because I do n’t know that the store only collects cash, and the money is not enough. I also invited me a cup of beer. Thank you so much!The environment is great, and the wine is delicious, push push ~"
很有日本居酒屋既視感～,很有日本居酒屋既視感～

作為日式酒館不錯，但餐實在等太久了，還聽錯數量及品項，我們剛開始點了2碗泡飯及2碗烏龍麵，還有一些酒品，結果其他人的餐都上完了，才發現還少一碗泡飯，另外，原本要點李子酒，結果上來荔枝奶酒，想說這個就算惹，沒想到等餐等了1個小時左右吧...外場店員只有一個真是辛苦了,"It is good to be Japanese tavern, but the meal has been waiting for too long, and the quantity and items have been heard.
