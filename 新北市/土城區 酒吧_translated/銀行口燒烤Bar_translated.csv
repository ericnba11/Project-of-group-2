買二串甜不辣都沒烤透，濕濕黏黏的，醬料還在上面，就是烤熱後刷上一層醬料，香腸口味偏鹹，不知道哪裡批來的貨，這種炭烤技術水平，不如我在家中秋自己烤，極不推薦，看來3.6分的評價非常準,"Buy two strings of sweet and not spicy, not baked, wet and sticky, and the sauce is still on it, that is, brush a layer of sauce after roasting heat.

尚可，看到烤香菇時覺得略少，份量為1.5朵香菇，建議可以貴個5-10元，給完整香菇，感覺賣相較好。烤豬大腸口感有嚼勁帶點脆，不過上面的醬感覺是上桌前塗的，口感個人覺得醬味太重。這次還有點烤雞排、臭豆腐、牛小排（忘了拍照）也還行；臭豆腐建議可以不用點，很像一般外面吃得到的臭豆腐，沒有炭烤的味道，泡菜不錯吃但份量不多。,"I still feel slightly less when I see the grilled shiitake mushrooms.

覺得有點誇張，之前就感覺店家態度不是很好，但也是買了幾次，直到最後一次買了烤雞腿外帶，回來之後發現整塊雞皮都沒了，這次真的忍不住了，打電話反應，闆娘回答雞皮烤焦了所以拿掉了，我說那是最好吃的呀！雖然是有說叫我拿回去補我一支，但是不用了！這家店對自己的品質太不負責了,"I feel a bit exaggerated. I felt that the store's attitude was not very good before, but I bought it a few times until I bought the grilled chicken leg with the last time.

服務費我傻了，因為沒服務到啊，收？！誇張，重點態度是這麼不甘願，請店休一天或是一個月，心情整頓好再開業，東西尚可，貴沒關係，態度愛理不理，點餐口頭點餐寫紙本不行嗎，搞得跟居酒屋一樣，什麼階級就做什麼，以前在銀行面前比較好吃，換了位置換了腦殼，㊗️，拜拜👋,"I am stupid, because I did n’t serve it, collect it?IntersectionExaggerated, the focus of the attitude is so unwilling.

20多年前還在當時的農民銀行門口擺攤時，每週都會去買，當時的烤物真的是一串一串慢慢烤，就算要等上超過半小時都甘願，因為用心烤的真的很美味。後來改成先炸再烤，口感上就有些許落差，再加上後來搬走，直到今日找到店鋪也過了20多年沒吃過。這次抱著懷念的心情點餐，烤物一樣是先炸再烤，但烤物根本不能算是烤，只是簡單抹醬過火爐的感覺就起鍋，烤物沒有酥香味、口感濕軟，老實說吃起來的口感是不好的，且價格過高，可算是台北市稍有質感的居酒屋售價了，但卻沒有相對的料理品質，再購機率很低。,"When more than 20 years ago, at the door of the peasant bank at the time, I bought it every week. At that time, the baked items were really baked one by one. It's delicious.Later, it was changed to fry and then baked, and the taste was a little bit worse. In addition, I moved away later. I haven't eaten it for more than 20 years to find the shop today.This time I was holding the nostalgic mood to order, and the baked items were fried first and then grilled, but the grilled items could not be considered baked at all, but the feeling of simply wiping the sauce over the stove will be boiled.

服務一般般（就是沒有不好也沒有到很好），價位有一點高（物價關係是可以理解的），但因為燒烤本身就是吃奇摩子的，不是吃飽的，所以還是會消費，因為是好吃的,"The service is general (that is, it is not bad or not very good), the price is a little high (the price relationship is understandable), but because the barbecue itself is eating Qimo, it is not full Delicious",False
