台電大樓站旁有一家風格獨特的酒吧，彷彿城市中的一處綠洲。充滿中國風格的裝潢，卻不失神秘與俏皮的氛圍。這裡提供多樣的啤酒選擇，包括生啤與精釀，但讓人意外地也能品嚐到精緻的白紅酒，且價格實惠貼心。店內供應的食物偏向蔬食，為健康養生的顧客提供了更多選擇。總的來說，這是一家令人讚嘆的好地方，值得多次光臨,"There is a unique bar next to Taipower Building, like an oasis in the city.The decoration full of Chinese style is not lost without mystery and playful atmosphere.There are a variety of beer choices, including raw beer and crafts, but it can also taste exquisite white wine, and the price is affordable and intimate.The food supplied in the store is biased towards vegetables and food, providing more choices for health care customers.In general, this is a good place to be amazing, and it is worth visiting many times.",False

"整體來說是滿推薦的一間店。
服務很好，調酒算是有CP值但較為平庸。
Happy Hour的基本酒款真的是很划算，比較推薦這些！

調酒晚上才供應，下午3點以後有供應Happy Hour的酒。
3pm-9pm是Happy Hour，
Gin Tonic, Whiskey Coke, Vodka Lime, 紅白酒跟台虎925生啤都是110元。
/
The Shrine算是滿特別的，白天是咖啡店，晚上則轉換成酒吧。
個人比較喜歡晚上的調調，有燈籠真的大加分。
白天則因為店面較小，又有很多靠窗座位會直接靠騎樓外側，
所以感覺比較尷尬一點xD
/
餐點部分有試過幾項：

蒜蒜與莎莎簡單來說就是焗烤大蒜麵包附上莎莎醬。
滿用心也很好吃，但個人覺得莎莎醬沒有到相輔相成，會淡化大蒜跟起司的味道，也會影響麵包的酥脆度。
但無論如何，他還是一份有CP值且好吃的料理。

爆米花就是...爆米花。
本次店員有招待一小碗爆米花，謝謝店員 :)
鹹鹹的挺配酒。

披薩是一片大大的披薩，還算有厚度料也滿多，比很多連鎖披薩好了。
一片賣90元還算可以接受，但就沒有特別之處囉。

千層麵味道還不錯，價格也算是合理。
會附上兩塊小佛卡夏讓你配著吃，喜歡千層的可以試試看。
/
酒類有試過Happy Hour的台虎925生啤、琴通寧、Vodka Lime
另外也嘗試過晚上的長島冰茶。

前三樣都是110元，喜愛程度大概是琴通寧>台虎925>Vodka Lime。
但這些都就是基本款（生啤就只是弄到杯子而已XDD)
琴通寧跟Vodka Lime的酒味也有到位，很OK。
又比其他店家便宜，雖然小了一些但我覺得還是很有CP值。

長島冰茶個人覺得比較普通，喝起來並沒有那麼順口。
酸甜味較濃，又有點水了一些，但可能是個人喜好問題，可以試試看。
但整體來說還是OK，但CP值相較Happy Hour的酒們就是比較平庸一點。
（被Happy Hour養壞了）

整體來說我應該會給4~4.5星吧xD
但店員態度都滿好的，第一次有協助換位+請爆米花，
第二次有大位子也主動詢問是否要換位，相當貼心。
服務生態度直接幫忙補到5分xDD
很推薦白天想喝酒或有不喝酒的朋友可以拖來這裡拜訪~","Overall is a recommended shop.
The service is very good, and the bartending is a CP value but more mediocre.
Happy Hour's basic wine is really cost -effective, and it is recommended!
/ /
Skymoring is only available at night, and wine supplied to Happy Hour after 3 pm.
3 PM-9PM is Happy Hour,
Gin Tonic, Whiskey Coke, Vodka Lime, red and white wine and Taiwanese tiger 925 raw beer are 110 yuan.
/ /
The shrine is full of special, it is a coffee shop during the day, and it is converted into a bar at night.
Personally, I like the tone at night. There are really big points for lanterns.
During the day, because the storefront is small, there are many windows relying on the windows of the windows directly on the outside of the building.
So it feels embarrassing a bit XD
/ /
There are a few trials in the meal part:

In short, garlic and Sasa are baked and grilled garlic noodles with Sasa sauce.
It is also delicious, but I personally think that Sasha sauce is not complementary, it will fade the taste of garlic and cheese, and it will also affect the crispyness of the bread.
But in any case, he is still a CP value and delicious dish.

Jump rice flowers are ... popcorn.
This clerk has entertaining a small bowl of popcorn, thank you the clerk :)
Silently matched with wine.

Pizza is a large pizza, and there are still a lot of thickness, which is better than many chain pizza.
It is acceptable to sell 90 yuan, but there is nothing special.

The taste of the thousand levels is not bad, and the price is reasonable.
There will be two pieces of small Buddha Kaxia for you to eat. Those who like a thousand layers can try it.
/ /
There are Taiwanese tiger 925 raw beer, Qin Ning, Vodka Lime, who have tried Happy Hour
In addition, I also tried long island ice tea at night.

The first three are 110 yuan.
But these are the basic models (just getting the cup for raw beer XDD)
Qin Tongning and Vodka Lime have also been in place, which is OK.
It is cheaper than other stores. Although it is smaller, I still think it has a CP value.

Long Island Ice Tea personally feels more ordinary, and it is not so smooth.
The sweet and sour taste is strong and a little water, but it may be a problem with personal preferences. You can try it.
But it is OK as a whole, but the CP value is more mediocre compared to the Happy Hour.
(Raised by Happy Hour)

On the whole, I should give 4 ~ 4.5 stars xd
However, the staff attitude is good. For the first time, I will assist in the replacement+please popcorn,
For the second time, there was a big place and also asked if it was necessary to change the place, which was quite intimate.
The service ecosystem directly helps to make up for 5 points XDD

我喜歡的是它的地理位置和店內風格
每天都有Happy Hour 主題不同
不過有時候是Happy Night
例如禮拜四 整晚Asahi生啤都是$140

📍台電大樓站#4出口
或者5也可以啦只是要過個馬路

店裡有洗手間 維護得很不錯 至少通常都不會聞到什麼異味

大概是這樣

想喝好喝調酒的 真的不要去 你有更好的選擇","A few times
But in the last time I really feel that bartender is so difficult to drink ... I have to comment

There is no business in the afternoon in the afternoon
There is only one curry rice and some small snacks such as dumplings popcorn at night

The music in the store can be regarded as a loud at night, the shop clerk will turn the lights darker

What I like is its geographical location and in -store style
Every day, there are happy hour themes
But sometimes it is happy night
For example, all night in the night of ASAHI raw beer is $ 140

Takashima Building#4 Exit
Or 5 can just have a road

There is a good maintenance in the store in the store. At least usually I don’t smell any odor

"充滿異國風情的酒吧。這是住宅區的一個安靜的地方，但一旦你走進去，你會感覺自己身處曼谷唐人街或考山路的亞洲雜貨店。音樂的選擇也不錯，背景音樂的音量很大，可以聽到同伴的竊竊私語，但音量完美到幾乎聽不到鄰桌的人的聲音。不管怎樣，還是很舒服的。
雞尾酒有多種顏色，其中一些含有大量水果和香草，有些則採用創新的茶佈置。它很甜，很清爽，而且都很美味。由於是無菸房，所以沒有異味，空調運作正常。食物也很推薦。尤其是馬薩曼咖哩，和專賣店一樣美味。裡面充滿了大塊的雞肉，魚露和香料完美地融合在一起。一個神秘的空間，非常適合那些想要體驗異國情調或想要暫時逃離現實的人（笑）。","Bar full of exotic style.This is a quiet place in the residential area, but once you walk in, you will feel that you are in the Asian grocery store in Bangkok Chinatown or Kokushan Road.The choice of music is also good.
