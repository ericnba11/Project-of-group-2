貓下去招牌涼麵（$320）單價偏高，但麵的嚼勁不錯！值得來吃～我們四個人分著吃，淋上醋拌在一起也有另外一種風味！
烤中卷（$520）算是中規中矩，食材吃起來還算新鮮。
最推薦的是魚子醬與蜂蜜吐司🍞！（$240），魚子醬、松露、蜂蜜混搭真的好好吃！口味上是鹹鹹甜甜ㄉ！醬很濃郁，吐司烤得脆脆的！
貓下去麻辣薯條（$240），是切細的脆薯！麻辣粉ㄉ香氣不錯，搭配的煉乳辣醬也很適合！

魚子醬與蜂蜜吐司-四道菜算最好的一道，但對上價位差強人意，只吃到醬的味道吐司沒有麵包香，魚子醬淡淡的鹹味算有加一點分。

"氣氛非常不錯的餐廳，菜色以台式經典為主，酒類包含調酒啤酒紅白酒。薯條酥脆好吃香氣十足完全不油膩。涼麵的部分也不愧是台北最強，涼麵細又彈牙，醬汁也是讓人一口接一口，是會讓人回味的香氣。六塊肌餐包搭配獨特抹醬，麵包鬆軟香氣十足令人驚豔。其餘的菜色普普，沒有台菜應該有的水準。有素食料理很普，但當月壽星酒類全部半價的優惠覺得非常棒。

Taipei's most well -known Taiwan cuisine restaurant often sees the crowds outside, the atmosphere inside is noisy, and the best noodles in Taipei said by Ji Ji (but in fact, my impression of cold noodles is okay) For the first time It was 2018. At that time, there were many colorful beer to pick. Later, they did not sell so much beer. Division, the honey toast is self -made of cats, the taste is very fragrant. The cat's dishes can not be eaten outside. The seemingly familiar dishes, I also want to know what the cat will change.When I went to the second time I went, I felt that the grilled beef steak was great, the portion was enough, and the sweet potato side dishes were delicious. The salted chicken salad was very refreshing ~ The third time I especially like the pepper pork fart eggs, all of which are lean meat, and there are me. Favorite peppercorns ~ green sauce seafood rice is the expected taste, which is more like risotto.The Summer Sandwright is surging and delicious. French fries are the fries of general fast food shops. They are not championship fries. The third time is actually 2022. March, and I saw a vacant on Saturday afternoon. Half of seats, I didn't expect to be full of people!The other is that they found that they were very good to shoot in the toilet this time, so I thought of going to open the toilet account @toiletstovisit 😂 and then I found that they should still like the Beatles.

"就是妙妙妙／貓下去敦北俱樂部

託友人之福，約了貓下去敦北俱樂部（簡稱「貓下去」）相聚；因為是午餐時間，相對來說人比較少，大家相談甚歡伴隨可口吃食，相當愉快。

當天一行四人，點了鹹水雞沙拉（340元）、貓下去蜂蜜吐司總匯三明治（360元）、冠軍薯條（220元）、烤花枝（320元）、烤櫛瓜（380元）、鍋燒牛肉澆頭麵（150元）外加一人一杯飲品，飽而不撐的份量搭配一個悠閒的餐後散步，在天朗氣晴的午後，更顯愜意。

脫胎自國民小吃之一的鹹水雞沙拉，有肌肉、黑木耳、花椰菜、筍丁等配料，色澤繽紛口感清爽，是個很好的開胃菜。花枝Q彈櫛瓜（乍看之下我一度以為是小黃瓜）鮮甜，佐著淡淡烤香，很適合來杯拉格作伴。

口味比較重的朋友，建議試試鍋燒牛肉澆頭麵。間單來說，「澆頭」就是淋在飯或麵上的料，所以燴飯也可以說是澆頭料理的一種。我喜歡麵體那個恰到好處的彈牙勁道，搭配濃稠度剛好的澆頭，整體口感相當滑順，尤其是在尾段才漸漸浮現的辛辣，讓人意猶未盡。

外酥內嫩的薯條加上視覺效果十足的容器（是個真的獎盃），冠軍薯條很適合慶功的場合，相當歡樂！澎湃大氣、五彩繽紛的貓下去蜂蜜吐司總匯三明治，蜂蜜與培根的組合呈現溫潤圓滑的口感，帶來厚實飽滿、吮指回味的享受。

而我早就想嘗試的枇杷膏鴛鴦奶茶（200元），原本在菜單上只看到1600ml的超大容量，但店家表示也可以單杯販售，真的讓我覺得好貼心。咖啡的風韻和奶茶的醇厚加上枇杷膏獨特的韻味，在嘴裡構築成一個各有層次卻又相輔相成的循環，優雅中帶點俏皮，相當推薦。

The blessing of friends, the cat went down to the Dunbei Club (""Cat goes down"") to gather together; because it is lunch time, relatively few people are relatively small. Everyone talks about it.

The salted chicken salad, one of the national snacks, has muscles, black fungus, broccoli, bamboo shoots and other ingredients. The color is colorful and refreshing. It is a good appetizer.The flower branch Q bounked melon (at first glance, I thought it was a small cucumber), it was sweet, and it was very suitable for grilled fragrance.

Friends with heavy taste, it is recommended to try the pot to roast beef to pour the head noodles.In terms of list, ""heading"" is the raw of rice or noodles, so risers can also be said to be a type of head.I like the justice of the facade's justice. With the justified head, the overall taste is quite smooth, especially the spicy that gradually emerges at the end of the end, which makes it unsatisfactory.

And I have long wanted to try the creamy milk tea (200 yuan). Originally, I only saw a large capacity of 1600ml on the menu, but the store said that it can also be sold in a single cup, which really makes me feel very intimate.The charm of coffee and the mellow milk of milk tea plus the unique charm of the cream, built a cycle with a layer but complementary, with a little playfulness, a bit playful and recommended.

"貓下去(評論很長，文字拗口，可以去看其他的比較省時)

貓下去位於松山機場附近，民生敦北商圈的一家餐酒館；介於中山國中與台北小巨蛋兩個捷運站，走路約莫十分鐘，開車前往的話，停車還算方便，旁邊就有付費停車場選擇，小巷弄也都有有付費停車格。

有室外餐座，街道裝飾、門面裝潢與招牌，頗有日系東洋風格，中華街的大黃燈籠，招牌根本三鷹之森搬過來的；店內燈光昏黃，裝飾透著木質色調，裝潢東西合併，東方映像搭配西洋搖滾風格，多元且有趣，把氣氛融合的相當好；地下室半開放的廚房，白鐵廚具工業感，餐區木質的餐桌椅與鄉村搖滾，頗具特色。

點了冠軍薯條、蔥油白斬雞、烤鴨與煙燻豬耳朵、烤花枝、炸卜肉、青醬海鮮飯、貓下去招牌涼麵、鹽水雞等，餐點的份量不大，口味偏重，略鹹！所以適合佐酒。

開飯前先上雞湯，冬日稍寒很是暖胃；切很細的冠軍薯條，擺在獎盃上，香蒜沒有搶走馬鈴薯風味，可以搭配沾醬辣油、花生辣醬、豆瓣醬和XO辣醬，蠻爽。烤炸餐點還算新鮮，但切成偏小，相對口感鹹味重，重調味，原汁感展現叫弱。飯麵類，麵體彈口，飯粒分明，皆不軟爛，涼麵真的蠻好吃，一樣醬汁濃厚，食材切法偏細碎，如果喜歡大口吃肉就不適宜。

整體而言，餐點還算精緻，但價格也不菲，價位偏高，對熱量狂熱的年輕人不適合，女孩們倒是量酌適宜。然後口感厚實濃口為主，重調味，重口味，不是清爽路子。

然後，餐酒館不免就是要喝兩杯，酒單看來，酒都具有特色，具有「咩酒」該有的特色，但就是輕酒精為主，你可以好好閱讀酒單，酒單除了字比較小以外，介紹的很文青，文字很唱片歌詞頁，像小本譜，燈光昏暗下好像團練看譜。

不過台北好喝的bar不少，特色當然不在話下，所以這裡酒就是有特色爾爾，適合三五好友偶爾小酌，對酒精結構找醺的人來說，大部分特色酒真的是塞牙縫，要茫持本太高，只能說是眼睛比腸胃更能有酒感的喝兩杯。倒是名稱取的很複雜又很長，所以酒名比酒喝起來有特色，酒體結構沒特別，例如「葡萄柚的寂寞，女人的英倫氣味」，就是葡萄柚、琴酒、威士忌、艾普羅餐前酒、蘇打水，起杯出酒前的橙皮油，這結合不算新鮮，但具特色，只是調製方式很像整桶調好倒進杯子再裝飾的生產感；就喝起來就很輕鬆，小小小酌的人蠻適合，反正餐酒館就是陪著喝，只是酒的價格也不算低就是，若是喝酒為目的的邀約，CP質瞬間變的滿不高。

或許可以點點其他的純酒精，但可能真要喝起來，所費不貲。

外場的服務水準得體，沒被雷到，點菜不寫可以記下，雖說經過訓練，顯得專業，但我覺得也沒有一定要這麼辛苦外場，畢竟好吃好喝親切才是根本，希望你們薪水不錯，然後真的辛苦了。

最後，要來請務必訂位。","Cat goes down (long comments, text is mouthful, you can go to see other more time -saving)

The cat goes down near Songshan Airport, a dining tavern in Minsheng Dunbei Business District; from the two MRT stations of Zhongshan Junior High School and Taipei Dome. It is about ten minutes by walking. The paid parking lot is selected, and the alleys have paid parking.

There are outdoor meals, street decoration, facade decoration and signboards, which are quite Japanese Toyo style. The rhubarb lanterns on Zhonghua Street have been moved by the fundamental three eagle. The image with Western rock style is diverse and interesting, and the atmosphere is quite good; the semi -open kitchen, white iron kitchenware industry, wooden dining tables and chairs and rural rock in the dining area are quite distinctive.

Ordered championship fries, white chopped chicken, roast duck and smoked pig ears, grilled flower branches, fried meat, green sauce seafood rice, cats to sign a sign of cold noodles, salted chicken, etc. salty!So it is suitable for Zujiu.

Before the meal, go to the chicken soup, the cold winter is very cold; the fine championship is placed on the trophy. The garlic does not snatch the potato flavor. It's pretty cool.The baked meals are quite fresh, but they are cut into small, relatively salty taste, heavy seasoning, and the original juice shows weakness.The rice noodles, the noodle bodies, the rice grains are clear, are not soft and rotten, the cold noodles are really delicious, the same sauce is strong, the ingredients are thin and fragmented.

Overall, the meal is exquisite, but the price is not high, and the price is high. It is not suitable for young people with enthusiastic heat. Girls are appropriate.Then the taste is thick and thick, and the taste is mainly refined, and the taste is not refreshing.

Then, the meal tavern can't help but have to drink two glasses. From the perspective of the wine list, the wine has characteristics and has the characteristics of ""wine"", but it is light alcohol. In addition to the young, the text is very young, and the text is very recorded. Like a small score, the lights seem to be a group practice.

However, there are a lot of bars in Taipei. Of course, the features are not the case, so the wine here is specialty. It is suitable for three or five friends to drink occasionally. For those who find alcohol structures, most of the specialty wines are really stuffed. The teeth are too high to hold the vastness. It can only be said that the eyes can drink two glasses more than the stomach.However, the name is very complicated and long, so the name of the wine is more distinctive than the wine. The structure of the wine body is not special. Before meals, soda, orange peel oil before drinking, this combination is not fresh, but it is unique, but the modulation method is very similar to the production feeling of pouring into the cup and decorating. Easy, the small people are quite suitable. Anyway, the dining tavern is to accompany drinking, but the price of the wine is not low. If the invitation for drinking is invited, the CP quality instantly becomes high.

"整體感覺作為酒吧的成分多過於餐廳，裝潢帶有一絲復古感，理所當然的有些吵雜；以酒吧的觀點來說，餐點品質確實蠻好，但以餐廳來說就有些差強人意

又表定90分鐘的用餐時間，不管喝酒吃飯都有點太趕，不過似乎沒有嚴格執行，最後還是待了2小時

招牌涼麵
號稱台北最強涼麵確實是不錯，麵條非常Q彈有勁道，帶著一股爽口的川麻辣味（像全聯的川味麻辣雞絲），胡麻醬有個美乃滋似的溫潤口感讓辣味顯得和緩

冷牛肉芝麻葉
三味醬鹹度蠻高，吃掉芝麻葉的香氣，切成薄片的板腱牛肉口感略韌了點

冠軍薯條
放在獎盃裡上桌蠻有視覺效果的，薯條很細，明顯炸得不夠脆，不過調味上增添萊姆的清新香氣是很棒的想法

炸雞
裹粉老派的炸雞，麵衣有明顯的粉感，雞肉多汁軟嫩，帶著一點薑味（像7-11的屯京炸雞般），不過沒有沾醬略嫌無趣

烤綠蘆筍
頂端口感不錯，尾端沒有處理好粗纖維有些多

蜂蜜起司
諾曼第起司口感紮實，帶著鹹味和適中的奶香，和蜂蜜確實蠻合拍

布丁
布丁甜香柔軟，配玉米片或許是想增加脆口感，但常溫的玉米片吃不大習慣

珍奶
奶茶風味不錯，小珍珠口感也很Q，但稍微有些太甜","The overall feeling as a bar is more than the restaurant, the decoration has a trace of retro, and it is of course noisy. From the perspective of the bar, the quality of the meal is really good, but the restaurant is a bit unsatisfactory for the restaurant.

Signs cold noodle
Known as the strongest cool noodles in Taipei, the noodles are very Q bombs and strong, with a refreshing spicy Sichuan spicy flavor (like the Sichuan flavor spicy chicken shreds), the flax sauce has a similar warm and lipstick to make the spicy taste make the spicy taste make the spicy spicy taste make the spicy spicy feel spicy The taste looks peaceful

Cold beef sesame leaves
The saltiness of Sanwei sauce is quite high, eat the aroma of sesame leaves, and cut into thin slices of plate tendon beef taste slightly tougher

Championship fries
It is quite visual to put on the table in the trophy. The fries are very fine and obviously not fried enough, but it is great to add Lim’s fresh aroma to the seasoning.

fried chicken
The old-fashioned fried chicken wrapped in the noodles has obvious powder, the chicken is juicy and tender, with a little ginger flavor (like the 7-11 Tunjing fried chicken), but it is slightly boring without sauce

Grilled green asparagus
The top taste is good, and there are no more crude fiber at the end of the tail

Honey cheese
Norman's first priest has a solid feeling, with salty and moderate milk fragrance, and honey is really a combination with honey

pudding
Pudding is sweet and soft, and the corn slices may want to increase the crispy taste, but the corn tablets at room temperature are not very used to eating

不明白為什麼店主回覆了我的兩星評論而不是那些只給他一顆星的評論？

我的朋友兩年前來過這家餐廳，當他聽說我們要在這家餐廳吃飯時，他告訴我這家餐廳的飯菜不好吃，並建議我們換到其他餐廳。由於我還願意嘗試一下，因為另一個朋友告訴我這家餐廳的冷麵是台灣最好的，所以我請我的朋友不要換餐廳。

總的來說，服務很好，但食物品質不合格，而且根據食物的口味，價格也很高。
冷麵的味道就像放在冰箱裡過夜的義大利麵一樣。混合竹子配上很多玉米粒？食物的概念對我們來說似乎很荒謬。

我從來沒有吃過慢燉的雞肉，裡面還充滿了血。
我確實要求她問廚師這塊雞肉是否煮熟了。
過了一會兒，她回到我們的餐桌旁，堅持說雞肉沒有問題，但她說如果我們不高興吃它，她不會向我們收取雞肉費用。她最後沒有走開，把雞拿走了。我與她確認，我們會接受她的提議，不從我們的帳單中收取該項目的費用。
當我們正在吃我們點的其他菜餚時，我們甚至還沒有吃甜點，同一位工作人員將賬單蓋在我們桌子的一個桌角上，然後什麼也沒說就走開了。
我們沒有要求帳單。
當我查看賬單時，我們被收取了雞肉費用，所以我走到收銀台，再次與同一位工作人員交談為什麼雞肉菜餚出現在賬單上。她告訴我，因為只有一塊雞肉我們不滿意，所以她不能為我們放棄，但後來她說她這次會破例，我們下次不會點它！
我真的不知道為什麼與她的整個談話她只用普通話而我用英語與她交談。我被告知工作人員都要求英語流利，而我只能聽基本的普通話。

最棒的是他們說他們付出了70%的努力，因此帳單上會收取7%的服務費！

作為歐洲的經常出差的人，我想說這家餐廳的食物和服務低於標準。

My friend told me that this was a very famous restaurant in Taipei so we went to try it.
We ordered a few appetizers and ""desktop semi -chicken"" as the main dish.
When we tried to cut off the chicken, some chickens were not cooked.We asked the person in charge of the restaurant, but she only glanced at it that it was normal because chicken was cooked slowly.
I have never eaten slow -stewed chicken, which is full of blood.
I did ask her to ask the chef's chicken to cook.
After a while, she returned to our table and insisted that there was no problem with chicken, but she said that if we were unhappy to eat it, she would not charge us chicken fees.She didn't go away in the end and took the chicken away.I confirmed that we would accept her proposal and not charge the project from our bill.
When we were eating other dishes we ordered, we didn't even eat desserts. The same staff put the bill on a table corner of our table, and then walked away without saying anything.
We do not ask the bill.
When I checked the bill, we were charged chicken fees, so I walked to the cashier and talked to the same staff why chicken dishes appeared on the bill.She told me that because there was only one piece of chicken, we were not satisfied, so she couldn't give up for us, but later she said that she would make an exception this time, and we would not order it next time!
I really don't know why she only used Mandarin with her entire conversation and I talked to her in English.I was told that the staff asked for fluent English, and I could only listen to basic Mandarin.

The best thing is that they said that they paid 70%of their efforts, so they would charge 7%of the service fee on the bill!

As people who often travel in Europe, I want to say that the food and services of this restaurant are lower than the standard.

"嗯，總的來說，食物還可以，但還沒有嘗試過任何值得再來的東西（我們一行 7 個人，所以從菜單上點了很多菜）。
90分鐘的用餐時間限制是荒謬的，尤其是對於晚晚餐來說，他們只有在你的桌子準備好時才讓你進去（但計時器從你的預訂時間開始），而不是讓我們知道如果之後沒有人我們可以待更長時間我們（結果就是這樣）——工作人員多次強調了 1.5 小時的限制。
椅子/長凳太不舒服（也許還有一件事迫使你不要坐超過 90 分鐘）。
所有的菜餚都價格過高（品質/味道與價格不相比較，顯然...），建議從冰箱中檢查飲料，但冰箱前面的空間妨礙了服務員提供食物，因此您需要不斷地檢查來回走動。正如之前所說，食物還可以（沒什麼哇，有些菜低於平均水平，當然不推薦這裡的海鮮）。
至於服務——在享受我的啤酒時，一位服務員決定用啤酒倒水到我的杯子裡（你不是應該先問一下水的問題嗎……），服務員不斷地踩到我們的腳或把水灑出來。
設計：周圍有太多額外的東西，就像他們試圖佔據盡可能多的位置，而不是只有一個主要概念或風格。
哦，還有一件事——眼鏡碎了——不太酷。
所以絕對不推薦，非常失望不會再回來。","Well, in general, the food is okay, but I haven't tried anything worthwhile (7 people, so we ordered a lot of dishes from the menu).
The 90 -minute dining time limit is ridiculous, especially for dinner, they can only let you go in when you are ready at your table (but the timer starts from your booking time), instead of letting us know that if it will be known if it will be afterwards No one can stay for a longer time (the result is this) -the staff has repeatedly emphasized the 1.5 -hour limit.
The chair/bench is too uncomfortable (maybe there is another thing forcing you not to sit for more than 90 minutes).
