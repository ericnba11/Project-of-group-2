"每次從陽明山回程的騎經中山北路近劍潭捷運站的時候，都會看到這一家外觀真的蠻有味道的餐酒館

特別挑一天平日過來這邊用餐是下午時段1:30之後的時間

看了評論發現這家可能蠻不好訂位的建議大家可以挑離峰時間過來用餐

我想因為餐廳設計的關係
進來之後，可能多少會有聞到一點油煙味
這要提醒第一次來此用餐的朋友們要注意的部分

我想這可能也是，我進店裡之前，有兩組客人都選擇戶外的位置的原因

我覺得其實在適合的天氣跟季節裡面，時間選對的話，其實戶外用餐區用餐應該會是一個很棒的體驗。

提供給大家做選擇參考。

在點餐之前，其實我也是花點時間研究了一下之前Google 評論大家的對餐點評論的部分

因此選了
菲達乳酪干貝燉飯

芝士拼盤

水牛城辣雞翅

藍莓摩德塔

以及
咖啡蘇打

先上來的是芝士拼盤

我從評論上看有人會反應說這個價位太高，但是以我在同價位的比較下我覺得這家的芝士拼盤，是還蠻超值的

上面附上的三種不同的起司，確實是有經過用心挑選的，每種味道跟香氣都是蠻不錯且豐富的

雖然我不是一個專門在品嚐起司的人，但是吃過之後，我蠻推薦尤其是若是有喜好品嚐起司的朋友們，有經過這家店的時候真的不妨點下來豐富你味蕾。

起司拼盤附上了烘焙過還有溫度的堅果類這個是讓我蠻驚艷，這個的確就是會做出與其他店差異化，烘烤後的溫度帶出堅果的香氣，與口感上更加不同的變化，豐富了味蕾，附上的蜂蜜糖漿，搭配一起使用下，整體來說很推薦的

再來就是辣雞翅的部分，這個辣度其實超越我的味蕾和負荷的範圍，畢竟我是比較不常吃辣的人，依稀還是吃的出來蠻有特色的

喜歡吃辣的人，也許可以試試看這一家調出的特別的在酸度跟辣度還有甜度三軸平衡下的特調

再來是燉飯的部分

點餐的時候店員貼心的告訴我說這是義大利米，並詢問是否需要煮久一點的服務？
我覺得這個是一個很好的服務，畢竟義大利米的口感喜好部分還是因人而異

確實我被這一家的干貝燉飯驚艷到。

我先品嚐了單純燉飯本體的部分，新鮮香氣、食材選用搭配的不同口感混合、燉飯醬體的濃郁以及適時部分的清淡，確實是蠻在我預期之外的。

品嚐之後，再單獨品嚐干貝的部分，干貝在外觀上稍微煎燒，在視覺顏色上真的是覺得還蠻不錯，內部口感也是對我來說OK也不會過於老韌。

最後將兩者一起搭配起來一起品嚐，干貝的鮮味有讓整體的頓飯再往上一個層次提升，讚！

而且整體之下，不會因為我請他們幫我煮久一點而影響風味，我想燉飯每個人都有自己的喜好跟想法，也許願意跳出框架的你可能可以來試試看，應該會讓你有一些不同的體會。

藍莓摩德塔
味道細緻豐富，口感隨著送來的時間越久變化帶出更有層次的感受，難怪評論上會這麼多人說來這家就是要吃甜點，確實確實
！
所以就不多說了，直接來吃！就在Google 評論上等著分享你們的體會囉！

總體，我吃完我覺得這個價錢我花得很值得！

咖啡蘇打呢？

整體來說是偏苦，但是因為蘇打水的部分延展咖啡本體的風味，搭配著這家甜點。
我覺得這個設計取向是蠻適合的。

好久沒有在餐酒館坐了這麼久，店家的歌單確實是蠻不錯的，整體感受就等你們自己來體會嘍！

我想等待適合的季節裡，我應該還會再訪，期待在坐在店家戶外用餐的感受！","Every time I return from Yangmingshan to the Jiantan MRT Station in Zhongshan North Road, I will see this dining restaurant with a tasteful appearance

Special picking a day on weekdays here is the time after meals at 1:30 in the afternoon

After watching the comment, I found that this one may be quite difficult to book the place.

I think because of the restaurant design relationship
After coming in, there may be a little smell of oil fume.
This reminds friends who come here for the first time to pay attention to

I think this may also be. Before I entered the store, two groups of guests chose the outdoor location.

In fact, in the suitable weather and the season, if the time is right, in fact, dining out of outdoor dining areas should be a great experience.

Provide you for your choice for reference.

Before ordering, I actually spent some time to study the part of Google commented on the meal comments.

So I chose
Fida cheese dried scallion stew rice

Cheese platter

Bull City spicy chicken wings

Blueberry Modota

as well as
Coffee soda

The cheese platter first comes up first

From the comments, someone will react that the price is too high, but in the same price comparison, I think this cheese platter is quite value for money

The three different cheese attached above are indeed selected by carefully. Each taste and aroma are pretty good and rich.

Although I am not a person who specializes in the cheese, after eating, I recommend it, especially if you have a friend who likes to taste the cheese. When you have this shop, you may really click to enrich your taste buds.

The cheese platter is attached to the baking and temperature nuts. This is amazing. This is indeed differentiated with other stores. The temperature after baking out of the nut The change has enriched the taste buds, and the attached honey syrup is used together.

Then there is the part of the spicy chicken wings. This spicyness actually surpasses my taste buds and loads. After all, I am a relatively spicy person.

Those who like spicy food, maybe you can try the specially transferred to the special of acidity, spicy and spicy, and sweetness under three axis balancing

Then there is the stewed part

When ordering, the clerk told me intimately that this was Italian rice, and asked if he needed a long -term service?
I think this is a good service. After all, the taste preferences of Italian Mi vary from person to person.

Indeed, I was stunned by the stewed rice of this family.

I first tasted the part of the stewed rice body. The fresh aroma and ingredients were mixed with different tastes, the richness of the stew sauce, and the light part of the time.

After tasting, the part of the scallops alone, the scallops are slightly frying in appearance. In terms of visual color, I really feel pretty good, and the internal taste is also OK is not too old.

Finally, taste the two together, and the umami flavor of scallops has the overall meal to improve the upper level, praise!

And overall, I will not affect the flavor because I invite them to help me cook for a long time. I want to stew rice to have their own preferences and ideas. Maybe you may be willing to jump out of the framework. There are some different experiences.

Blueberry Modota
The taste is delicate and rich, and the taste will bring out a more layered feeling as the time you send. No wonder so many people will say that this one is going to eat desserts.
Intersection
So I wo n’t say much, come and eat directly!Just wait for Google's comment to share your experience!

Overall, I think the price is worth it after eating this price!

What about coffee soda?

Overall is bitter, but because of the flavor of the coffee body in the soda, it is paired with this dessert.
I think this design orientation is quite suitable.

I haven't sat in the dining taver for so long for a long time. The store's song list is indeed pretty good. The overall experience is waiting for you to experience it yourself!

I want to wait for the right season, I should visit again, and I look forward to the feelings of sitting at the store outdoors!",False

"今天從天母工作告一段落，預計要直接回台北市，因為自從士林夜市沒落後，其實都是直接油門催著直接無視劍潭捷運站周邊，然而突然想起一件事情，先在中油加油站與站長確認之前內容撰寫無誤後，想說就在附近嘗試逛逛，除了看到一個很排隊很長的餐廳，想想還是回台北市。

就當我要準備騎機車回台北市，剛好餘光掃到一個餐廳，看到餐廳的外型有點偏古典，從外部也可以看到內部的裝潢典雅，是自己喜歡的餐廳類型，在進去餐廳之前先上網查詢「摩德年代-Modism Muses 繆斯餐酒館」，發現我是騎機車，就算想小酌一下似乎也不行，本來打算環拍後再離開，後來和店長洽談了下，他們也有提供餐點，剛好在晚餐還沒用餐時，就乾脆直接就地嘗試看看。

因為今天天氣還不錯，所以選擇做在戶外，靠著捷運邊上，雖然偶爾會聽到淡水捷運通過的聲音，對我這個列車控完全不受影響，後來點未曾吃過的「墨西哥雞肉捲餅」與自己習慣的「拿鐵咖啡」。首先上來的是一瓶酒，其實裡面是裝著開水，沒多久正式的餐點「墨西哥雞肉捲餅」與「拿鐵咖啡」就上桌了，一開始對於這種異國口味的料理，不是很常接觸，服務生也告知因為餐刀有點利，請務必小心使用，想說不就餐刀嗎？後來切了一塊捲餅起來吃，切下去後才發現這個捲餅皮有點硬，很快的切好吃了一口下去後，才發現餅皮又脆又香，加上濃濃的起司香味與鮮嫩的雞肉，就這樣配著咖啡一邊想著工作事情，突然想到「墨西哥雞肉捲餅」，腦袋浮現是曾經吃過的是另外一種類型的，跟這次吃到的風味完全不同，加上旁邊還有酸甜的配料，混著吃又多了不同的層次感。

其實對於今天「墨西哥雞肉捲餅」，未來再訪應該會是當作點心而不會當作主食，因為一份四塊剛好可以跟朋友一起共享，未來可以期待它們其他的餐點；而拿鐵咖啡而言，對我這個拿鐵咖啡控而言大概只有達到及格分數。

4.在回到家查詢後，有發現到他們不同的時段有提供不同的餐點類型，而且提供早午餐，根據每週一到週五、週六到週日營業時間會稍有不同。
5.附近機車位不會太難找，至於汽車位可能還是要看時段而定，因為士林夜市沒落的關係，感覺上車位應該會比較好找。

📝最近到訪日：2021/04/03","Today, from the work of Tianmu, it is expected to return to Taipei directly, because since the Shilin Night Market has not lagged behind, it is actually directly ignoring the surroundings of the Jiantan MRT Station. However, suddenly I think of one thing. After confirming the content of the previous content with the webmaster, I wanted to say that I tried to visit nearby. In addition to seeing a very long -line restaurant, I would like to return to Taipei.

When I was going to prepare a motorcycle to return to Taipei, it happened that Yu Guang was swept to a restaurant. When I saw the appearance of the restaurant is a bit classic, I can also see the internal decoration from the outside. I first checked on the Internet ""Mo Mo's Age-MODISM Muses Muse Restaurant"" and found that I was riding a motorcycle. Even if I wanted to drink it, it didn't seem to work. I originally planned to leave after leaving. Provide meals, just try to see it directly when dinner is not dinner.

Because the weather is not bad today, I chose to do it outdoors and rely on the MRT side. Although I occasionally hear the sound of the Tamsui MRT, it is completely impressed by my train control. Later, the ""Mexican chicken chicken chicken chicken ""Bakery"" ""latte coffee"" with his own habit.First of all, a bottle of wine came up. In fact, it contains boiling water. It didn't take long for the formal meal ""Mexican Chicken Bakery"" and ""Latte Coffee"". In contact, the waiter also informed that because the knife is a bit good, please be careful, do you want to say no dining knife?Later, I cut a piece of burrito and eaten. After cutting it, I found that the cake skin was a bit hard. After a delicious sip, I found that the cake skin was crispy and fragrant. The tender chicken is thinking about work with coffee, and suddenly thinks of ""Mexican chicken burrier"". The head of the head has eaten another type. It is completely different from the flavor of this time. In addition There are also sweet and sour ingredients next to it.

In fact, for today's ""Mexican Chicken Bakery"", the future visit should be used as dim sum, not as a staple food, because one or four can be shared with friends, and they can look forward to their other meals in the future; and Latteci For my coffee, for my latte coffee control, only the score is reached.

"已經是2次回訪了。

第1次來時吃已是晚餐時間，點了兩份義大利麵跟炸魚薯條，從字面上來看其實沒太多想法，沒想到卻是以創新的料理手法呈現！其中干貝蝦醬義大利麵，干貝煎得鮮嫩多汁、恰到好處，吃得出干貝的鮮甜，同時也享受得到干貝表面微微的焦脆，以蝦為主體的醬汁包裹著義大利麵條，矛盾的味覺衝擊，卻又如此地和諧可口，令人忍不住一口接一口，即使現在想起仍忍不住口水直流🤤而炸魚薯條亦彷彿藝術品般，薯條是如築巢的細枝彼此交錯纏繞，配上小小的炸鮮魚條，宛如法式料理的裝盤，完全推翻英式炸魚薯條的刻板印象，缺點是份量較小，無法當作一個餐來食用。很可惜這次用餐沒有拍照，期待下次再訪，我會補拍照片跟大家分享。

2訪時終於趕上早午餐時間，薯餅是我喜歡的細絲薯餅，口感層次豐富，其他班尼迪克蛋、荷蘭醬、燻鮭魚等就表現一般，雖然吃了不到令人眼睛為之一亮，但整體表現非常好，不論是餐點或是咖啡都水準之上，是間讓人會想一再回訪的餐廳👍

提醒想去品嚐的各位，記得先電話預約保留位置，另外這也是寶寶友善餐廳，雖然餐廳不大，但會願意安排足夠的空間放娃娃車。
另外需注意的一點是，餐廳是很講究自然風的，所以時常會將門板打開通風，在意蚊蟲或者二手煙的朋友請謹慎前往，不要讓這些因素影響了用餐心情，進而影響了送入口中的美食喔！","It's already two times.

It was dinner time when I came for the first time. I ordered two pasta and frying fish and potato strips. Literally, there was not much idea. I did n’t expect it to be presented with innovative cooking methods!Among them, dried scallops and shrimp sauce are marching noodles. The scallops are fried and tender and juicy. It is just right. It can eat the sweetness of the shells. At the same time, it also enjoys the slightly crispy surface of the scallops. The impact of the taste is so harmonious and delicious, it can't help but take a bite, even if I still can't help but still be able to drool, the fried fish and potatoes are like art. They are staggered and wrapped with each other, with a small fried fish bar, like a French dish, which completely overthrows the stereotype of British fried fish and potatoes. The disadvantage is that the portion is small and cannot be eaten as a meal.It is a pity that I did n’t take a picture of this meal. I look forward to the next visit, I will make a photo to share with you.

At the time of the visit, I finally caught up with brunch time. Potato cakes are my favorite brilliant sweet potato cakes. The taste is rich. Other Bennyk eggs, Dutch sauce, smoked salmon, etc. One of them is bright, but the overall performance is very good. Whether it is meals or coffee, it is a restaurant that makes people want to return repeatedly.

Remind everyone who wants to taste, remember to make an appointment for the retention location first. In addition, this is also a baby friend's good restaurant. Although the restaurant is not large, he will be willing to arrange enough space to put a doll car.
In addition, it should be noted that the restaurant is very particular about natural style, so often opens the door panel. Friends who care about mosquitoes or second -hand smoke, please go with caution. Do not let these factors affect the mood of the meal, and then affect the delivery of the entrance to the mouth Food!",False

"首次用餐就體驗二樓包場（低消一人一千，不限人數），我和朋友兩人花2000初就享有整個二樓空間三小時！

二樓空間很大，小角落佈置的很適合拍網美照，且也有專屬廁所，唯一缺點是冷氣不夠強，夏天如果坐靠窗側會有點熱，但慶幸包場，可以自由換座位坐在冷氣出風口處！

餐點最好吃的是甜點！覆盆子乳酪派非常好吃！派皮是巧克力味，覆盆子酸甜不膩，非常解暑開胃！店家還貼心的灑上生日快樂的字樣為我朋友慶生～
酒漬柑橘乳酪也不錯吃，味道濃，只是比較容易吃膩，而且一小塊200真的蠻貴的。

沙拉的部分調味普通，但份量算大，還行。
墨西哥雞肉捲餅上桌時熱熱的好吃～配上番茄墨西哥辣椒的莎莎醬(?)很絕配！
鹹派本身也不錯吃，惟旁邊的沙拉也是很普通，頗可惜😢
主餐的義大利麵偏普通，蝦子大隻有剝好殼，食用方便！

調酒部分點了兩杯，一杯梅酒&一杯小舞曲，清爽解膩沒什麼酒感的調酒，價格分別是300和320，中等價位，尚可～

The space on the second floor is very large, and the small corner is suitable for taking beautiful photos of the net, and there are also exclusive toilets. The only disadvantage is that the air conditioning is not strong enough. If you sit on the window on the side of the window, it will be a bit hot. At the air outlet!

The best food for meals is dessert!The raspberry cheese school is very delicious!Pai Pippi is chocolate. The raspberry is sweet and sour and not greasy, and it is very appetizing!The store also sprinkled with a happy birthday to celebrate my friend's birthday ~
Alcoholic citrus cheese is also good, taste strong, but it is easier to eat, and a small piece of 200 is really expensive.

Part of the salad is ordinary, but the amount is large and okay.
Mexican chicken pork cakes are hot and delicious when they are served on the table ~ Sasa sauce with tomato Mexican pepper (?) Is very perfect!
The Xianpai itself is also good, but the salad next to it is also very ordinary, it is a pity
The pasta of the main meal is ordinary. The shrimp is only peeled with the shell, which is easy to eat!

The bartending section ordered two glasses, a glass of plum wine & a cup of small dance music, refreshing and non -alcoholic bartending, the price is 300 and 320 respectively, the medium price is available ~

"2023年和朋友用餐的心得
1.從訂位開始就不太順利，同個時段第一通電話說沒位置了，第二通又說有，前後距離不到幾分鐘

2.到場後，一樓空位還很多，幫我們安排在一個全身都能曬到太陽的位置

3.點餐時店員要求要到櫃台點，走去旁邊找櫃台後，店員從頭到尾站在原地沒移動+眼睜睜看著我們走大半圈找櫃臺後才說：櫃台在這裡。對，我們坐在櫃台旁邊那桌，店員點餐完全不用移動，我們就走回去位置上，然後站著跟店員說要什麼餐點，可能不喜歡我們坐著他站著？

4.結帳時店員詢問餐點口味，表示柳橙果汁太苦了、餐點太鹹而且一直吃到蒜皮，店員表示之後可以加糖，另外因為是餐酒館，可以點清淡口味的餐點，另外蒜皮是正常的。
但，已經是點清淡口味的餐點了，柳橙果汁的部分，苦到跟苦瓜有得比，另外朋友點的吐司品項過濕，難吃到朋友吃幾口就不吃了，店員表示餐點這樣是正常的。

5.上述體驗感非常之差，價格也不低，店員態度超差又傲慢，還要求服務費，像是餐點口味的部分，完全擺出一副：我們的果汁完全沒問題，你吃不了苦我們願意發善心給你糖，的態度。總之是一間餐點正常發揮但口味對我們一行三人來說不佳、服務態度也差並且需要服務費用的店。","The experience of dining with friends in 2023
1. It is not smooth from the beginning of the order. The first phone call said that there is no place in the same time, and the second pass is said.

2. After arriving, there are still a lot of empty position on the first floor, and help us arrange to get in the sun in a whole body.

3. When ordering, the clerk asked to go to the counter. After walking around to find the counter, the clerk stood in place from beginning to end without moving+watching us after walking a large circle to find the counter before saying: The counter is here.Yes, we sat at the table next to the counter. The clerk did not need to move at all. We walked back to the position, and then stood to tell the clerk what meals. Maybe we didn't like us sitting on him?

4. When checking out, the clerk asked the taste of the meal, saying that the orange fruit juice was too bitter, the meal was too salty, and it was eaten until garlic. The clerk said that he could add sugar later. In addition, garlic is normal.

《小山園培茶塔》$200：店員說是冷凍的，所以要趕快吃，不然會出水。有著冰淇淋的口感，培茶香味濃厚，算是對得起他的價位

《焦糖蘋果磅蛋糕》$130：其實認真說起來還好，中規中矩，優點就是難得焦糖蘋果系列沒有放肉桂！！ 怕肉桂的人可以好好享用🤤

"在士林捷運站二號出口大約走5分鐘就可以到了，滿大的一棟建築物，很顯眼。

臨時決定前往嘗試，畢竟是餐酒館酒精類飲品選擇很多，還有沙拉、炸物、麵等食物。

這次點了洋甘菊茶、破冰船（調酒）、沙拉（油醋）和炸魚薯條（如圖，炸魚是魚條不是像英國那種真的大魚塊，滿好咬的。提供的醬有辣味，爽口；薯條就很特別，像是台式小點心雞汁麵的那種脆馬鈴薯細條？我個人吃的比較不習慣，原以為是一般的薯條🍟，這種吃起來帶苦味）

餐館整體氛圍是好的，生意不錯，人不斷前來造訪。二樓的座位是需要事先預約的，臨時來的客人大都做一樓（小圓桌）

"在餐酒館還沒開幕前就去咖啡廳造訪過了
剛開幕時本來很期待但去過多次以後覺得似乎沒有再消費的必要了

👉第一次造訪
整體上沒有大問題
但是坐窗邊有一隻蟲飛來飛去
然後有小孩非～～～常吵
店員似乎沒有要管的意思

👉第二次造訪
恰逢情人節
訂位使用Line，被告知有情人節套餐，也預定了
當天到了現場之後被告知：
1.「沒有訂位資料」
2. 「情人節套餐還沒開始供應」
店員看了Line並詢問主廚之後，告知確實是還沒開始供應，並提供一份甜點當作補償

👉第三次造訪
青豆燉飯裡出現塑膠片，反應了之後有廚房人士出來詢問，雖然態度沒有不好，但加了一句「在廚房沒有找到對應的物品」讓人有種被懷疑的感覺，但事實上碎片是從燉飯深處挖出來的，我不太能理解我們要怎麼偷放在燉飯深處，事後得到一份餐點（小漢堡）做補償

👉第四次造訪（預定2樓）
基本上也沒有太大問題，只是當下看到菜單有更換，但並沒有從臉書、ig得到消息。

二樓空間比一樓舒適非常多，如果人不多的話真的很適合聚會約會。

👉第五次造訪
坐在牆角的位置，進門坐下沒多久後身後出現4隻黑色的蟲，和店員反應後店員有來抓。
廚房油煙味重，而且可以一直看到廚房冒出很多煙，不太知道廚房設備是否出了什麼問題。

總結：
雖然可能每次遇到事情當下反應都有「被解決」，但來5次遇到3次雷事實在是機率有點太高，可見店家在管理經營和維持環境上真的有很大的進步空間

若之後沒有改善大概不會考慮再去，雖然食物很好吃，但遇到事情當下真的心情會被影響，補償機制應該是用在緊急情況而不是用補償掩蓋經營不善。","I went to the cafe to visit before the dining tavern opened
I was looking forward to it when I first opened, but after I had been there many times, I felt that there was no need to consume anymore.

👉 The first visit
There is no big problem as a whole
But there is a worm flying around the window and flying around
Then there are children who are not ~~~ often noisy
The clerk does not seem to be in control

👉The second visit
Coinciding with Valentine's Day
Use LINE to book a place, and I was told that there is a lover's day package, and I have booked it
After arriving at the scene that day, he was told:
1. ""No booking information""
2. ""Valentine's Day package has not started to supply yet""
After the clerk looked at LINE and asked the chef, he informed that it did not start supplying, and provided a dessert as compensation as compensation

👉 The third visit
Plastic films appeared in green bean stewed rice. After reacting, some kitchen people came out to ask. Although the attitude was not bad, the addition of ""no corresponding items found in the kitchen"" made people feel suspicious, but in fact the fragments are the pieces is the fragmentation is the fragmentation is the fragmentation. Dig out from the depths of the stew, I don't understand how we steal the depths of the stew, get a meal (small burger) for compensation afterwards

预 The fourth visit (scheduled 2nd floor)
Basically, there are not much problems, but I saw that the menu was changed at the moment, but I did not get the news from Facebook and IG.

The space on the second floor is much more comfortable than the first floor. If there are not many people, it is really suitable for party and date.

👉 Fifth visit
Sitting at the corner, there were 4 black worms behind the door after entering the door. After responding to the clerk, the clerk came to catch it.
The kitchen oil and smoke are heavy, and you can always see a lot of smoke emerging in the kitchen. I don't know if the kitchen equipment is wrong.

Summarize:
Although there may be ""resolved"" every time you encounter something, you have three thunder facts in 5 times. The probability is a bit too high.

If it is not improved in the future, it will probably not consider it. Although the food is delicious, it will be affected by the fact that it will be affected at the moment. The compensation mechanism should be used in emergencies rather than compensation.",False
態度超級差，而且完全沒什麼服務卻要收10%服務費，只想開開心心的慶生但真的被店員搞到不太開心～上餐慢就算了連服務也是愛理不理的，希望態度改善😊,"The attitude is super poor, and there is no service at all, but it has to charge 10%of the service fee.

"環境優美，咖啡值得品嚐。但是下午進店沒被告知有限時，後來有服務生告知剩餘十五分鐘，但我們想加點晚餐也不行繼續留。空五桌沒人候位還要趕人，不懂這邏輯。

Later, some waiters informed the remaining fifteen minutes, but we wanted to add some dinner and continued to stay.No one is waiting for the five tables to catch people, and does not understand this logic.

Thanks to the store for the solution, sorry that the people did not take the entire menu carefully, did not see the time limit for meals, and paid money to drink coffee and used computers in the place where they were eating. It was really wrong.I will not disturb your stores next time, hinder other guests' meals.",False

這是我台灣之旅最喜歡的地方！超舒適的酒吧/咖啡館，非常有美感。服務非常熱情，主人也非常熱情。逛完士林夜市後，與朋友一起吃點東西或喝點飲料的絕佳場所。期待有一天回來。,"This is my favorite place in Taiwan!The super comfortable bar/cafe is very beautiful.The service is very enthusiastic and the owner is very enthusiastic.After visiting the Shilin Night Market, eat something with friends or drink some drinks.Looking forward to one day back.",False
每個人進咖啡館都要點一杯飲料，每杯至少100新台幣，你的帳單已經開始顯得很高了。加上160元幣的3塊小抹茶磅蛋糕，你的時間最好花在7-11。咖啡不是特別好，你最好在家自己煮一杯。服務不是特別好，這增加了您令人失望的體驗。這家咖啡館唯一的優點就是氣氛，這絕對是太棒了。環境照明和酒瓶裝飾完美地實現了這一點，增添了品質感。,"Everyone enters a cafe to order a drink. At least 100 NT $ 100 per cup, your bill has begun to look high.With the three small matcha cakes of 160 yuan, your time is best to spend 7-11.Coffee is not particularly good, you'd better cook a drink at home.The service is not particularly good, which increases your disappointing experience.The only advantage of this cafe is the atmosphere, which is definitely great.Environmental lighting and wine bottle decoration perfectly achieve this, adding a sense of quality.",False
舒適而燈光昏暗的街角咖啡館讓我彷彿回到了歐洲。我們喝了咖啡和巧克力餡餅——棒極了。,The comfortable and dim street corner cafe made me feel like returning to Europe.We drank coffee and chocolate pie -great.,False
來這裡絕對是為了這裡的氛圍而不是食物；這個地方很親密，有歐洲「沙龍」的氛圍。房子🍷很好，但是食物+飲料加起來$$$。你在櫃檯點餐，服務生不會打擾你。音樂（一些流行音樂）與空間不太匹配。為了結束這個夜晚，不得不點一份他們的美學餡餅。得到了百香果，這是帶有黑巧克力皮的餡餅。感覺這是最「值得」的項目... …,"It is definitely for the atmosphere here instead of food here; this place is very close and has the atmosphere of European ""salons.""The house is very good, but the food+drinks add up to $ $ $.If you order at the counter, the waiter will not disturb you.Music (some popular music) does not match space.In order to end this night, they have to order their aesthetic pie.Get Passion Fruit, this is a pie with dark chocolate skin.It feels like this is the most ""worth"" project ... ...",False
他們的食物非常美味，而且就位於地鐵站附近。以後來士林一定還會再去的。強烈推薦。,"Their food is very delicious and located near the subway station.In the future, Shilin will definitely go again.Strongly recommended.",False
"美麗的裝飾、舒適的氛圍和美味的牛肉燴飯——這些絕對是亮點。這個地方絕對是華麗的，它（幾乎）讓我忘記了預訂的相當不愉快的過程。
我們給餐廳打的前兩次電話非常匆忙，工作人員打斷了我們的話。
只能透過 LINE 進行預訂。我留下了英文名字預訂，卻被嚴厲地要求只能用中文名字預訂。雖然在解釋我們是外國人並且餐廳最終接受了我們的預訂後，我們發現整個情況相當不專業和不舒服。

用餐期間的服務很好，只是我們的食物花了超過 45 分鐘才送上來。總而言之，亮點很棒，但還有改進的空間。會回來看看再次麻煩是否值得。","Beautiful decoration, comfortable atmosphere and delicious beef risks -these are definitely highlights.This place is definitely gorgeous, and it (almost) has forgotten that the booking is quite unpleasant.
The first two calls we called the restaurant were very hurried, and the staff interrupted our words.
You can only book through LINE.I left the English name reservation, but I was severely requested that I could only book it in Chinese.Although we are explaining that we are foreigners and the restaurant finally accepts our booking, we find that the whole situation is quite unprofessional and uncomfortable.

The service during the meal is very good, but our food takes more than 45 minutes before it is delivered.All in all, the highlight is great, but there is room for improvement.Will come back to see if it is worth it again.",False
到達後被告知，除了過道上的一張桌子外，他們已經訂滿了，儘管還有多張桌子空閒。我們的訂單大約 15 分鐘就分別出來了，而且不是很好。工作人員很少關注，除非你主動聯繫並覺得洗碗比清理桌子更重要。非常令人失望，沒有回去。,"After arriving, they were told that they were full except for a table on the aisle, although there were still many tables of idleness.Our orders come out in about 15 minutes, and it is not very good.Staff rarely pays attention, unless you take the initiative to contact and feel that washing dishes is more important than cleaning the table.Very disappointing, not going back.",False
"餐廳

食物其實很好，但份量太小。
我吃了義大利麵，差不多300台幣，吃完還是很餓。幸運的是我點了別的東西。

數量會更大，我會進行第四次啟動。

甜點太冷了，應該等 5/10 分鐘再上菜。

室內設計很棒，工作人員也很好。","Dining room

The food is actually very good, but the portion is too small.
I ate the pasta, almost 300 Taiwan dollars, and I was still hungry after eating.Fortunately, I ordered something else.

The quantity will be larger, and I will start the fourth time.

The dessert is too cold, you should wait for 5/10 minutes before serving.

The interior design is great and the staff is also very good.",False
"非常漂亮舒適的地方，外面有桌子。非常適合放鬆。沒有嘗試食物，但打開了一瓶酒。他們需要調查什麼：
酒單非常有限。
我點了最貴的白酒Nt1500
稍微冷藏一下，而不是應有的冷度。
盛在紅酒杯中。他們沒有白葡萄酒杯
他們不會要求你品嚐葡萄酒。
不得不要冰桶——裡面裝滿了水，幾乎沒有冰。
😔 這是一個遺憾，因為其他地方都很可愛","Very beautiful and comfortable place, there are tables outside.Very suitable for relaxation.I didn't try food, but opened a bottle of wine.What do they need to investigate:
The wine list is very limited.
I ordered the most expensive liquor NT1500
Refrust a little, not the coldness.
Sheng in the wine glass.They have no white wine glass

I have to have the ice bucket -it is filled with water inside, and there is almost no ice.
