四人的分享餐餐前麵包一般，洋蔥湯味道很甜很奇怪，無骨雞翅燉飯味道很淡一度懷疑是不是忘了放鹽，披薩的味道不錯，慢烤美國頂級帶骨牛小排很軟爛加一些鹽味道更讚，嫩煎牛舌味道也偏淡，甜點巴斯克乳酪蛋糕屬於水水款的而非厚實的口感，我個人比較喜歡厚實的口感。四人的份量相當足夠，用料非常實在但料理就⋯對還有薯泥因該沒有放奶油味道也好奇怪,"The four -person sharing meal front bread is average. The flavor of the onion soup is very sweet and strange. The flavor of boneless chicken wings stewed rice is very light. I doubted whether it was forgotten to put the salt. The pizza taste was good. Soft rotten and some salt flavor is even better, and the tender fried beef tongue tastes lighter. Dessert Basque cheese cake belongs to the water model instead of thick taste. I personally prefer a thick taste.The quantity of the four is quite enough, the ingredients are very solid, but the cooking is not good for the taste of potato puree because it should not be creamy."
2年多前曾入住，非常喜歡英迪格的精緻的早餐，這次透過旅展購入多張早餐卷，平假日皆可使用非常划算，雖然沒有以往的海鮮粥及班尼克蛋，但假日可以和家人在此悠閒的享用早餐，還是覺得很超值。４Ｆ用餐環境明亮位子非常寬敝，還可以看到１０１，雖然客滿但不覺得擁擠，取餐也不需要排隊，不像其他５星飯店早餐，沒有用餐時間限制真的很優。,"I stayed in more than 2 years ago and liked Ideig's delicate breakfast very much. This time I bought a number of breakfast scrolls through the travel exhibition. It can be used very cost -effective. Although there are no previous seafood porridge and Bennek eggs, but Holidays can enjoy breakfast with their families with their families, and they still feel very good value.4F's dining environment is very bright. You can also see 101. Although it is full but not crowded, you don't need to line up for meals. Unlike other 5 -star restaurants breakfast, there is no meal time limit."
"推薦威靈頓牛排～
要記得先預訂！
外酥內嫩 牛排完全剛剛好🤩
單點的牛舌也很推薦👍🏼
另外還點了聖誕的雙人套餐～
餐點都很好吃 很滿意
但就是份量過多 後來都打包帶回家
過節很推薦來這唷！氣氛也讚讚","Recommend Wellington steak ~
Remember to book first!
Crispy inner and tender steak is just right 🤩
Single -point beef tongue is also very recommended 舌
Also ordered the two -person set meal for Christmas ~
The meals are delicious and satisfied
But when the portion is too large, they will be packed and brought home
It is recommended to come here during the holidays!The atmosphere is also praised"

🍴嫩肩牛舌
🍴爆米花濃湯

🍽️西班牙塞拉諾火腿披薩
🍽️無骨雞翅燉飯

🍰巴斯克乳酪蛋糕

🍵晨光草原甘菊花茶

牛舌切得非常厚實，外脆內軟的口感，配上同樣厚切的節瓜有著類似的口感與飽足感，龍蒿美乃滋又再加上一層草本的風味，非常喜歡。

爆米花濃湯偏甜且濃稠，配料還有玉米顆粒與玉米筍，加入爆米花應是取代麵包丁但個人口味不好甜口，且爆米花並不像麵包一樣能吸附湯汁，反而會呈現濕軟的狀態。

雞翅燉飯很貼心的去骨，烤的多汁美味，口味上是松露野菇燉飯，給的菌菇非常足夠，也將焦化做得很好香氣十足，入口非常濃郁且滑順。

環境與服務有飯店式經營與管理的品質，部分開放式廚房讓後台處理完的菜品在客人眼前做組裝，卻能避免油煙熏天。

菜品上份量都很足，但價位上就是飯店價位，認為很適合多人聚餐的場所。

🍴 tender shoulder beef tongue
汤 🍴 🍴 🍴 🍴 🍴

拉 ️ Spanish Serano ham pizza
炖️ Boneless chicken wings stewed rice

Basque cheese cake

甘Chenuang Grassland Chamomilea tea

The beef tongue is very thick, the crispy and soft texture, with the same thick cut melon, has a similar taste and satiety. Dragon Artemisini Masisi adds a layer of herbal flavor. I like it very much.

The popcorn soup is sweet and thick, and the ingredients also have corn particles and corn bamboo shoots. Adding popcorn should replace the bread but the person's taste is not good, and the popcorn can not absorb soup like bread. Show a soft state.

Chicken wings stewed rice is very intimate, the juicy and delicious roasted, and the taste is truffle wild mushroom stewed rice. The mushrooms given to the mushrooms are very sufficient. It also makes the coking very well. The entrance is very rich and smooth.

The environment and services have the quality of restaurant -style operation and management. Some open kitchen allows the background to be assembled in front of the guests, but it can avoid oil smoke.

The dishes are sufficient, but the price is the price of the hotel, and it is considered a place for multi -person dinner.

"牛舌很嫩美味！漢堡肉紮實有勁！很喜歡。不過服務生好像有點記不住我們點的東西（明明客人也不多。也有寫下來），菜送上桌還會記錯每個人點的東西。（這在高級餐廳真的罕見。）
另外廁所真的很臭。好像是清潔時的拖把有霉味的那種臭味，整個廁所都是那種公廁味，廁所又不通風，一進去就真的很想立刻離開。","The beef tongue is tender and delicious!Hamburg meat is strong and strong!I like it very much.However, the waiter seems to be a bit unable to remember what we ordered (there are not many guests. It is also written), and the dishes will remember what everyone ordered.(This is really rare in high -end restaurants.)
In addition, the toilet is really smelly.It seems to be the smell of mildew when cleaning. The whole toilet is the kind of public toilet flavor, and the toilet is not ventilated. As soon as you enter, you really want to leave immediately."
"今天部門聚餐 來到T.R Bar& Kitchen
一開始氛圍還不錯, 服務生也很親切
但從小細節來看… 不知從何時開始變調了…

部份同事沒有被詢問是要氣泡水還是一般礦泉水？
也沒有被詢問是否要加檸檬片？
沒有事先詢問餐後飲料是什麼？導致用完餐後 大家等了半小時 飲料才上齊…
沙拉部分 也未曾詢問是否有人不吃生食,直接統一醃鮭魚培根沙拉
前菜是全部餐點中勉強還行的….
再來主菜方面 更是慘不忍睹！！
在大家入座的時候, 各自發了主菜的肉品項名牌 放在每個人的座位上……
結果服務生還可以將豬肉排餐 上給 點牛排的同事？？？
結果同事吃到一半 他們才跑過來說不好意思 上錯餐點,直接收回!??
接著全部人都上完主餐, 就我跟另外一位點伊比利豬主菜的同事 一直遲遲沒有拿到,(期間我們不斷催餐), 然後半個小時過去了… 終於拿到主菜,而其他同事們都吃完他們的了……………
接著有人反應她的牛排熟度是否太熟了…(據同事描述, 點牛排的同事 事前都未被詢問需要的熟度是什麼),完完全全取決於主廚的心情？？ 所以有人三分 有人五分有人七八分, 而反應牛排熟度是否正常的這位拿到了將近全熟…  結果服務生蹲下來解釋…這份 “伊比利豬餐點”熟度 是沒問題的？？？
接著說我拿到的伊比利豬餐點… 我第一次看到伊比利豬有血水的,撥開擺盤 豬肉一堆筋跟奇怪的油花不均勻, 切開來還有點微粉紅, 結果嚼嚼嚼 味道之怪又難咬, 勉強吞下去後,喝口檸檬水, 嘴巴裡的豬騷味讓人感到不舒服,決定吃個配菜(玉米筍) 不敢說是臭酸, 但絕對有帶酸味！ 吃下來的感受 非常的差！！！
只好立馬吐掉，狂喝水………………
跟主管反應後, 讓他客訴去……
再來 餐後飲料 服務生又花了快半小時 確認大家的飲料品項後, 又有一兩位同仁 隔了快20分鐘才拿到熱飲………
這次用餐體驗 真的刷新三觀耶！！！
要來吃這間店的 ……… 請 三 思！！！！！","Today's department dinner came to T.R Bar & Kitchen

Some colleagues are not asked if they want to bubble water or general mineral water?
Didn't be asked if you want to add lemon?
What is the drink after the meal?As a result, everyone waited for half an hour after the meal before the meal ...

因為沒吃過威靈頓牛排特別來嚐嚐，點了爆米花濃湯、兩道蔬菜跟威靈頓牛排，除了一開始的麵包是冷的很硬以外，其他都中規中矩，威靈頓牛排裡面的牛肉滿香的。壽星會送一個小蛋糕。,"Because I have never eaten Wellington Steak, I have special tasks. I ordered the popcorn soup, two vegetables and Verlton steak. Except for the bread at the beginning, the bread was cold and hard. The beef is fragrant.Shouxing will give a small cake."
"訂位11:30但12:00才能入坐，櫃檯接待人員的態度很好，請我們先去旁邊的沙發區稍候，餐廳整體裝潢很美✨

過年期間沒有4人分享套餐，有點可惜，所以改點個人套餐。

切片法國麵包冷冷的、口感偏軟，如果能烤熱一點再上桌會更好～最喜歡前菜的鮑魚干貝以及主餐肋眼牛排😋","Rooking at 11:30 but 12:00 can be settled. The attitude of the counter reception staff is very good. Please go to the sofa area next to the sofa area. The overall decoration of the restaurant is very beautiful.

No 4 people shared the package during the Chinese New Year, so it is a pity, so change some personal packages.

Slice French bread is cold and soft. It would be better if you can bake hot and then serve it ~ I like the abalone scallops of the former dish and the main meal rib eye steak 😋"
"威靈頓牛排（要先預訂 付全額）- 非常大一個  2人吃的話 其實也可以 不過就不要再點其他料理了🤣 廚師會到桌邊表演 切牛排的刀法很厲害 擺盤等等 非常精緻

外酥內嫩 真低好吃 不會油 牛排嫩嫩到不行 （我不愛吃酥皮的人都誠實發表 真的比起一般餐廳來說 好好吃！）撇除中間松露蘑菇 個人真的不喜歡這個哈哈哈哈 就會讓牛排乾乾的東西變成濕濕的 很討厭 對我來說是扣分

配菜蘆筍節瓜- 都很好吃 恰到好處 解膩
馬鈴薯泥- 爆幹好吃 感覺是有點奶油？ 不會太油 很滑順 估溜估溜的 一下就沒了 碰到口水就化開

凱撒雞肉沙拉- 感覺凱薩醬太少 嘻嘻的 味道頗淡 其餘正常 乾淨蔬菜的概念

麵包- 好像可以續 忘記了 加奶油也很好吃 止餓🤣

店員會推薦一個沙拉或湯 然後威靈頓牛排 兩個女生吃不完 太多了 等到威靈頓上餐的時候 已經被沙拉餵飽了

水可以選氣泡水或一般水 可續加 忘記要不要錢了

可坐窗邊或外面 看夜景 很漂亮 高級餐廳 環境乾淨

可刷卡

店員是加分點！店員超貼心（不知道484每一個都這樣）會幫忙拍照 然後給人一種很親切的感覺 雖然是高級餐廳 但不會很遠 就很像自己朋友在幫你服務的感覺？！非常可愛 服務滿分","Wellington steak (to book the full amount first) -The is a very large one. If you eat it, you can actually order other dishes. Exquisite

The outer crispy is really low and delicious, and the oily steak is so tender (I do n’t like to eat meringue, and everyone who does n’t like to eat plasma is honest than ordinary restaurants!) If you like this hahahaha, you will make the steak dry into wet and hate it. I hate it. It is a deduction for me.

Pau as the asparagus festivals-all delicious just right to dissolve the greasy
Potato puree-Dry dry and delicious feel is a bit cream?It's not too oily, smooth, and slippery.

Caesar chicken salad-I feel that Caesar sauce is too little, hehe, the concept of the rest of the normal clean vegetables

Bread-It seems that I can forget to forget that the cream is also delicious and hungry.

The clerk will recommend a salad or soup, and then the two girls of the Wellington steak can't finish eating too much. Wait until Wellington will be fed by the salad

Water can choose gas bubble water or general water can be forgotten if you forget it.

You can sit by the window or outside to watch the night view very beautiful and the high -end restaurant environment is clean

Credit card

The clerk is a bonus point!The clerk is super cared (I don't know 484 each) will help take pictures and give people a very kind feeling. Although it is a high -end restaurant, it will not be far like your friends are helping you serve you?IntersectionVery cute service full score"
"和朋友約十個人來聚餐，坐開放座位區但場地很大不會覺得擁擠。
餐點好吃又份量十足，每一道餐點的份量以我們幾個女孩子來說可以分三個人吃沒問題，建議組團來吃可以享用到更多不同口味的佳餚。
無骨雞翅燉飯裡的松露味讓人印象深刻，料理整體調味偏清淡，更能突顯新鮮松露的氣味，吃起來不會讓人覺得有負擔。
爆米花濃湯是個聽起來就很新穎的料理，其實喝起來就像加了爆米花的濃厚玉米濃湯，適合喜歡甜口濃湯的人！
瑪格麗特披薩十分推薦給喜歡起司的人，起司超厚一層吃起來超滿足！
這次的主要目標「威靈頓牛排」是分享餐，一份大約能分成四個人吃，我們十個人吃兩份牛排剛剛好，牛肉不會過熟鮮嫩多汁，加上內層的蘑菇醬和烤得酥脆美味的麵衣真的一絕🤤","About ten people with friends to dinner, sitting on the open seat area, but the venue will not feel crowded.
The meal is delicious and full. The amount of each meal is based on a few girls. It is no problem to eat three people. It is recommended that groups to eat more different flavors.
The flavor of the truffles in the boneless chicken wings is impressive. The overall seasoning of cooking is light, which can highlight the smell of fresh truffles. It will not make people feel burdensome.
Jump rice flowers are a dish that sounds very novel. In fact, it is like a thick corn soup with popcorn, which is suitable for people who like sweet soup!
Margaret Pizza is very recommended to those who like cheese, and the cheese is super thick to eat!
The main goal of this time ""Wellington Steak"" is to share meals. One can be divided into four people to eat. Ten people eat two steaks just right. The beef will not be cooked and tender. The crispy and delicious noodles are really a must"
"好吃、餐廳氣氛好。湯品我全點過，好喝是好喝，就是好像少了一味.. 爆米花濃湯喝起來感覺身體負擔很大,too rich.","The delicious atmosphere of the restaurant is good.I have a little bit of soup, delicious taste is delicious, that is, it seems that it is missing .. Juanmi Huasong Decoction feels a lot of burden. TOO RICH."
"4/6晚上6點半入場
威靈頓牛排需要提前預定
總結是可吃威靈頓牛排，套餐就算了吧~環境還扣分。

當天點了套餐1,600元+威靈頓牛排享用，會有麵包可無限享用，但上餐速度太慢，導致沒事做事時一直吃麵包，整場吃完已經9點半了，若不含點餐前置半小時也花了2個小時半。吃完很飽，但我們都認為是吃麵包吃飽的🥲

❌重點有一個大地雷!!晚上約莫9點時，餐廳裡飄出滿滿的沼氣....向餐廳反應，說這問題也困擾它們很久，只要晚上十點要大量清洗鍋碗瓢盆的時候就會飄出來...我覺得也是四星級酒店，在這種地方聞到濃厚的味道真的是非常扣分的事，雖然是當初建造不佳產生的問題，但真的無法接受，尤其又在餐廳。還好我們一行人已經吃完主餐與威靈頓牛排，若此味道在上主菜時飄出來，那誰吃得下去...

⭐️鮪魚塔塔:鮪魚是生食，鮪魚應該是新鮮的。（不敢吃可以換其他熟食）

⭐️手工義大利北海道干貝餃:干貝外面包覆像是水餃皮的麵皮，滿特別的一道菜。

⭐️法式蔬菜雞湯:普普，而且可能熬煮時加了不少不同種的蔬菜，湯的尾韻喝起來酸酸的，不過詢問服務生，廚師說是正常的，但我是喝不太習慣，總覺得介於沒壞或壞掉的口感。

⭐️M5和牛:兩塊牛肉，一塊牛肉比較好吃，大概5分熟吧，另一塊像7分熟，個人覺得只有5分熟的好吃。

⭐️烏賊燉飯:這道敗筆在滿滿的紫蘇味吧，紫蘇味過重，失去原本應有的味道。

⭐️威靈頓牛排:這間店的招牌!真的是這間店的靈魂~吃完覺得「上面的都可以不用吃，吃這道就好。」

⭐️烤布蕾:就是烤布蕾，綿密啦~","4/6 pm enter the venue at 6:30 in the evening
Wellington steak needs to be booked in advance
The summary is that you can eat Welington steak.

On the same day, I ordered the package 1,600 yuan+the enjoyment of Wellington steak. There will be bread to enjoy unlimited, but the meal is too slow, which causes to eat bread when I have nothing to do. It took 2 and a half hours to the front half an hour.After eating, we all think it is a full of bread.

地 There is a big mine !! At about 9 o'clock in the evening, the biogas was full of biogas ... reacting to the restaurant, saying that this problem also bothered them for a long time. It will come out at this time ... I think it is also a four -star hotel. It is really a lot of points to smell the strong taste in this kind of place. Although it was a problem that was not built, it was really unacceptable. Especially in the restaurant.Fortunately, our party has finished eating the main meal and Verity steak. If this taste comes out of the main cuisine, who can eat ...

塔 ️ The catfish tower: catfish is eaten raw, and catfish should be fresh.(If you dare not eat, you can change to other cooked foods)

利️ Handmade Hokkaido scallop dumplings: Dry scallops are covered with dumplings, a special dish.

️ French vegetable chicken soup: Pup, and may be added with a lot of different kinds of vegetables when cooking. Always feel that there is no bad or broken taste.

两 ️M5 and beef: Two pieces of beef, one piece of beef is delicious, about 5 cooked, and the other is like 7 points. Personally, I think it is only 5 points cooked delicious.

饭️ Squid stew rice: This loser is full of perilla flavor. The perilla flavor is too heavy and loses the taste that it should have.

排 ️ Wellington Steak: The signboard of this shop! It is really the soul of this shop ~ After eating, I feel that ""there is no need to eat above, just eat this.""

就️ Baked cloth: It is bakery, dense ~"

"平日偶路過英迪格酒店，其建築的外觀總是吸引我多看一眼，利用假日與家人一大早相約來此用餐，到4樓用餐區，明亮的視野與美食，頓時喚醒了我的食慾，內部用各種型式的桌椅擺設，讓各區塊有不同意境氛圍，疏敞的空間配置，讓肢體有更大尺度的活動空間，宛如進入咖啡廳，而不是餐廳。
想想之前去的Buffer餐廳，同一型式的桌椅，格式化的排列，極小的間距，最大的容客量，人數一多，便形成搶食的景像，身在其中，已忘了我是誰，囫圇吞下又去取食，深怕落人於後，雖是美食，卻又無感，像似“填食”。
在此因座位有限，所以人也不多，可以舒緩選餐，慢食深嚐，偶以抬頭觀看戶外天空，因為悠閒、輕鬆，所以吃得滿足又不過量，雖是吃，但更多是「品」。","Passing through the Wingde Hotel on weekdays, the appearance of its building always attracts me to take a look. Use holidays to meet with my family early in the morning to dine. On the 4th floor, the bright field of vision and food instantly awakened my appetite. Use various types of tables and chairs internally to allow each block to have an uncompromising atmosphere and a spacious space configuration, so that the limbs have larger activity space, like entering the cafe instead of a restaurant.
Think about the buffer restaurant you went to, the same type of tables and chairs, formatted arrangement, a small distance, the largest number of passengers, and the number of people, which form a snatching scene. Who am I, I swallowed it and eat again. I was afraid that when I was in the food, although it was a food, I felt like ""eating"".
Because of the limited seats, there are not many people. They can soothe the meal, taste slowly, and occasionally watch the outdoor sky with their heads. Because they are leisurely and relaxed, they are satisfied with them. ""Taste""."

🌟T.R凱薩沙拉
我更喜歡木碗呈現的風格，雞肉片狀口感佳 沙拉內容豐富 味道卻很清爽 不錯

🌟慢燉牛舌
這是當日端上桌看起來擺盤最用心的料理，香草的綠對比牛舌的艷，底部的瓜中和油脂的膩，塔塔醬想起熟悉的麥香魚，搭配一些盤飾的醬汁又多了份辣覺，層次鮮明

🌟烤美國頂級牛小排
去骨處理的很徹底，方便食用，但口感非常軟嫩帶脂肪，調味偏鹹，有大口吃肉的快感

🌟巴斯克乳酪蛋糕
這道甜點是跟我印象中相差最遠的，一般熟悉的巴斯克就是因為焦糖色的外觀可以散發濃濃的香氣，質地口感且鬆軟，濃郁的味道還包含乳酪本體的呈現，在這款甜點上，沒有我理想中的感覺。但這個鳳梨乾卻搭配的非常巧妙，很輕薄、很酸甜、很迷人。

The boring treatment is very thorough, easy to eat, but the taste is very soft and fat, the seasoning is salty, and there is a pleasure of eating meat.

Basque cheese cake
This dessert is the farthest from the impression of my impression. Generally, the familiar Basque is because the appearance of the caramel can emit a strong aroma, the texture and softness, and the rich taste also contains the presence of cheese body. In this dessert, in this dessert On, there is no ideal feeling of me.But this pineapple is very clever, very thin, sweet, and charming.

"先預訂了威靈頓牛排，並且現場單點爆米花濃湯&南瓜濃湯、烤章魚腳、四起司 Pizza, （上餐順序：湯類、前菜烤章魚腳、威靈頓牛排、Pizza、威靈頓牛排的烤時蔬&馬鈴薯泥）

章魚腳烤的剛好有嚼勁，爆米花濃湯鹹甜搭配有驚艷！南瓜濃湯喝起來是安全的口味（不一定要點），但裡面的起司餃子很喜歡！pizza 是現場製作，一定要趁熱吃才能感受起司的濃郁，放久了就會有點可惜少了熱呼呼起司的濃稠感。

第一次吃威靈頓牛排，牛排本身偏柔軟，是純粹的肉質口味，沒有太多花俏的調味，外層酥皮底香脆好吃，有肉汁+奶油香融合在酥皮中。可惜這次吃得太飽了，無法試看看甜點！改天要來試看看甜點及調酒！

服務生補氣泡水也補得很勤勞，並且細心處理結帳！四個人吃平均下來一人 1666 上下，看來是單點比套餐划算。（可以吃到自己想要的菜）

PS: 桌子有點不平是稍嫌不足的地方，其他環境、廁所設計都有達到水準。","先预订了威灵顿牛排，并且现场单点爆米花浓汤&南瓜浓汤、烤章鱼脚、四起司Pizza, （上餐顺序：汤类、前菜烤章鱼脚、威灵顿牛排、Pizza、威Renon steak grilled vegetable & potato puree)

The octopus feet are just chewy, and the popcorn thick soup is salty and sweet!Pumpkin soup is a safe taste (not necessarily point), but the cheese dumplings inside like it very much!Pizza is made on the spot. Be sure to eat it while it is hot to feel the richness of the cheese. It will be a pity that it will be a bit less dense.

For the first time, I ate the Verxon steak. The steak itself was soft and pure. It was pure fleshy flavor. There were not many fancy seasonings. The outer plasmis was crispy and delicious.Unfortunately, I was too full this time, and I couldn't try to see the desserts!Try to see desserts and bartending!

The waiter replenishes the gas and water is also very hardworking, and carefully handle the checkout!Four people eat an average of one person 1666, it seems that it is cost -effective to compare the package.(You can eat the dishes you want)

PS: The table is a bit uneven place, and other environments and toilet design have reached the level."
"大直的複合式餐飲概念！
結合食材選品、餐酒以及飯店的新型態商場。
試了經典套餐，包涵沙拉、湯品、前菜、主菜及甜點。
沙拉表現很好👍 食材感覺有跟著時令走，也不是基本款的凱薩沙拉，剛好的調味！
前菜是燉鮑魚，鮑魚新鮮有彈性不軔口，吃得出原本活跳跳感😍
主菜菲力火侯跟厚薄度很棒，搭炸過的大蒜很稱職😌
無骨雞翅松露燉飯，可能因爲湯品已經是松露濃湯，味覺上重覆感太強，如果單點絕對是很出色的主餐，不過吃久了有一點點膩口。
甜點是特色口味巴斯克蛋糕佐鳳梨乾，老實說我吃完完全猜不到是什麼口味🥹（抱歉我太俗氣了）鹹甜口味很特殊。
整棟大樓幾乎都是星級餐廳，裝潢新潮、概念也很完整，預定的話應該可以選到觀景的位置（雖然高度是二樓）","The concept of Dazhi composite catering!
Combined with ingredients, meals and new types of hotels.
Try the classic package, including salad, soup, front dishes, main dishes and desserts.
Salad's performance is very good. The ingredients feel that you follow the season, nor are the basic Caesar salad, just season!
The previous dish is stewed abalone, and the abalone is fresh and elastic, and the original jump can be eaten.
The main cuisine Feili Huohou and the thickness are great, the fried garlic is very competent 😌
Boneless chicken wing truffle stew, maybe because the soup is already a truffle thick soup, the taste is too strong. If the single point is definitely a very good main meal, it is a little greasy after eating.
Dessert is the special taste Bask cake. The pineapple is dried. To be honest, I can’t guess what the taste is.
The entire building is almost all star restaurants, with trendy decoration and complete concept. If you are booked, you should choose the location of the viewing (although the height is the second floor)"
"餐點表現不錯
服務質量待提升
但依舊感謝過年期間有餐廳能吃
有人員為我們服務🙏

當天點餐，已經先預訂威靈頓牛排
知道份量很大所以並沒有加點太多餐點

由於對餐點的不熟悉
意外的點了兩道湯
但服務人員過程中並沒有告知
有點意外這樣價位的餐廳沒有提醒客人
所以上菜時有點嚇到

正餐前附贈的麵包並不是溫熱的
奶油提供的也是包裝奶油
感覺略為隨便

主餐威靈頓酥皮部分烤的很好
由於是第一次嘗試
不曉得牛排部分幾乎是非常生的狀態
是否正常？
可能因為是菲力，口感偏軟嫩
少了油花與咬勁
口感上略顯單調與生食感

附贈的配菜倒是都很鮮甜很不錯

但威靈頓真的很大份
建議四個人共享比較剛好

整體而言美中不足略顯失望😅","The meals are good
Service quality is to be improved
But I still thanks for a restaurant to eat during the Chinese New Year
Someone serves us 服务

Ordering that day, I have already reservations for Wellington steaks first
I know that the portion is very large, so I don’t add too much meal

Because they are not familiar with meals
I accidentally ordered two soups
But in the process of service personnel, I did not inform
A bit unexpectedly a restaurant at this price does not remind guests
So it was a bit scared when she was serving

The bread accompanied by the dinner is not warm
Cream also provides packaging cream
It feels slightly casual

The main meal is a well -baked meal meringue
Because it is the first time
I don’t know that the steak part is almost very rare
Is it normal?
Maybe because it is Fili, the taste is soft and tender
Lares on oil flowers and bite
The taste is slightly monotonous and the sense of raw food

The accompanying side dishes are all fresh and sweet

But Wellington is really big
It is recommended that four people sharing is just right

On the whole, the shortcomings of the United States are slightly disappointed 😅"
"威靈頓牛排超級無敵驚豔！師傅會直接現切，聽著卡滋卡滋的聲音特別舒暢
伊比利豬居然可以弄得跟牛排一樣軟嫩！
松露燉飯和濃湯真的很好吃，濃湯配麵包更是絕配
牛舌我也吃過不少，這麼厚又鮮嫩多汁的真的少見！
直接跟朋友約下次來的時間了！","Wellington steak is super invincible!The master will cut it directly, listening to the sound of Kazakz is particularly comfortable
The Iberbone pig can be as soft and tender as steak!
Tulu stewed rice and soup are really delicious, and the soup with bread is even more perfect
I have eaten a lot of beef tongue, so thick, fresh and juicy!
I will make an appointment with my friends next time!"
他們家最有名的威靈頓牛排需要提前一兩天預約喔， 本人不是威靈頓牛排粉絲不愛麵包， 但是他們家的很好吃喔。 一份約16oz 4個人吃差不多， 牛排與麵包中間有一層松露調味。 另外點了雞翅燉飯risotto也是滿滿的松露，感覺太多松露東西了 。烤烏賊肉質綿密味道很好個人比較偏愛吃很Q的， House wine是偏酸的， 可以試喝再決定要不要，餐廳本身很漂亮還有一個戶外區， 晚上在外面聊聊天喝酒很舒服。一人大消費大概1500~2000。,"The most famous Wellington steak in their family needs to make an appointment one or two days in advance. I am not a Wiredon steak fan who does not like bread, but their family is delicious.A copy of 16oz 4 people eat the same, and there is a layer of truffle in the middle of the steak.In addition, the chicken wings stewed rice Risotto is also full of truffles, and it feels too much truffle.The dense taste of roasted squid is very good. Individuals are more preferred to eat Q. House Wine is sour. You can try to drink and decide whether you want it. The restaurant itself is very beautiful and there is an outdoor area. It is very comfortable to chat and drink outside at night.The consumption of one person is about 1500 ~ 2000."
"已經不用調光看起來就肚子很餓了
原來這才是 #威靈頓牛排 我之前吃了什麼東西？！
可頌肉片嗎 😂😂
#大直英迪格 的#trbarandkitchen 真的有厲害
每一道都可以細細品味無窮回味
點了這麼多道完全沒有地雷
只有酒有點雷因為一杯$400但是只倒了大約100-200cc吧 而且只是點香檳喲成本是有多高 哈哈
這裡現在要和N168同樣併在第一名了！

打包的時候服務人員稱讚我們很會吃
說一般兩個人點一份16oz 威靈頓+一盤沙拉就吃不下了
瞬間覺得很驕傲 哈哈
我胖我驕傲！

用餐環境舒適是我很重視的
如果是高價位的話啦
像這種在飯店裡有餐廳自己的廁所
桌句寬廣
還有可以吃太飽走走拍照的大露台
最喜歡了～💕

威靈頓牛排很軟嫩，吃起來有種燉煮的感覺，外層酥皮又香又酥脆。爆米花濃湯很有玉米的甜味，加入爆米花讓香氣更濃郁，裡面還有煙燻鴨肉很特別。餐廳氣氛很好，裝潢很時髦，餐具也都很有質感，中午用餐靠著落地窗採光很好，是很棒的用餐體驗。,"Wellington steak is very soft and tender, and it feels like stewing, and the outer plasmis is fragrant and crispy.The popcorn soup has the sweetness of corn. Add popcorn to make the aroma stronger, and there are smoky duck meat.The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good, the decoration is very fashionable, and the tableware is also very textured. The lighting of the floor -to -ceiling window is very good at lunch. It is a great dining experience."
"餐廳環境好 氣氛佳 服務人員態度都非常好 我們點了白酒蛤蜊義大利麵 威靈頓牛排 兩杯果汁 義大利麵的麵偏硬 蛤蜊比較鹹一些 不過整體十分入味 算是蠻好吃的 威靈頓牛排可能是我個人不懂西餐 外表酥皮不是想像中的酥脆口感 而且因主廚專業的堅持所以牛排上桌是偏溫 然後我們因為只有兩人 吃一份牛排非常吃力 建議還是3~4人點一份會比較剛好
僅僅是訂餐時在用餐原因勾選慶生 餐廳就在最後自動送上小蛋糕 是十分貼心的舉動 光是這點就讓人用餐十分愉快","The good atmosphere of the restaurant environment is very good. The attitude of the service staff is very good. We ordered the white wine clam and the Italinon noodles. Two cups of fruit juice. It may be that I personally don’t understand that the appearance of the western meal is not the crispy taste in imagination. Because of the insistence of the chef's professional, the steak is on the table to be warm and then because there are only two people eating a steak. The portion will be just right
Just checking the birthday restaurant at the end of the meal when ordering meals is very intimate at the end."
"今天有預約了威靈頓牛排

並點了沙拉、南瓜濃湯、瑪格麗特pizza及甜點

南瓜濃湯裡有放義大利餃子

然後不知道是不是有特殊調味有一種偏酸的感覺很微妙

沙拉pizza甜點都不錯吃！

威靈頓牛排沒讓人失望

牛肉肉質很好👍

讓人回家也想努力做看看哈哈哈","Today, I made an appointment for Wellington steak

And ordered salad, pumpkin soup, Margaret Pizza and desserts

There are Pumpkin soup with Italian dumplings

Then I don’t know if there is a special seasoning and a kind of acidity, it feels delicate

Salad pizza desserts are good!

Wellington steak is not disappointed

Beef meat is very good 质

I want to go home and want to do it to see hahaha"
"威靈頓牛排🥩 16oz
適合四個人吃哦～～需提前預訂～～
這道菜給滿分💯

其他的就....一般般啦～
服務很好，價格人均1500up","Wellington steak o 16oz
Suitable for four people to eat ~~ You need to book in advance ~~
This dish is given full score 满

Others ....
The service is very good, the price per capita is 1500up"
說真的不是很好吃，肉質ok，但醬汁沒味道，松露蘑菇醬應該沒調味，可能給些海鹽比較好，然後我訂位付威靈頓款項時，也說要預定龍蝦，結果到現場跟我說沒貨，真的不知道該說什麼,"Seriously, it is not delicious. The meat is OK, but the sauce is not flavorful. The truffle mushroom sauce should not be seasoned. It may be better to give some sea salt. Then when I booked the money, I also said that I would book lobster. I said to me on the spot, I really don't know what to say"
"本次採套餐制，如果選牛的話$1800、豬$1600，並加收10%服務費，將近兩千塊的餐點，男性吃不飽就算了，連我小鳥胃都餓到沒辦法，只能靠可以續加的麵包來擋，鹹食的口味水準有，但分量都小到誇張，照片我已經靠很近拍了，大家可以參考。
（相同等級的餐廳菜色也不會這樣，真心無法理解）

飯後咖啡跟茶飲如果份量沒有很多，就不要拿大的馬克杯裝嘛，一上桌只有三分之一看了完全沒美感，喝咖啡的朋友杯緣還有滲漏的咖啡漬，管理階層感覺沒有細心在顧呢。

服務部分，服務生人數眾多，基本上要什麼都會蠻快速的拿給你，但是如果你坐在沙發側，手不夠長的時候，就直接幫你放中間（沒有放到個人餐巾紙上），只給你一個眼神就跑掉了，所以是？ 可以好好說明要我們幫忙拿都沒問題啊...不要丟在半路嘛，小細節可能要再注意。

一顆星給裝潢，一顆星給天台美景，
可能單點制會比較好一點吧？給大家參考參考。","This time, if you choose a cattle, if you choose a cattle $ 1800, a pig $ 1600, and charge a 10%service fee, nearly 2,000 yuan meals, it ’s okay for men to eat. It can be blocked by bread that can be renewed. The taste level of salty food is as small as exaggerated. I have taken the photo very close to the photos. You can refer to it.
(The restaurant of the same level will not be the case, I really can't understand it)

If there is not much portion of coffee and tea after a meal, do n’t get a large Mark Cup. Only one -third of the table is completely incompetent. Friends who drink coffee cup and leaky coffee stains. Management. Management. Management. Management. The class does not feel attentive.

In the service part, there are a large number of waiters. Basically, everything will be given to you quickly, but if you are sitting on the sofa side and your hands are not long, you can directly put you in the middle (not put on a personal napkin), only Give you a look and run away, so is it?It can be explained that it is no problem to help us get it ... Don't throw it in halfway. You may have to pay attention to the small details.

A decoration of a piece, a star to the rooftop beauty,
Maybe a single point system will be better?For your reference."
"威靈頓牛排的酥皮非常好吃，由主廚親自服務，三重起司披薩味道更是驚人，完全不會膩，單點甜味很適合小朋友食用，燉飯跟義大利麵也非常美味，米粒硬度剛好，開的白酒跟紅酒也都很順，甜點是特製的芒果慕思，爽口不膩，服務也很親切，雖然價格較高但蠻值得體驗的
Delicious food, fancy decorations, comfortable dining environment, the Beef Wellington is extremely delicious.","The meringue of Wellington steak is very delicious and served by the chef himself. The triple cheese pizza is even more amazing. It will not be greasy at all. The sweetness is suitable for children. The hardness of rice grains is just right, and the white wine and red wine are also very smooth. The dessert is a special mango Musi, which is refreshing and not greasy, and the service is very kind. Although the price is high, it is quite worthwhile.
Delicious Food, Fancy Decorations, Comfortable Dining Environment, The Beef Wellington is Extremelyly Delicious."
"標榜聘請米其林星級主廚的餐廳
卻一點也沒有體會到星級該有的餐點和服務！
一點都沒有！

我和女友是英迪格Indigo 飯店的住戶。
入住當晚包含一份 T.R Bar & Kitchen 餐廳晚膳
當晚到了指定用餐時間。
我們至二樓用餐check in
門口服務員表示沒有收到飯店櫃檯通知保留我們的座位
我們詢問原因為什麼會這樣
服務員表示說因為他們的電腦和飯店櫃檯沒有連線同步。
原來一間大飯店中的二樓米其林星級餐廳是消費者購買一泊二食之後，剩下的餐廳預約要消費者自己來訂位，我學到一課了。
最後我們請服務員打給一樓櫃檯詢問
詢問之後服務員才安排我們入座.....

非常好
還幫我們安排在一張會搖晃的餐桌用餐。

第一道菜 - 鮪魚塔塔
完全吃不出魚鮮香味和酪梨味，沾醬調味掩蓋整體，吃完很空虛。

第二道菜 - 手工義大利北海道干貝餃
干貝餃沒有干貝的香味，麵粉皮的味道搶走內餡鮮肉味。菇類和紅蘿蔔讓整體菜味很重，整碗湯喝起來不鹹也不香，像是清水煮菜一般。

第四道菜 - 香烤澳洲A5和牛
（女友的這道菜換成香煎松阪豬）
A5和牛吃起來毫無油香味，連最起碼的A3等級都應該要有油香味，但這邊的A5和牛完全沒有！搭配的蘆筍像是冷凍太久了，吃起來毫無水份！玉米筍也沒有！

女友點的松阪豬還送錯了！送過來的是A5和牛。經過我們告知送錯，服務員立刻端走，等待20分鐘給我們正確的松阪豬，我們品嚐後，豬肉吃起來不嫩，不香，稍微乾柴，應該是為了要趕快出餐給我們導致的。

第五道菜 - 烏賊珍珠麵
最失望的一道菜，整體完全沒有海鮮該有的鮮香味，口感沒有咬勁，吃不出是烏賊。醬汁完全不搭。

服務過程：
我們入座後，服務員在我們面前擦拭餐具，一件一件擦拭乾淨再幫我們擺在桌面上....正常不是應該要先準備好後再帶我們入座嗎？
更何況這裡還是號稱有米其林名廚的餐廳...
桌面上每個人的面前備用餐具，中間備有ㄧ盤子。
第一道菜「鮪魚塔塔」上來時，服務員直接把菜放在餐桌正中間，說明了菜名後就離去，我和女友疑惑的看著服務員離開，為什麼服務員不會幫我們把我們各自面前的空盤移開，再把「鮪魚塔塔」放到我們面前。
好吧，也許服務員是新來的，要我們自己移動料理到我們面前。
第二道菜、第三道、之後的每一道都是如此！每一道菜都是要我們把自己的料理移到我們面前！連主餐都是如此！完全不用服務員幫忙！
原來星級的餐廳教育訓練如此讓我大開眼界！

一頓美好的晚餐從一開始的登記得到傻眼的回覆，到帶位後的服務舉動，接著享用餐餚。整體下來沒有一次令人滿意的。

抱歉我說錯了，唯一一件讓人滿意的是途中女服務員會時常幫我們加水，其餘的男服務員從頭到尾讓人失望。

我們從一開始得知沒有為我們安排座位到最後，沒有一句催促過服務員，甚至兇過服務員，但我們卻被如此對待。好吧，這就是所謂的米其林名廚餐廳下的料理和服務，我們無法承受也不願再次光顧，留給其他消費者顧客去體會吧。

當下甜點不吃，我們直接走人。

以上句句屬實，並未增加或修改內容。","Mark the restaurant for hiring Michelin star chefs
But I didn't realize the meals and services that the star should have!
Nothing at all!

My girlfriend and I are the residents of the INDIGO Hotel.
Including a T.R Bar & Kitchen restaurant on the night of staying
It was the designated meal that night.
We will eat on the second floor. Check in
The waiter at the door stated that he did not receive the hotel counter notification to keep our seat
We asked why the reason would be like this
The waiter said that there was no connection synchronization because their computers and restaurants counters were not connected.
It turned out that the Michelin star restaurant on the second floor in a large restaurant was that after the consumer purchased one or two foods, the rest of the restaurant appointment to make a book to book a place. I learned a lesson.
Finally, we asked the waiter to call the first floor counter to inquire
The waiter arranged for us to take a seat after asking ...

very good
Also help us arrange to dine at a dining table that can shake.

The first dish -the catfish tower
Can't eat the fresh flavor and avocado flavor at all.

Second dish -Handmade Hokkaido scallop dumplings
Dry scallop dumplings have no fragrance of scallops, and the smell of flour peel snatched the flavor of the stuffing fresh meat.Mushrooms and carrots make the overall dishes very heavy.

The fourth dish -Xiang Baked Australia A5 and Cow
(This girlfriend's dish is replaced with Nor fried Matsusaka pig)
A5 and Niu have no oily fragrance. Even the minimum A3 level should have oil flavor, but there is no A5 and beef here!The asparagus with asparagus seems to be frozen for too long, and it has no water!There are no corn bamboo shoots!

My girlfriend's Matsusaka pig was also wrong!The A5 and cows were sent.After we informed the wrong, the waiter immediately left and waited for 20 minutes to give us the correct Matsusaka pig. After we tasted it, the pork was not tender, not fragrant, and a little dry wood. It should be caused to cause us to give us a meal.

Fifth dish -Squid Pearl Noodles
The most disappointed dish, there is no fresh fragrance of seafood as a whole, the taste is not bitter, and it is not a squid.The sauce does not match at all.

Service process:
After we took the seat, the waiter wiped the tableware in front of us, wiped it out one by one, and then helped us put on the table ... Do n’t you have to prepare before you should take us into the seat first?
Not to mention the restaurant of Michelin's chef here ...
Everyone on the desktop is a spare tableware in front of each person, with a plate in the middle.
When the first dish ""The Catfish Tower"" came up, the waiter put the dishes directly in the middle of the table, showing that the dish name left after the name of the dish. My girlfriend and I watched the waiter away. The empty tray in front of each other moved away, and then put the ""Curma Tower"" in front of us.
Well, maybe the waiter is new, and we have to move our own dishes to us.
This is the second dish, the third, and after each one!Every dish is to move our dishes to us!Even the main meal is like this!No waiter to help at all!
It turns out that star -level restaurant education and training makes me eye -catching!

A beautiful dinner received a dumbfound reply from the beginning, to the service movement after the position, and then enjoy the meals.There is no satisfactory one as a whole.

Sorry, I was wrong. The only thing I was satisfied was that the female waiters on the way would often help us add water, and the rest of the male waiters were disappointing from beginning to end.

From the beginning, we learned that we did not arrange a seat for us to the end, and none of them urged the waiter or even fiercely the waiter, but we were treated like this.Well, this is the so -called cooking and services under the Michelin famous kitchen restaurant. We cannot afford or patronize again, and leave it to other consumer customers to experience it.

If you do n’t eat the desserts now, we will leave directly.

The above sentences are true and have not increased or modified content."
餐廳空間好，氣氛佳。餐點份量很足夠，但美味程度不一。服務不錯，可惜最後要結帳的時間都跑光了,"The restaurant space is good and the atmosphere is good.The meal is sufficient, but the degree of deliciousness is different.The service is good, but unfortunate"
在T.R度過了愉快的母親節，餐點和氣氛都很到位。波士頓龍蝦很好吃，服務員推薦的調酒濃度不會太重，適合平常不喝酒的女生～,"On T.R, I spent a pleasant Mother's Day, and the meals and atmosphere were in place.Boston lobster is delicious, the concentration of bartender recommended by the waiter will not be too heavy, suitable for girls who do not drink alcohol ~"
"年輕活潑的飯店全天候餐廳，但目前午間沒有供應下午茶，只有供應甜點和飲料。甜點水準很高！
服務人員皆美麗大方又親切，很舒服的地方！","Young and lively restaurants are all -weather restaurants, but no afternoon tea is currently available at noon, only desserts and drinks are available.The level of desserts is high!
The service staff are beautiful, generous and kind, very comfortable!"
"環境寬敞優雅，但服務生服務仍待加強，明明訂位沒人等卻讓客人空等10分鐘（雖然我們一邊聊天靜待）；點熱咖啡來冰咖啡，後來換了但說了2次給我一小杯鮮奶自己加卻還是忘了！
今天沒有別的僅供應午間套餐，一人2張小朋友，吃得挺飽，但味道普普，總之吃完沒一道菜有印象，服務還不如一般簡餐店親切貼心。
生菜新鮮但調味有些單調；蔬菜湯有著藥膳的清香，味道清雅，喝完沒什麼驚艷；鱸魚烤的有點柴；薑黃燉飯還可以；草莓雪絡甜點，只能說我偏愛巧克力&檸檬不懂欣賞，對了，餐後熱咖啡堪比吃到飽餐廳的全自動機器義式咖啡。
結論：天啊我今天到底吃了什麼？！
OS：我其實不常吃大餐，但品嚐好食物的舌頭還是有的，這價錢我寧可拿去吃居酒屋燒烤店或是有點特色的簡餐店（大直比比皆是）！","The environment is spacious and elegant, but the waiter's service is still to be strengthened. No one waits for the booking to wait for the guests to wait for 10 minutes (although we are chatting while chatting); I have forgotten a small cup of fresh milk by myself!
Today, there is no other supply for noon package. Two children in one person are full, but the taste is Popp. In short, there is no impression after eating a dish. The service is not as intimate as the average minimalist restaurant.
The lettuce is fresh but seasoned; the vegetable soup has the fragrance of medicated diet, the taste is elegant, and there is no stunning after drinking; the sea bass is a bit of firewood; the stewed rice is ok; the strawberry snowweed dessert, I can only say that I prefer chocolate & lemon By the way, hot coffee after meals is comparable to full -automatic machine -style coffee that eats a full restaurant.
Conclusion: Oh my god, what did I eat today?Intersection
OS: I do n’t actually eat big meals, but there are still some tongues that taste the food. I would rather take the izakaya barbecue restaurant or a bit of a simple dining restaurant (Dazhi is abound)!"
肉食主義Pizza、雞肉燉飯、前菜小卷、醃紅紺都很好吃，甜點愛吃巧克力的人應該很愛😊環境、服務都令人感到舒服、放鬆！可惜炸田雞腿賣完，沒吃到😂😂😂下次想再去一次，然後想試試威靈頓牛排🥩 …,"Carnivorous Pizza, chicken stewed rice, small rolls of previous vegetables, and pickled red crickets are delicious. Desserts who love chocolate should love the environment and services that are comfortable and relaxed!Unfortunately, the fried field chicken legs are sold."
"TR凱撒沙拉：很普通

"環境設計美觀大方，員工服務良好，可以事先協調餐點先烹飪，一入座就可以上菜不用等。這次單點一份威靈頓牛排，想說餐廳直接把這道菜貼在大門口當廣告，一定是很有信心。
威靈頓牛排本是四人套餐中的一道菜，單點的話兩個人吃剛剛好，有附一盤烤蔬菜、一份麵包(可續)和薯泥，這些配餐口味普通，但威靈頓牛排本身相當好吃，牛肉肉質鮮嫩多汁，酥皮內層塗滿松露和蘑菇，口味很搭，和牛排一起入口非常享受。一份威靈頓牛排會切成四份，前後的純酥皮也會切成四塊，一人各吃兩塊，份量很足。
唯一可惜的是價位偏高，單點威靈頓牛排加上服務費就要4.2K，其他義大利麵、比薩單點也都要500以上，較不親民。","The environmental design is beautiful and generous, and the employee service is good. You can coordinate the meal in advance to cook first.This time, a single -order Verdon steak, wanting to say that the restaurant directly posted this dish at the gate as an advertisement, it must be very confident.
Wellington steak is a dish in the four -person set meal. For a single point, the two people just eat it. There is a plate of grilled vegetables, a piece of bread (can be continued) and the potato puree. The steak itself is quite delicious. The beef is fresh and juicy, and the inner layer of the plasma is covered with truffle and mushrooms. The taste is very good. It is very enjoyable with the steak.One of the Verxon steaks will be cut into four copies, and the pure meringue can also be cut into four pieces. One person eats two pieces each, and the portion is sufficient.
The only pity is that the price is high. The single -point Wellington steak plus the service fee is 4.2K. Other pasta and pizza are also more than 500, which is less close to the people."
"在IG上看到了這餐廳，看來不錯，便來試試看！
整體來說，食材都還不錯，牛肉烤的也很香、好吃！
服務人員很親切，點了一份套餐，外加Pizza及烤40oz的牛排🥩。不錯吃的👍 …","I saw this restaurant on IG, and it seemed good, so come and try it!
Overall, the ingredients are not bad, and the beef roast is also very fragrant and delicious!
The service staff was very kind, ordered a package, plus Pizza and baking 40oz steak.Good 👍 👍 ..."
有時候還是不要抱太高的期待，失望才不會這麼大，憑良心講這威靈頓牛排真的不怎麼樣，看著長期追的美食部落客對他有如此高的評價，實際去吃卻不是如此，很令人失望啊！而且不是切片，是切成照片中的塊狀，影響美觀，不過其他義大利蘑菇餃、龍蝦細扁麵是還不錯，但最好吃的是炸雞翅！因為是現炸的，整體餐點選擇也不多，然後服務普通，另外有點了一瓶紅酒，紅酒裡有非常多的沈澱物，不知道是放太久還是怎麼樣，有先google查詢不是壞掉或什麼的，所以就沒有特別反應，不過經過這次的經驗，下次不會再回訪了。,"Sometimes don't expect too high expectations, disappointment will not be so great. It is really not good to talk about this Wei Linton steak with conscience. Looking at the long -term chasing gourmet bloggers have such a high evaluation of him. It's not so disappointing!And it is not a slice, it is cut into a block in the photo, which affects the beauty, but other Italian mushroom dumplings and lobster fine flat noodles are pretty good, but the best food is fried chicken wings!Because it is fried, there are not many choices for the overall meal, and then the service is ordinary. In addition, there is a bottle of red wine. There are a lot of sedents in the wine. I don’t know if it is too long or what. There is no special response, but after this experience, I will not return to visit next time."
"很難得也很久沒有吃到這麼好吃的美食料理
令人驚喜的商業午餐
牛舌入口及融
切工非常漂亮
咖啡很好喝
餅乾，龍眼麵包也非常好吃

下次要來試pizza 和其他的美食","It's rare and I haven't eaten such delicious food for a long time
Surprising commercial lunch
Beef tongue entrance and melting
Cut it very beautifully
Coffee is delicious
Biscuits, longan bread is also very delicious

Next time I will try pizza and other foods"
威靈頓牛排很好吃，皮不會軟掉還保有酥脆口感，裡面的肉很軟嫩多汁，當日是選套餐，每道菜都很有特色，服務員也會細問有沒有不吃的東西能為客人調整菜色。,"Wellington steak is delicious, the skin will not be softened, and the crispy taste will be kept. The meat inside is very soft and juicy. On the same day, it is selected. Each dish is very distinctive. Things can adjust the dishes for guests."
"預定點了威靈頓牛排, 還另外加點了其他前菜、沙拉、湯品, 上菜的時候一次全上, 完全沒有在管什麼順序的, 什麼叫 Starter? 根本他們不關心。威靈頓牛排第一道上, 湯擺在了最後, 徹底顛覆了我對於高級餐廳牛排的想像, 旁邊的 Prime 168 跟教父也不是沒吃過, 如果覺得這個價位是可以得到不錯的服務跟用餐體驗, 那你可能就錯了。消費差不多的價位你可以走到旁邊的維多莉亞, 會覺得更值得。餐費事小, 傷的是你帶家人來過紀念日卻還得吃得匆匆忙忙像難民似的。

不過用餐口味公正地說是還算可以, 但是這樣的用餐體驗跟服務, 真心推薦旁邊的維多莉亞不會讓你生氣, 真的把這間店當個 Bar 去就還算可以, 千萬不要當作高級餐廳期望太高。","After ordering the Verxon steak, I also added other previous dishes, salads, and soups. When they were served, they were all in the order. They did not care about the order at all. What is Starter? They don't care about it at all.On the first road of Wellington steak, the soup was at the end, completely subverting my imagination of high -end restaurant steaks. The Prime 168 next to the godfather did not have eaten with the godfather. Experience, then you may be wrong.You can go to the next Victoria next to the price of consumption, and you will feel more worthy.The meal cost is small. What hurts you to bring your family to the anniversary, but you still have to eat in a hurry like refugees.

However, it is okay to say fairly, but this dining experience and service, I really recommend Victoria next to it, it will not make you angry. It is okay to take this shop as a bar. As a high -end restaurant, it is expected to be too high."
"這次使用一泊二食方案，服務員告知晚餐是1600元的套餐，水資另計。
1） 餐點味道還不錯，這是唯一的優點。
2） 窗邊整排兩人座位根本不應該安排給客人，因為椅子的高度相對於桌面太高了，用餐很不舒適，餐廳設計時都沒有注意桌椅搭配問題，太不可思議了。
3）開放式廚房設計很常見，但整晚都在聽服務員大聲點餐、廚師大聲回應或下指示，例如：「給我28份玉米」、「我要一份素的」、「給我推車」⋯⋯還有刺耳的碗盤敲擊聲，我還以為自己在夜市熱炒攤吃飯。
4）用餐當日有宴會，或許是這樣上菜非常不順暢，兩道菜的間隔很長，而且餐廳還有很多空位就混亂成這樣。如果餐廳人力無法同時承受宴會與一般客人，應考慮縮減宴會規模或是當日不接一般客人，讓客人乾等上菜一邊聽廚師咆哮難道是希望客人反省自己不應該點餐增加廚師負擔？？
5）廚師們常常口罩戴在下巴。

整體來說沒有星級酒店餐廳的水準。","This time, using the one -bodonal plan, the waiter informed the dinner for a package of 1,600 yuan, and the water capital was separated.
1) The taste of the meal is not bad, which is the only advantage.
2) The entire row of the two -person seats by the window should not be arranged to the guests at all, because the height of the chair is too high to the desktop, and the meal is very uncomfortable. The restaurant does not pay attention to the problem of tables and chairs during the design of the restaurant. It is incredible.
3) Open kitchen design is very common, but they are listening to waiters to order loudly all night, chef respond loudly or instructions, for example: ""Give me 28 corn"", ""I want a copy"", ""Push me for me to push me me. ""The car"" also harsh the sound of the dishes, and I thought I was eating hot stalls in the night market.
4) There is a banquet on the day of dining. Perhaps it is very unsatisfactory to the food. The two dishes are long, and there are many empty seats in the restaurant.If the restaurant's manpower cannot withstand the banquet and ordinary guests at the same time, you should consider shrinking the scale of the banquet or not receiving ordinary guests on the same day. Let the guests wait for the cooking to listen to the kitchen roaring, do you want the guest to reflect on themselves and not to order food to increase the burden on the chef?Intersection
5) Chefs often wear masks on chin.

Overall, there is no level of star hotel restaurants."
菜色很有創意味道也算中上，沾醬部分有一些些分子料理的巧思。服務人員很親切，這次吃套餐，下次還想試試看服務生推薦的Pizza^_^,"The dish is very creative and the same is considered to be medium. There are some ingenuity of molecular dishes in the dipping sauce.The service staff is very kind. This time I eat a package, and I want to try the pizza^_^recommended by the waiter next time"
分享餐的牛小排和伊比利豬都要快 3000，牛小排很軟嫩但調味太重吃不到牛肉的原味，伊比利豬真的份量超少，比牛小孩還不值，其他菜的口味也是表現普普，軟性飲料選擇很少，公司聚餐下來點分享餐一個人大概要 2000，老實說真的覺得價錢太貴C/P值很低。,"The cow small pows ​​and Iberbille pigs who share meals are 3,000 faster. Niu Xiaowei is very soft but the flavor of the beef is too heavy. The Iberbille pig really has a very small amount. The taste is also pretty Pop. There are very few soft drinks. The company's dinner will share the meal for about 2000. To be honest, it really feels that the price is too expensive. The C/P value is very low."
"整體都很好吃！

濃湯跟燉飯的松露都超級重，
巴斯克的巧克力底有點煙燻，類似桂圓？","The whole is delicious!

Soup and the truffles of stewed rice are super heavy,
Basque's chocolate base is a bit smoky, similar to longan?"
南瓜濃湯濃郁好喝，肉類料理份量很足夠，建議兩人選一種肉類一樣澱粉主食，不理解怎麼會有人評論吃不飽😅 …,"Pumpkin soup is rich and delicious, and the amount of meat dishes is sufficient. It is recommended that two people choose a starch of starch like a meat."
食物色香味俱全，開胃菜的墨魚軟嫩好吃，爆米花濃湯香濃可口，威靈頓牛排更是不可以錯過。,"The food is full of color and fragrance, and the prejuopedic cuttlefish are soft and delicious. The popcorn soup is strong and delicious. Willington steak should not be missed."
"澳洲和牛的Wellington beef 很好吃，
其他的每一道菜都有分子料理的做法，很不錯。不過因為是大年初一的套餐，價錢不便宜，但整體上來說，值得。","Australian Wellington Beef is delicious,
Every other dish has a molecular dishes, which is very good.However, because it is a package of New Year's Day, the price is not cheap, but overall, it is worth it."
"2022.10.28
入住提供的早餐，樣式算多而精緻，有現榨果汁就是讚，平日入住還會幫忙送到位置。歐姆蛋非常優秀，是吃過前幾名好吃的。","2022.10.28
The breakfast provided by staying in, has many styles and exquisite styles. There is a lot of squeezing juice.Ohm egg is very good and has eaten the first few delicious."
"餐的份量很足
也很好吃
服務和親切度需加強","The amount of meals is sufficient
It's also delicious
Service and intimacy need to be strengthened"
南法料理，我們常跟朋友一起來吃，伊比利豬很推，雞肉凱撒沙拉也很美味，緬因龍蝦義大利麵也是難忘的料理，肉食主義Pizza也別錯過，餐後建議要點甜點，因為每一種甜點都超級好吃,"Southern French cuisine, we often eat with friends, Iberbig pigs are very pushing, chicken Caesar salad is also delicious. The Maine lobster Italian noodles are also unforgettable dishes. Do n’t miss the meatist Pizza. Every kind of dessert is super delicious"
"買了二人和牛券晚上前往，意外的餐點清爽無負擔，又好吃。
而且難得的是西餐中每一道菜都有充分的蔬果。
當天安排的座位區在最裡面，一邊是公司團體十多人的聚餐，另一邊是大家族聚餐加上兩個小小孩吵得不行。雖餐點好吃但毫無氣氛就是......
另外結帳要離開時，結帳區出現一位穿著便服踩著高跟鞋的員工? 老闆娘?  拋過來的眼光很奇怪，覺得不太舒服。
其他員工都非常親切。
整體來說還是很推薦的餐廳。","I bought the two and the cow voucher at night. The unexpected meal was refreshing and no burden, and it was delicious.
And it is rare that every dish in Western food has sufficient fruits and vegetables.
The seat area arranged on the day was at the bottom, one on the one hand, a dinner for more than a dozen people in the company, and the other side was the big family dinner and two little children.Although the meal is delicious, there is no atmosphere ...
In addition, when the checkout is to leave, a employee who is wearing a casual clothes on the checkout area? The boss lady?
Other employees are very kind.
Overall is a recommended restaurant."
東西好吃 服務人員親切！餐廳氣氛也很不錯，位置寬敞不擁擠， 特別推地中海小捲和pizza！,"Good service staff is kind!The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very good, and the location is spacious and crowded. Special pushing the ground and Pizza!"
"小年夜，沒什麼客人，不吵雜，享受寬敞舒適的空間。
牛排、伊比利豬、嫩煎雞腿燉飯都合胃口。","Little, there is no guest, no noise, and enjoying spacious and comfortable space.
Steak, Ibilia pigs, and tender chicken legs stewed in the appetite."
整個環境非常舒適，服務人員非常親切，對小孩友善，點了法國烤花枝，龍蝦義大利麵和招牌無骨雞翅燉飯，都非常好吃！,"The whole environment is very comfortable, the service staff is very kind, friendly to children, ordered French roasting flower branches, lobster Italian noodles and signs without bone chicken wings, which are very delicious!"
隨著Deanston的品酒會來到英迪格酒店內的西餐廳。走進來 時尚還有特別的裝潢設計 實在令人感到興奮與期待 。果不其然，每道菜的精緻與獨特的口感 ，在在體現出廚師對食材的尊敬與熟悉。才能創造出絕佳的風味。搭配著酒。非常開心的一個晚餐 。肯定會再訪。,"As Deanston's wine tasting will come to the Western Restaurant in the Western Hotel in the Western Hotel.It is exciting and looking forward to walking in fashion and special decoration design.Sure enough, the exquisite and unique taste of each dish is reflecting the respect and familiarity of the food for the food.In order to create an excellent flavor.With wine.A very happy dinner.Will definitely visit again."
"現場服務人員都很好
只不過當下有被打破盤子聲音給影響到用餐氛圍。

點了商業午餐
套餐份量真的很足

/牛舌
本以為商業午餐只有一個卻來兩個有點小驚喜。

/爆米花濃湯🍲
哇嗚⋯真的超甜😅吃得出濃湯裡的洋蔥
但⋯可能是爆米花融化在湯裡面呈現有點焦糖味，導致湯變很甜

/伊比利豬
口感很棒👍🏻
喔喔⋯偏肥喔！

朋友點的
/炸透抽🦑
意外的好吃有種很親民的感覺

/奶油義大利麵
搭配麵體是寬麵
好吃濃郁唯一是吃完的一份餐點👍🏻

/甜點
附餐甜點芒果奶酪&單點巴斯克乳酪蛋糕🍰

總結：
氛圍還可以可能是中餐

餐點覺得還有很大的進步空間

服務人員可能還要細心⋯走路走一走掉筆
也不知道當天的當日甜點是什麼⋯也不知道蔬果汁是什麼，一間飯店來說這些都還有進步空間和增加專業。
還好沒有點威靈頓牛排，因為以上這些會抹滅掉這麼貴的餐點。","The on -site service staff are very good
It is just that the sound of the plate is broken at the moment.

Ordered a commercial lunch
The set meal is really sufficient

Beef tongue
I thought that there was only one commercial lunch but a little surprise.

/Popcorn soup 花
Wow, it's really sweet and can eat the onions in the thick soup
However, it may be that the popcorn melts in the soup a bit caramel, which makes the soup become very sweet.

/Ibilia pig
The taste is great 棒
Oh, it's fat!

Clicked
/Fried 抽 抽 抽 抽
Surprising and delicious, there is a feeling of being very close to the people

/Creamy Italian Noodles
Matching the face body is wide
The only delicious and rich is a meal that finished eating 👍🏻

/dessert
Sneak mango cheese & single -point Basque cheese cake 🍰

Summarize:
The atmosphere can also be Chinese food

I think there is still a lot of room for progress

The service staff may have to walk carefully and walk away
I do n’t know what the desserts were on the day ... I do n’t know what fruit and fruit juice is. For a restaurant, there is room for progress and increase professionalism.
Fortunately, there is no prestige steak, because the above will wipe out such a expensive meal."
"母親節大餐選在英迪格4樓的T.R bar&kitchen
這週末母親節餐已經都配好套餐形式
雙主餐的set有招牌無骨雞翅燉飯跟威靈頓牛排
對於2個大人來說反而比較剛好
看到很多人說平常來點威靈頓牛排建議3-4人分

一剛開始前菜帝王蟹肉跟白蘆筍上菜速度有夠快
幾乎是點完餐沒多久就接著上
可能是因為冷菜很早就事先做好備著
但後面開始上菜速度就正常許多
餐前麵包很普通我覺得不好吃
所以也沒特地拍照
牛肉澄清湯很鮮甜
老公說喝起來很像在臺南吃溫體牛的湯頭
第一次聽到霸王花還以為是寶可夢
口感很像金針花

中間還有一小塊石斑魚的熱菜
漁夫醬的蛤蜊味很濃郁很好吃

無骨雞翅燉飯的松露味很重
我覺得光是吃到這就很飽了
但是看到威靈頓牛排上桌還是忍不住吃光
威靈頓牛排的派皮很酥脆
5分熟的牛排雖然看起來很紅但不會有血水
牛排吃起來很軟嫩
雖然第一次吃威靈頓牛排無從比較
但我覺得這道很好吃
餐會甜點是三種不同口味的馬卡龍

總地來說
我覺得這餐很飽很滿足","Mother's Day dinner on T.R Bar & Kitchen on the 4th floor of Ingiger
This weekend has been equipped with a set of meals this weekend
The SET of the Double Main Meal has a signature signs without chicken wings stewed rice and Wellington steak
For 2 adults, it is more appropriate
Seeing a lot of people say that I usually come to the Verity steak and suggest 3-4 people points

As soon as the beginning of the vegetable emperor crab meat and white asparagus, there is enough speed to serve
It's almost not long after ordering
It may be because cold dishes are prepared in advance early
But the speed of serving at the back is much normal
The bread in front of the meal is very ordinary. I don't think it's delicious
So I didn't take a special photo
Beef clarified soup is very fresh and sweet
Husband said it is much like eating the soup in Tainan.
The first time I heard the Overlord Flower, I thought it was Pokémon
The taste is very much like a golden needle flower

There is a small piece of hot dishes of grouper in the middle
Fisherman sauce's clams are very strong and delicious

The flavor of the truffle without bone chicken wings stewed rice is very heavy
I think it's enough to eat this
But I can't help eating when I see the Wellington steak on the table
The Pippi of the Verity Steak is crispy
5 cooked steaks, although it looks red but there is no blood
The steak is very soft and tender
Although the first time I eat Wellington steak, I can't compare
But I think this is delicious
Meal dessert is three different flavors of macarons

Overall land
I think this meal is full and satisfied"
"服務人員的反應沒有星級飯店的水準，期望他們能做的更好，開放式廚房可以看到大廚現場料理，但大廚一直對著助理罵no no no然後一把接過料理盤，讓我覺得我吃到的餐點其實是不是失敗品😆
📍開胃菜地中海小卷串非常好吃，除了本人鮮嫩多汁之外內餡的搭配讓小卷變的更鮮甜了，搭配調製的辣沾醬也很對味，非常推薦
📍凱撒沙拉的調味完全沒有起司濃重的味道，反而有另外調味過，是非常清爽又能襯出蔬菜甜味的調醬，會很涮嘴
📍塞拉諾火腿pizza，這薄皮不是蓋的，充滿嚼勁又帶點Q，上層的火腿稍鹹了點也一點肉腥味都沒有，削的很薄與芝麻葉時而交錯著吃到也還可以一片接一片，深深被餅皮吸引，下次應該會嘗試基本的瑪格麗特
📍無骨雞翅燉飯實在太一般了，覺得如果雞肉能帶點香草味會更好吃，不過滿滿的松露味，香氣是100分的
📍起司四重奏pizza，$550，各種pizza各有不同口感，最好的是不會鹹，推薦給喜歡起司的人
📍緬因龍蝦細扁麵，龍蝦新鮮，醬汁香濃，只是$1180的價格偏高了點
📍南法烤章魚，$550，侍者說地中海小卷之後應該會因換菜單不再提供，覺得超可惜，章魚烤的軟硬適中，但調味上沒能很凸顯出食材的鮮味，還是沒有小卷來的好吃","The response of the service staff does not have the level of a star hotel. It is expected that they can do better. Open kitchen can see the chef's live cooking, but the chef has been scolding NO No No to the assistant and then took the cooking plate to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish and let the dish to let the dish and let the dish to let the dish and let the dish to let the dish to let the dish and let the dish to let the dish and let the dish to let the dish and let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish to let the dish and let the dishes to let the cook I think the meals I have eaten are actually failed products 😆
小 The appetizer Cunnar small roll skewers are very delicious. The matching of the filling of the fillings in addition to my fresh and juicy filling makes the small roll more sweet.
调 The seasoning of Caesar Salat has no flavor of the cheese, but has another seasoning. It is very refreshing and lined with the sweet sauce of vegetables.
P Sorano ham pizza, this thin skin is not covered, full of chewy and a little Q, the upper ham is a little salty and a little bit meaty, the cut is very thin and the sesame leaves are staggered and eaten. You can be attracted to the cakes one by one, and you should try the basic Margaret next time
The boneless chicken wings stewed rice is too ordinary. I think that if chicken can bring a little vanilla flavor, it will be better, but the flavor of the truffle is full.
P The cheese quadruple Pizza, $ 550, all kinds of Pizza each have different taste, the best is not to be salty, it is recommended to those who like cheese
细 Benin lobster fine flat surface, fresh lobster, strong sauce, but the price of $ 1180 is a bit higher
， Nanfa grilled octopus, $ 550. The waiter said that after the Mediterranean roll, it should not be provided because the menu is changed. It is a pity that the octopus roasting is moderate and moderate, but the seasoning does not highlight the umami flavor of the ingredients. Roll delicious"
"每道菜都非常獨特美味，不是外面可以常常嚐到的口味
白天跟晚上的氣氛各有風味
非常適合約會的一個好地方！！","Each dish is very unique and delicious, not the taste that can be tasted often outside

The small roll is quite good in the containing bag of tomato

終於吃到傳說中的威靈頓牛排了，牛柳鋪上鵝肝蘑菇醬外面再一層起司，加上法國主廚現場秀一波，舒服,"Finally, I ate the legendary Verity steak. The beef willow spreads the cheese outside the foie gras and mushroom sauce. In addition, the French chef show a wave of scenes, comfortable"
"最推松露野菇燉飯！非常好吃

"無語了! 特價3880四人餐號稱40oz牛，原來是含一個巨無霸骨頭啊！肉有12oz就要偷笑了！抱歉不值得可能最高極限2500 沒辦法更高
*雞肉沙拉毫無特色，雞肉更沒有碳烤處理過, 當然醬也是沒有，空虛
＊燉飯不錯，隔餐加熱也好吃
＊披薩濃湯味道不錯，烤蔬菜也好吃
＊麵包敗筆，尤其是圓麵包。取餐到公司5分鐘之內，圓麵包硬邦邦還超級乾硬……法式麵包也不怎樣。麵包敗筆建議直接取消，扣分項目
＊肉不是內用現吃，即使距離很近油脂已經凝固，嫩度還是有的，但調味味道幾乎沒有。抱歉這個號稱40oz分量含巨無霸骨頭沒法接受。
＊甜點應該是一人份吧。四人餐配這分量？？傻眼

飯店服務很好也很客氣，外帶還提供分裝紙盒很貼心. 。單買巧克力塔好吃，推推推","Silent! Special offer 3880 four -person meals are known as 40oz beef. It turned out to be a giant bone!There are 12oz with the meat and you will laugh!Sorry, it is not worth the maximum limit of 2500 cannot be higher
*Chicken salad has no special features, and chicken has no carbon roasting, of course, there is no sauce, empty
＊ Stewed rice is good, and it is delicious to heat from meals
＊ Pizza thick soup tastes good, and roasted vegetables are delicious
＊ Bread is defeated, especially round bread.Within 5 minutes to pick up the company, the round bread is still super dry ... French bread is not very good.It is recommended to cancel the bread losing pen, and the deduction items are deducted
＊ The meat is not used in the inside. Even if the distance is very close to the fat, the tenderness is still there, but there is almost no flavor.Sorry for this claiming 40oz component containing the giant bone bone cannot accept it.
＊ Dessert should be one person.This quantity of four people meals?IntersectionDumbfounded

牛排配菜感覺沒有甜味，可能烤過熟或不是太新鮮","The service attitude is good, but the food is a bit too fast. The table is full of dishes. It feels a bit like the speed of western food.

我們兩個女生用餐，為了配合我目前蔬食飲食，我們一人點一碗湯、加一份薯條、以及一份起司四重奏Pizza．
⚡️ ""法式蔬菜雞湯""，彷彿是蔬菜泡在水裡煮出來的味道，沒有雞湯的味道．😔
⚡️ ""黃金南瓜濃湯""，濃湯上以一些烤過的堅果以及鮮奶油點綴，看起來不錯，但一入口就發現很有問題，除了湯的溫度約莫只有60度，另外有非常嚴重的燒焦味，發現是那些堅果根本就燒焦了．服務人員先表示抱歉，說可能這批堅果烹煮時間比較長...  (很會用行銷話術)，但燒焦就是燒焦怎能端上桌呢？！！ 服務人員態度不錯，表示會請廚房重出一份，但過幾分鐘卻來詢問 可不可以請我換其他的湯？(不知道是不是廚房無法處理堅果.... )，但我跟服務人員說明我目前蔬食飲食，所以南瓜湯最適合，濃湯上不放堅果沒關係的．後來送上一碗熱呼呼的 、上面灑了培根碎片的南瓜湯.....😱我也只好默默地將培根碎片移走，再喝．😔
⚡️ ""脆炸細薯條""，在這樣的餐廳 薯條應該沒有意外 是好吃的才對，結果這一盤擺盤新潮 定價180 的薯條遠比不上麥當勞薯條！！！ 雖然薯條外表是脆的，但是裡面乾澀到不行，我分辨不出它是冷凍食材 還是回炸過的，總之照片可證 我們大約只吃十分之一 就不願意再吃了．😱
⚡️ ""起司四重奏Pizza""，ＣＰ值超低，麵皮彈性不夠，形狀是個整齊圓形，懷疑不是手工桿出的麵皮，Cheese香味也沒有層次😔 (這道pizza的精髓就是4種Cheese搭配 衝撞出的層次感，，大多數店家會選用藍紋乾酪，但非絕對)

整體來說 餐點口味令人非常失望．
給2星 是針對餐廳位置，環境，裝潢，現場服務的綜合考量．","Originally looking forward to the restaurant of the former deputy chef Frederic Jullien, the former deputy chef of the Michelin restaurant, and hired Michelin Restaurant Hou Buxiong L'Apoxione L'Atelier de Jo -l Robuchon. Then, then
The two girls dine. In order to cooperate with my current vegetable and food, we order a bowl of soup, add a fries, and a cheese quadrice to play Pizza.
菜 ️ ""French vegetable chicken soup"", as if the taste of vegetables soaked in water, without the taste of chicken soup.Bleak
️ ""Golden Pumpkin Soup"", the thick soup is embellished with some roasted nuts and fresh cream, which looks good, but it is found that there is a problem at the entrance. Except for the temperature of the soup, it is only about 60 degrees. In addition, there are very serious burning burning Focus, I found that those nuts were burnt at all.The service staff first expressed her sorry, saying that this batch of nuts may be cooking for a long time ... (very good for marketing), but how can the burnt of burning be served?IntersectionIntersectionThe service staff has a good attitude and said that he would ask the kitchen to retake, but after a few minutes, please ask me if I can ask me to change other soup?(I do n’t know if the kitchen cannot handle nuts ...), but I explained to the service staff to show that I am currently vegetables and food, so pumpkin soup is the most suitable. It does n’t matter if you do n’t put nuts on the soup.Later, a bowl of hot pumpkin soup with bacon fragments was sprinkled on it .... I had to silently remove the bacon fragments and drink.Bleak
薯 ️ ""Crispy French French French Fried French French French French French fries"", there should be no surprise in such a restaurant. As a result, the fries that is priced at 180 is far from McDonald's French fries!IntersectionIntersectionAlthough the appearance of the fries is crispy, but it is not enough to be dry, I can't tell whether it is frozen ingredients or fry it back.Bleak
️ ""Cheese Quarter Play Pizza"", the CP value is super low, the dough is not elastic, and the shape is neat and round. It is suspected that it is not the dough of the handmade pole. The sense of hierarchy, most stores will choose blue -patterned cheese, but it is not absolute)

Overall the taste of meals is very disappointing.
Givening 2 stars is a comprehensive consideration for the location, environment, decoration, and on -site service of the restaurant."
"巧克力控別錯過的「享嚐黑可可」／T. R Bar & Kitchen

如果是喜歡巧克力的朋友，我很推薦這個結合多種形態巧克力，口感豐富有致的點心──「享嚐黑可可」（250+10%）。

「享嚐黑可可」把法芙娜 （Valrhona）出品的70%瓜那哈（Guanaja）巧克力 製成冰淇淋之後混合巧克力餅乾碎，上桌前淋上巧克力醬，並以細枝巧克力與金箔點綴，在對比鮮明的色澤中散發赤裸而原始的誘人氣息。

70%的瓜那哈（Guanaja）巧克力本身不太甜，所以當它在嘴裡融化時，會先感受到微苦中閃過的一縷酸香，接著才是清新淡雅的花果香氣蔓延開來；加上巧克力餅乾碎的酥脆、細枝巧克力的欲拒還迎，以及巧克力醬絲緞般的滑順，是一種分開來各顯神通，合起來所向披靡的多層次風韻；即便是完全融化的狀態，也是可以拿去沾麵包吃，簡直是絲毫不浪費，點滴都美味。","""Enjoy the Black Coco"" / T. R Bar & Kitchen that the chocolate controlled

If you are a friend who likes chocolate, I recommend this combination of a variety of forms of chocolate, which has a rich texture of the texture -""Enjoy Black Coco"" (250+10%).

""Enjoy Black Coco"" Mixed chocolate biscuits made 70%of Valrhona's guanaja chocolate, drizzled with chocolate sauce before serving, and dotted with fine branches and gold foil. A naked and primitive attractive atmosphere in the contrasting color.

70%of the guanaja chocolate itself is not too sweet, so when it melts in the mouth, it will feel a ray of sour fragrance flashes in the slight bitterness, and then the fresh and elegant flower and fruit aroma spreads away. Come; plus the crispy crispy of chocolate biscuits, the refusal of fine -branched chocolate, and the smooth smoothness of chocolate sauce silk satin, it is a multi -level charm to show its magical powers and co -izel; even if it is completely melted completely The state of the state can also be taken to eat with bread. It is simply not wasted at all, and it is delicious."

"點牛排並未詢問熟度，上餐後三份熟度不一樣，其中一份熟度超高，向店員反應後得到的回應是「因為這份是豬排」？
後續上餐速度也很慢，整家餐廳只有同行的20人在用餐，一杯冰紅茶要等20分鐘，唯一好吃的是甜點，其他都很失望
最後，地板還黏黏的，一家飯店餐廳可以擁有燒臘店的環境，也不知道是幸還是不幸","The order of order did not ask the maturity. After the meal, the three maturity degree was different. One of them was very mature. The response after responding to the clerk was ""because this is a pork chop""?
The subsequent meal speed is also very slow. Only 20 people who are peers in the entire restaurant are dining. A glass of ice black tea needs to wait 20 minutes. The only delicious one is dessert.

"此次為二訪，第一次是飯店房客，早餐和午餐，印象不錯，所以並未在意朋友的負評。

但這次是非常失望的一餐，我是第一次吃到同一種醬汁用在白蘆筍（不新鮮的口感，接近茄子的軟硬度），干貝和魚上，而且深海魚煮到乾，也是不簡單🤬。

雖然看不清隔壁桌點了什麼，但是那個外國人也是才下刀沒多久，立馬要求退菜！

一問之下，服務生承認主廚不在！ 下面的廚師亂煮一通，真是叫人難以理解，如果這間餐廳只有義大利麵和pizza好吃，就不要賣別的。

服務生親切，但是上菜不上餐具，每上一道要提醒一次，這樣的餐廳真應該有人好好整頓一下。

白白浪費我的胃和時間🤪，至於送來抱歉的禮物（粽子禮盒之類的），看的出誠意，但是我不是為此而來，放在原地未取。 畢竟心情受影響，是無法彌補的🙄","This time I was a second visit. The first time was a hotel tenant, breakfast and lunch, I was impressed, so I did not care about the negative reviews of my friends.

But this time is a very disappointed meal. For the first time, I have eaten the same sauce for white asparagus (not fresh taste, close to the hardness of eggplant), scallops and fish, and deep -sea fish are cooked to dry until dry to dry. It's not easy.

Although I can't see what the next table is ordered, the foreigner did not take a long time, and immediately asked to refund the vegetables!

As soon as he was asked, the waiter admitted that the chef was not!The chef below cooks a mess, which is really difficult to understand. If this restaurant has only Italian noodles and Pizza delicious, don't sell anything else.

The waiter is kind, but the food is not served on the tableware. Every time you want to remind you, someone should really rectify such a restaurant.

Waste my stomach and time. As for the sorry gifts (dumplings gift boxes and the like), I see sincere, but I do n’t come here for this.After all, the mood is affected, it is impossible to make up for it"
起司漢堡外帶，薯條附三種醬料，漢堡肉新鮮紮實多汁。,"The cheese burger takes three sauces with fries, and the burger is fresh and solid."
場地大，氣氛好，食物佳，大推威靈頓牛排,"The venue is large, the atmosphere is good, the food is good."
氣氛好餐點有水準，慶生約會很推薦,"The atmosphere is good at meals, and the birthday is recommended for dating"
在本餐廳享用早餐，環境明亮與適度的裝飾，沒有鼎沸喧嘩人聲，但更不會如圖書館般安靜。讓客人在舒服自在的氣氛下，開啟一天活動。,"Enjoy breakfast in this restaurant, the environment is bright and moderate decoration, there is no such thing as a noisy noise, but it will not be as quiet as the library.Let guests start a day of activities in a comfortable and comfortable atmosphere."

椅子有點硬。其他都還好。包廂比較安靜,The chair is a bit hard.Everything else is fine.The box is relatively quiet
空間漂亮，料理口味非常道地，重新詮釋！,"The space is beautiful, the taste taste is very authentic, re -interpretation!"
聖誕節去的；餐前的麵包不脆，普羅旺斯海鮮魚湯不熱，牛小排口感也不像牛排（比較像一般的烤牛肉）。唯一一個有點特別的是洋蔥濃湯，但主要是炸洋蔥的視覺效果；實際搭配喝起來只覺得像被洋蔥爆擊，沒有那種和諧balanced的口感。當天用餐整體而言令人非常失望。,"Go to Christmas; the bread before the meal is not crispy, the Provence seafood fish soup is not hot, and the taste of beef is not like steak (more like ordinary grilled beef).The only one is a bit special is the onion soup, but it is mainly the visual effect of fried onions; the actual matching only feels like being hit by onions, without the taste of harmonious Balanced.It was very disappointing to dine on that day."

I have called for being late, and the restaurant still has a very intimate reply. Please take your time and drive carefully.The dining space is spacious and comfortable."
"湯好喝，尤其是那個烤的超酥的麵包然後上面加了我也不知道是什麼但加在一起真的很好吃的，但是就因為我想說湯這麼好喝其他應該不會雷吧，就點了牛舌跟牛排，我只能說不是我的菜，和牛牛排好硬😭，甚至讓我覺得我自己去costco買菲力自己回家先烤後煎都比較好吃，而且因為牛排要2000多又不好吃實在是心痛欸，牛舌感覺有一股很神秘的味道但不是我的菜，可以感受到這家店應該是有很多創意，但我本人只喜歡湯的創意，牛排就😔，說不定喜歡的人會喜歡啦
Btw我是用uber叫的喔 …","The soup is delicious, especially the grilled super crispy bread and I don't know what it is on it, but it is really delicious together, but because I want to say that the soup is so delicious , I ordered the beef tongue and steak. I can only say that it is not my dish. He and the cattle steak are hard, and even make me feel that I go to COSTCO to buy Feili to go home and bake it. It is heartache for more than 2000 but not delicious. It feels a mysterious taste but it is not my dish. You can feel that this shop should have a lot of creativity, but I only like the creativity of soup. Alas, maybe people who like it will like it
BTW I called Uber ..."

一星評價給的是廚房的出餐控管能力，今日預約12點取餐，卻等到13:20才拿到餐點，等非常久，所有預約訂單都delay，剛好是父親節訂餐要慶祝，卻遇上餐點無法準時很掃興，希望可以改進SOP，前台只有一位小姐在lobby要忙處理客人抱怨，邊道歉還要確認訂單無誤很可憐，雖然餐點還不錯吃，但這種體驗很讓人卻步。,"One -star evaluation is given to the kitchen's meal control ability. Booking the meal at 12 o'clock today, but it until 13:20 to get the meal. For a long time, all the appointment orders are delay. However, when I encountered meals, I couldn't get rid of it on time. I hope to improve the SOP. Only one lady at the front desk is busy handling guests complaining. I also confirm that the order is poor. Although the meal is good, this experience is very very good It is prohibitive."
"風景好氣氛好、服務人員也很好👍🏻
吃的部分沒有達到期望：海鮮披薩裡面有吃到殼、燉飯味道不夠","The scenery is good and the atmosphere is good, the service staff is also very good
The part of the food does not reach expectations: there is a shell in the seafood pizza, and the taste of rice stew is not enough"
"地方是漂亮

"8/30前往用下午茶，用餐經驗不佳，服務流程跟人員訓練都需要再加強。

「法式Pizza甜點屋」下午茶吃到飽的方案為15:00-17:00，檸檬塔、莓果塔、芒果派、蘋果派、草莓抹茶、咖啡巧克力、煙燻鮭魚、青醬雞肉共8款口味pizza，搭配咖啡、茶，無限續點。

15:00前即到櫃檯報到，接待人員告知可至戶外座位區稍後(室內等候區座位已滿)，時間到會再通知我們進來，但時間到時，看到接待人員忙著接待已排起隊伍的客人，並沒有任何一位工作人員到戶外區通知在外面等候的客人，我們趕緊回到櫃台，跟著人群排了一陣子隊才入座，這時候感覺已經有點不大舒服。

入座後，工作人員拿起桌上的餐牌請我們看菜單，但因為菜單很簡單，幾乎不需要想太多就可以點餐，但工作人員們仍舊在忙碌的帶位，每桌客人都眼巴巴的看著走來走去的工作人員們，但都還無法點餐。

後來終於有人來替我們點餐，逐桌的一次點完一區客人，可以想見等等餐點應該會等候許久才一一送達，但因為飲料先送到，等候時可以先喝飲品所以還好，但入座已經半個多小時，其他桌的餐點也都陸續送到，整區唯獨我們這桌還沒上菜，詢問了其中一位工作人員，表示餐點現點現做，所以請我們再稍後。再過一會，覺得別桌客人都在吃第二輪的餐點了，忍不住又問了一位工作人員是否我們的單有什麼問題，被告知會再確認我們的餐點；但直到晚了近20分鐘才入座的隔壁桌也上菜了，我又詢問了一位工作人員確認我這桌的單是否有問題，告知隔壁桌晚到的客人都上菜了，為何我們還沒上菜，得到的回應是""因為口味一樣的會累積單子一起做，所以會有這個狀況""。

這時候不惱火都很難，到底是""餐點現點現做""還是""某個口味累積到一定的單才做""?? 若是一樣的口味會一起做，為何別桌點了跟我們相同的口味早早就上菜了，但我們的餐點還沒來？而工作人員的處理方式也只是給了一個看是制式的回應，沒有感受到有真的去確認我們的點單是否出了狀況。

最後我們餐點快到15:50才送到，一個只有兩小時的無限續方案，第一個餐送達的時間已用掉快一小時，真的毫無誠意。","8/30 to use afternoon tea, the meal experience is poor, and the service process and personnel training need to be strengthened.

The ""French Pizza Dessert House"" afternoon tea is full. Pizza, with coffee, tea, unlimited continuity.

Report at the counter before 15:00, and the reception staff informed that you can go to the outdoor seat area later (the seats in the indoor waiting area are full), and the time will be notified to come in, but when the time is here, the reception staff is busy receiving the ranking. There were no staff members who started the team, and no staff member went to the outdoor area to notify the guests waiting outside. We hurried back to the counter and followed the crowd for a while to seat. At this time, it felt a bit uncomfortable.

After entering, the staff picked up the menu on the table and asked us to watch the menu, but because the menu is very simple, there is almost no need to want too much to order, but the staff are still busy. Looking at the staff walking around, they couldn't order food.

Later, someone finally came to order for us. After ordering a table with a table, a district guests can be seen for a long time to wait for a long time to get them one by one, but because the drink is delivered first, you can drink drinks first when you wait. Okay, but it has been more than half an hour, and the meals at other tables have been delivered one after another. The entire area has not been served in our table. I asked one of the staff and said that the meal was made and made, so Please later.After a while, I felt that the guests at the table were eating the second round of meals. I couldn't help but asked a staff member if there was any problem with our order, and was told that I would confirm our meals again; but until until The next table next door was also served in the next table for nearly 20 minutes. I asked a staff member to confirm whether there was a problem with the order of my table and inform the guests who arrived late at the table next door. The response obtained by the dishes is that ""because the taste will accumulate the list together, there will be this situation.""

It is difficult to be annoyed at this time. Whether ""meals now now"" or ""some taste accumulate to a certain order"" ?? If the same taste will be made together, why not order the same table as us, the same is the same as us as us. The taste has been served early, but our meals have not come yet?The handling method of the staff only gave a response to the system, and did not feel that there was a real confirmation of our order.

In the end, we were delivered until 15:50. A two -hour unlimited continuation plan. The first meal was delivered for almost an hour. It was really sincere."

「發生了極為不愉快消費經驗」

首先發生貴店針對消費方式無法讓客人第一時間理解之情況；暨上述情況衍生後面發生與桌邊「服務員B」確認後進行上菜時時一位最初帶位「服務員A」使用態度極為不禮貌的態度回頭與我們爭執消費金額⋯

以下為對話內容陳述⋯ （我稱M）

服務員A：你們每一位用餐的人頭都需要收費！

M：
可是剛才跟服務員B先生確認過，其中一位只要不使用飲品及不需要算人頭，那位B先生在那邊你可以跟他確認！

服務員A：我們就是要付費！(音量拉高)

M：我們不是要貪這點錢，遊戲規則是你們告知我們，妳可以親自問你們同仁而不是要問我們才對！

服務員A：所以是那位先生說的嗎！那你們不用付錢了，公司會扣他的錢⋯(隨即態度不悅轉頭離開⋯)

*遊戲規則都是你們訂的！
請問這位女服務員A妳態度到底在差什麼呢？

1.我們已告知不貪圖這單人600多元的消費！
2.我太太告知她孕婦吃不了太多也喝白開水不使用飲品並取得貴店同意不計人頭消費也遵循你們同意！
3.即便內部有問題也不應該對客人態度如此不客氣！！今天消費心得令人失望！！

這三點我絕對不會服氣，因為我們重來不當奧客！

最後仍必須感謝服務員DAVID CHEN於整件事情耐心與我們講解與致歉，雖然對我們態度不好的不是您，但讓我們家人感受到您處理整件事情的用心與為客人著想，值得嘉許與鼓勵！辛苦了，謝謝🙏

3. Even if there are problems inside, you should not be so polite to the guests!IntersectionToday's consumption experience is disappointing!Intersection

I will never be convinced these three points, because we come back to an Austrian!

In the end, we must also thank the waiter David Chen to explain and apologize to us with patience with us. Although it is not you who have a bad attitude towards us, let our family feel the intention of dealing with the whole thing and thinking for guests. IntersectionHard hard, thank you ，

The above is for those who need meals to think about five -star hotel services."
價格合理！環境舒適！菜色選擇性少！很美麗的磨石子地！讓人驚艷！龍蝦麵像南洋風！每個單點份量很足夠！甜點讓人有點失望！其餘都算滿意！,Reasonable price!Comfortable environment!The dishes are less selective!Very beautiful millstone!It's amazing!Lobster noodles look like Nanyang Wind!Each single point is sufficient!Dessert is a bit disappointed!The rest are satisfied!
威靈頓牛排肉質軟嫩、派皮酥脆，很有飽足感，第一次吃覺得比其他牛排口味豐富。窗外視野廣，覺得舒適。,"Wellington steak meat is soft and tender, crispy and crispy, and is full of satiety. For the first time, it feels richer than other steak flavors.The field of vision outside the window is comfortable."
父親節訂你們的餐點真的是悲劇，訂12點拿餐卻等到13:30才能拿到餐點，這個出餐流程真的不應該是四星級飯店會發生的狀況，卻只會一直讓櫃檯跟現場人員道歉，餐點卻還是出不來，流程到底是出了什麼問題？好好的節日聚餐卻因為餐點的失誤讓全家苦等沒東西可以吃，真的是場惡夢。,"Father's Day ordering your meals is really a tragedy. Booking at 12 o'clock to get the meal until 13:30 to get the meal. This meal process should not be the situation where a four -star restaurant will happen, but it will only always always be Let the counter apologize to the people at the scene, but the meal is still unable to come out. What is wrong with the process?A good festival dinner but because of the mistakes of the meal, the family was suffering from something to eat. It was really a nightmare."
和牛好吃，風景好看，椅子好坐，工作人員又親切，當然要來。,"He Niu is delicious, the scenery is good, the chair is good, the staff is kind, and of course come."
威靈頓牛排跟甜點很棒，可惜IHG會員的優惠限平日，另外有些看起來像工讀生的外場有點不在狀況內，但是整體還是很不錯的,"Wellington steak and dessert are great, but unfortunately IHG members' discounts are limited to on weekdays. In addition, some seem to be a bit out of the situation like a student, but the overall is still very good."
"吃到酸掉的和牛只說再換一份（？）誰敢再吃？！
明明有很多員工在走來走去巡場卻沒看到客人有需求，明顯教育訓練不足，
結帳拿走信用卡後再也沒回來後來真的等太久才發現根本就放在櫃臺沒人理，那何必桌邊結帳？
餐點都很普通，這個服務跟水準不會再2訪，謝謝。","Who dares to eat the sour peace and say that you can change it again (?) Who dares to eat it again?Intersection
Obviously, many employees are walking around to tour but did not see the needs of the guests. It is obvious that the education and training are insufficient.
After getting off the credit card at the checkout, I never returned and I really waited for too long. I found that it was not ignored at the counter at all.
The meals are very ordinary. This service and standard will not visit again, thank you."
無骨雞翅燉飯好吃，香濃不膩口。威靈頓牛排熟度適中，還有主廚桌邊分切服務👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 …,"Boneless chicken wings stewed rice is delicious, and the fragrant is not greasy.Wellington cattle are well matured, and the chef's table is cut off the service 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 ..."
"法式甜點pizza屋吃到飽，pizza並不特別驚豔，覺得沒有那個價值
還吃到鐵絲（當天太累了，加上服務人員感覺也不怎麼想理人，就沒有反應了
當日出餐系統似乎有些問題，隔壁桌來了1小時只上了一道菜
廚房似乎有些糾紛，感覺自己員工在吵架，大聲到引起客人注意，覺得不太ok
員工訓練和廚房品質感覺還需要好好訓練","French dessert Pizza is full, Pizza is not particularly amazing, I feel that there is no value
I also eaten the wire (I am too tired that day, and the service staff doesn’t think much, so I did not respond
There seems to be some problems with the meal system that day, and only one dish came in the table next door.
There seems to be some disputes in the kitchen. I feel that their employees are quarreling, so loudly to attract guests' attention.
Employee training and the quality of kitchen need to be trained well"
品味豐富，精緻美味，讓人美好的一天從這豐盛早餐開始！,"The taste is rich, delicate and delicious, and the beautiful day starts from this rich breakfast!"
在大直英迪格酒店內，氣氛良好，食物、調酒都在水準之上，推薦肋眼牛排。,"In Da Zhiying Dig Hotel, the atmosphere is good, and food and bartending are above the standard. It is recommended that ribs steak."
令人驚艷的用餐體驗，菜色精緻多元，服務無可挑剔。極力推薦。,"The amazing dining experience, the dishes are exquisite and diverse, and the service is impeccable.Strongly recommend."
絕對值得一試的美味盛宴，菜品精緻味道超群！五星推薦。,"Absolutely worthy of a delicious feast, the delicate dishes are superb!Five -star recommendation."
餐廳服務員的素質很差，不會主動打招呼，收盤時也不會問是否可以收盤，餐飲的餐點的內容也不會做簡單說明，回覆時冷漠不關心的態度，對服務員說謝謝，也不會回覆客戶不客氣或微笑以對，服務態度有待改善，但餐點品質還是不錯 所以願意給兩顆星  服務方面就有點可惜  下午4點酒肉狂跟隔天飯店早餐用餐體驗都不是很好,"The quality of the restaurant waiter is very poor, and will not take the initiative to say hello. When closing the market, you will not ask if you can close it. The content of the meal of the catering will not make a brief explanation. Reply to the customer's polite or smile, the service attitude needs to be improved, but the quality of the meal is still good, so it is a bit unfortunately willing to give the two star services. Unfortunately, the wine and meat crazy in the afternoon and the restaurant breakfast dining experience the next day are not very good."
場地好 服務佳 好吃,"The site is good service and good, delicious"
看網路上人家介紹來的，環境很不錯、餐點也不錯，給Vivian的服務五星評價，謝謝你的服務，輕鬆舒適😌～,"Look at the people introduced on the Internet, the environment is very good, and the meal is also good. The service for Vivian has a five -star evaluation, thank you for your service, easy and comfortable ~"
大片採光良好的落地窗，增添假日悠閒的用餐氛圍。餐點用心美味不在話下，服務人員親切服務，遠勝很多五星級飯店！,"Large lighting windows with good lighting add a leisurely dining atmosphere.The meal is delicious with heart, and the service staff will be kindly served, which is far better than many five -star hotels!"
近幾年吃到最好吃的肋眼牛排，調酒也令人驚艷。,"In recent years, the best rib -eye steak has been eaten, and bartending is also amazing."

"1. Happy hour，主菜需要的熱壓吐司機，整個餐廳只有一台，所有人都被迫排隊等
2. 早餐點炒蛋，超過半小時，早餐都吃完了，餐點都還沒上桌","1. Happy Hour, the hot vomiting driver required by the main course, there is only one whole restaurant, everyone is forced to line up, etc.

第一次給人一顆心服務生人員根本不夠，菜品不夠，不推薦。,"For the first time, it is not enough to give a heart waiter. The dishes are not enough and are not recommended."
無骨雞翅燉飯好好吃！,Boneless chicken wings stewed rice is delicious!
早餐很棒，但服務人員送錯餐（已用餐主餐後，繼續再送），雖然很好吃，但已經吃不下了,"Breakfast is great, but the service staff sends the wrong meal (after the meal, continue to be delivered), although it is delicious, it can’t be eaten anymore"
"威靈頓牛排很特別好吃值得嘗試。

"威靈頓牛排很好吃

吃完前菜章魚，立刻嚴重腹瀉，所謂高檔義大利餐廳，食材不鮮，令人失望,"After eating the octopus before eating, severe diarrhea. The so -called high -end Italian restaurant, the ingredients are not uncommon, disappointing"

"總的來說，這是一次非常令人失望的經驗。我和我的妻子去了情人節套餐。如果你花 9,000 新台幣吃一頓飯，你會期望它會很棒。這是最好的平均水平。品質不錯，但是味道差了點。當我們到達時，花了 20 分鐘才送來一份很小的沙拉。這可能是我見過的最小的沙拉。味道不是很好。好吧，我說過讓我們給他們更多時間來改進。又等了20 分鐘，我問我們的下一盤什麼時候來，他拿出了蝦和鮑魚，因為我們等了太久，儘管菜單上沒有（這就是為什麼他們得到了2 星而不是1 星） 。然後他們拿出了所謂的波士頓龍蝦，這是一個謊言，因為它有一隻大蝦那麼大。味道不錯，但菜單是騙人的。
接下來是他們所謂的洋蔥湯。這真的不是湯，比較像是碗裡的炒洋蔥。嘗起來就像他們倒了太多醣。超級甜，我真的只是因為太餓了才吃完。最後一道菜是我們來的原因，那就是惠靈頓牛肉。擺盤很漂亮，牛排也準備得很好。但裡面混合了松露和鴨肝（這兩種東西都沒有列在英文菜單上，我都不喜歡這些東西）。松露和鴨肝太多了，當威靈頓切開時，一切都散架了。這很令人反感，而且味道也不好。甜點看起來也很漂亮，但餡餅餡太甜了，我不敢相信他們在台灣供應這個。我是美國人，我喜歡甜食，但我知道台灣人不能接受太甜的東西。坐在我旁邊的夫婦吃了一口，還沒吃完。每個拿到情人節菜單的人都顯得失望。大多數人都沒有吃完盤子裡的食物。對於如此昂貴的東西來說非常令人震驚。我不會推薦也不會考慮回到這裡。

評論從 2 星改為 1 星，因為兩週後，餐廳沒有人聯繫我。","In general, this is a very disappointing experience.My wife and I went to Valentine's Day package.If you spend a meal of NT $ 9,000, you will expect it to be great.This is the best average.The quality is good, but the taste is worse.When we arrived, it took 20 minutes to send a small salad.This may be the smallest salad I have ever seen.The taste is not very good.Well, I said that let us give them more time to improve.After waiting for another 20 minutes, I asked our next set when he came, and he took out shrimp and abalone because we waited too long, although there was no on the menu (this is why they got 2 stars instead of 1 star) EssenceThen they took out the so -called Boston lobster, which was a lie because it was as large as a shrimp.The taste is good, but the menu is deceiving.
Next is their so -called onion soup.This is really not soup, it is more like fried onions in a bowl.It tastes like they poured too much sugar.Super sweet, I really finished eating because I was too hungry.The last dish is the reason for us, that is Wellington beef.The plate is very beautiful, and the steak is well prepared.But there are truffle and duck liver (none of these things are listed on the English menu, I don't like these things).There are too many truffles and duck liver. When Wellington is cut, everything is scattered.This is disgusted and the taste is not good.The dessert looks very beautiful, but the pie stuffing is too sweet. I can't believe they supply this in Taiwan.I am an American, I like sweets, but I know Taiwanese people cannot accept too sweet things.The couple sitting next to me took a bite and hadn't finished eating.Everyone who got the Valentine's Wiral Menu was disappointed.Most people do not eat food on the plate.It is very shocking for such expensive things.I won't recommend it or consider returning here.

The comment changed from 2 stars to 1 star, because two weeks later, no one contacted me in the restaurant."
"昨晚，我們的大家庭（14 人）在 TR 的私人房間裡吃了晚餐。我第一次去那裡，在查看了他們網站上的菜單後，我真的很期待這頓飯。我喜歡餐廳的現代裝飾和整體設計，但對食物的品質沒有留下深刻的印象。擺盤很漂亮，但大多數菜餚都很平淡。

麵包籃：從名字來看，我以為籃子裡有各種麵包可供選擇，但事實並非如此。我們都買了兩塊同樣的塗有奶油的麵包。

帕瑪火腿配甜瓜：不錯 - 調味料與 .

爆米花雜燴：我晚上最喜歡的菜！味道非常好，爆米花和迷你玉米片為奶油雜燴增添了美味的口感。

慢煮鮑魚：擺盤很漂亮，但鮑魚又淡又硬。不要點這道菜。

扇貝：軟，但有點未煮熟。奶油土豆搭配得很好。

蒸紅石斑魚：我媽媽點了這道菜——份量很大，但味道平淡。

和牛M7：我等待品嚐的主菜非常生。我沾了辣椒醬，但太霸道了。我無法決定什麼是最糟糕的：無味的生和牛還是辛辣的胡椒肉汁。我吃了 1/2 的 4 盎司和牛；無法強迫自己吃剩下的。

每日甜點：原來是一片釉面磅蛋糕，味道怪怪的。我只吃了兩小口。

除了主菜外，每道菜都及時地送到了每個人的面前。每道主菜之間有 6 至 10 分鐘的間隔。首先是豬肉，然後是肋眼牛排，然後是石斑魚，最後是和牛。似乎只有一位廚師，他/她一次只準備一種主菜。由於四道和牛是最後上的，我想知道它沒煮熟的原因是否是因為廚師的時間不夠了，第一道主菜和最後一道主菜之間有 20-25 分鐘的間隔。  主菜的時機確實不對。

服務很好；工作人員很細心，但美食體驗令人失望，不值得付出的代價。","Last night, our big family (14 people) had dinner in TR's private room.I went there for the first time, and after checking the menu on their website, I really looked forward to this meal.I like the modern decoration and overall design of the restaurant, but I don't have a deep impression on the quality of food.The plate is very beautiful, but most dishes are bland.

Bread basket: From the perspective of the name, I think there are various breads in the basket to choose from, but this is not the case.We both bought two pieces of the same cream.

Pama ham with melon: good -seasoning and.

Popcorn hodgepodge: My favorite dish at night!The taste is very good, popcorn and mini corn slices add a delicious taste to cream hodgepodes.

Slowly cook abalone: ​​The plate is beautiful, but the abalone is light and hard.Don't order this dish.

Scallop: soft, but a bit unsuspicious.Cream potatoes are well matched.

Steamed red grouper: My mother ordered this dish -the portion is very large, but the taste is plain.

He Niu M7: The main cuisine I wait for taste is very raw.I was stained with chili sauce, but it was too domineering.I can't decide what is the worst: tasteless raw and beef or spicy pepper gravy.I ate 1/2 of 4 ounces and cows; I couldn't force myself to eat the rest.

Daily dessert: It turned out to be a glaze pound cake, which tastes strange.I only took two little bit.

In addition to the main dishes, each dish was sent to everyone in time.Each main course has a 6 to 10 minutes interval.The first is pork, then rib -eye steak, then grouper, and the last is a cow.It seems that there is only one chef, and he/she only prepares one main dish at a time.Since Si Dao and cows are last, I want to know whether the reason why it is not cooked is because the chef's time is not enough. There is a 20-25 minutes between the first main dish and the last main course.The timing of the main course is really wrong.

The service is very good; the staff is very careful, but the food experience is disappointing and the price is not worth paying."
"氣氛很好。服務還是不錯的，所有的服務生都很熱情，有禮貌。

但食物真的……無味，沒什麼味道。

黑麵包又厚又淡。黃油包味道不錯。
凱薩沙拉：培根太少，醬汁太甜。雞肉很軟但是一點味道都沒有。
炸魷魚：有點苦，醬汁並沒有為這道菜增添亮點……令人驚訝。
馬賽魚湯：看起來很漂亮，味道也不錯，魚和貽貝煮得太熟了。
龍蝦燴飯：Blandddd。不知道為什麼，龍蝦不甜…

食物有點失望，看起來不錯，但味道與價格不符。","The atmosphere is very good.The service is still good, all the waiters are very enthusiastic and polite.

But the food is really ... tasteless, there is no taste.

Black bread is thick and light.The butter bag tastes good.
Caesar salad: There are too few bacon, and the sauce is too sweet.The chicken is soft but there is no taste at all.
Fried squid: A little bitter, the sauce did not add highlights to this dish ... surprising.
Marseille Soup: It looks beautiful and tastes good.
Lobster risotto: Blandddd.I don’t know why, lobster is not sweet ...

The food is a bit disappointed and looks good, but the taste does not match the price."
"一家有很多故事的飯店。如果你仔細觀察，你會發現細節中的美。從磚廠、基隆江端午，到可愛的小鴨子、蝴蝶園，台北大直英迪格酒店真正將大直在地的故事融入設計中。看到一家有深度街區故事的酒店，真是美妙又令人耳目一新！

另一方面，TR Bar & Kitchen 始終超越標準。 cp值相當高，因為大部分飯店的食物都和機場一樣哈哈，TR Bar & Kitchen 給顧客帶來精緻的用餐體驗，而且價格也相當實惠！太棒了！","A restaurant with many stories.If you look closely, you will find the beauty in the details.From the brick factories, the Keelungjiang Dragon Boat Festival, to the cute duckling and butterfly garden, the Taipei Dazhiying Dig Hotel truly integrates the story of Dazhi into the design.It is wonderful and refreshing to see a hotel with deep block stories!

On the other hand, TR Bar & Kitchen has always surpassed the standard.The CP value is quite high, because most restaurants are the same as the airport haha. Tr Bar & Kitchen brings a delicate dining experience to customers, and the price is quite affordable!marvelous!"
優質的服務，美味的食物，味道不像典型的類似餐廳。菜餚可能看起來與城裡的許多菜餚相似，但區別在於口味，這些感覺像是正宗的歐洲風味。,"High -quality services, delicious food, taste not like typical restaurants.The dishes may look similar to many dishes in the city, but the difference is taste, which feels like authentic European flavor."
"美味的食物，良好的氛圍，友好的員工。
喜歡食物的介紹。  強烈推薦給家庭和孩子聚會。","Delicious food, good atmosphere, friendly employees.

環境舒適，食物美味，服務周到。非常適合朋友或家人聚會。,"Comfortable environment, delicious food, thoughtful service.Very suitable for friends or family members."
這裡的食物和人都很美味，強烈推薦 TR 酒吧和廚房！,"The food and people here are delicious, strongly recommend TR bar and kitchen!"
一位家庭成員在這裡吃了生日晚餐。服務非常好，但是我不確定當這個地方很忙時是否會發生這種情況。 （那天晚上只有兩張桌子，因為是星期一）我也喜歡這裡的食物。外面還有一個露台酒吧，您可以在晚餐後與家人和朋友一起閒逛。會再次訪問,"A family member had a birthday and dinner here.The service is very good, but I'm not sure if this happens when this place is busy.(There are only two tables that night, because it is Monday) I also like the food here.There is also a terrace bar outside, you can wander with your family and friends after dinner.Will visit again"
羊排份量超足！,Sheep chops are super sufficient!
還有改進的空間...無論是膳食還是服務,There is also room for improvement ... whether it is diet or service
"感謝廚師 Fred 和他的團隊，今天度過了非常非常愉快的時光。
一系列美味而精緻的品嚐。
他知道如何突出所有海鮮產品（扇貝、章魚、鮭魚）以及陸地產品（非常嫩的小牛排或豬肉，總是與小蔬菜巧妙地結合在一起）。
特別值得一提的是甜點（冰糕或用時令草莓製成的提拉米蘇），特別適合已經吃飽的美食家。
做得好 ！","Thanks to the chef Fred and his team for spending a very, very pleasant time today.
A series of delicious and delicate tasting.
He knows how to highlight all seafood products (scallops, octopus, salmon) and land and land products (very tender calf steaks or pork, always cleverly combined with small vegetables).
It is particularly worth mentioning is desserts (sow or Tiramisu made of timely strawberries), which is especially suitable for gourmets that are already full.
well done !"
美麗、維護良好的餐廳。  食物很棒。  喜歡自助早餐。  感謝晚上的服務員 Cindy 和早上的服務員 Hazel，他們提供了優質的服務和出色的英語幫助。,"Beautiful and well -maintained restaurants.The food is great.Like buffet breakfast.Thanks to the waiter Cindy and the morning waiter Hazel in the evening, they provide high -quality service and excellent English help."
