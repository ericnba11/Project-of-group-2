"在北海岸吃完午餐，吃下午茶及甜點的好地方。
通常點個手沖咖啡及一份甜點，假日有低消NT$300元，限時90分鐘，沒有其他人候位的話，可以繼續坐，只有被提醒過一次要90分鐘。
手沖咖啡是用保溫瓶裝的，味道水準之上，因為保溫瓶材質的關係，咖啡放久會味道差一點，建議可以稍微喝快一點。
熱鐵鍋德式鬆餅，如果沒吃過，建議一定要點一次，外皮烤得有酥，裏面的皮軟嫩，有兩球冰淇淋、米香及各式水果搭配著吃，滿滿好滋味。
司康除了原味，還可以選一種口味，司康外酥，裏面鬆鬆地，甜味適度，是搭配咖啡的好選擇。
巴斯克乳酪蛋糕，跟一般乳酪起司蛋糕味道差異不多。
這是看海及喝下午茶推薦的好地方。","After lunch on the North Coast, afternoon tea and desserts are good.
Usually, a hand -coffee coffee and a dessert. There are low NT $ 300 of holidays, and 90 minutes in a limited time. If no one else is waiting, you can continue to sit. It only reminds 90 minutes at a time.
Hand -punch coffee is packed in a thermal insulation, and it tastes on the taste level. Because of the material of the thermos bottle, the coffee will taste a little bit. It is recommended to drink a little faster.
If you haven't eaten the hot iron pot, it is recommended to order once. The skin is grilled crispy. The skin inside is soft and tender. There are two balls of ice cream, rice incense and all kinds of fruits.
In addition to the original flavor, Sikang can also choose a flavor. Sikang is crispy, loose inside, and moderate sweetness. It is a good choice with coffee.
Basque cheese cake is not much different from ordinary cheese cheese cake.
This is a good place to look at the sea and drink afternoon tea."
"小卷真的挺嫩也挺好吃，
服務人員非常非常細心介紹每一個菜單上的品項，

沒有附設停車場，可以往前約100公尺停到路邊停車格，走路不遠。","The beautiful cafe, the camping style is very suitable for the scenery of the north coast, the desserts are delicious, and the coffee and bubble drinks are delicious.

"鬆餅很脆搭配上冰淇淋是神來一筆
缺點是融化的很快
溫泉蛋拌麵整體的味道加上辣醬味道平衡很香
味道體驗上像是白醬麵
整體的體驗下來是好的
只是價格偏高 台北的價格 收服務費","The muffin is crispy with ice cream is a god
The disadvantage is that it melted quickly
The overall taste of hot spring egg mixing noodles plus spicy sauce flavor is very fragrant
The taste experience looks like white sauce noodles
The overall experience is good
It's just that the price is high in Taipei."
原本還想說價格偏高，但食物上桌後覺得還行～用料實在！小卷好吃！,"Originally I wanted to say that the price was high, but the food was okay after the food was on the table ~ the ingredients were real!The small roll is delicious!"
"露營風格的店面，一樓旁有設置outdoor及文青精品區可以購買，二樓是用餐區簡約的木製輕風格，餐飲個人覺得走戶外露營的感覺，餐盤裝著一套餐整體小巧又精緻，堅果半熟蛋烏龍麵很不錯吃旁邊主菜是鹹小卷味道偏重，XO醬配合堅果分明的醬一起混合半熟蛋真的很香濃滑順；咖喱雞肉烏龍麵份量蠻夠的裡面都是真材實料半個馬鈴薯還有大塊胡蘿蔔增加湯頭甜度，雞肉先塗醬料煎至金黃酥脆再放置咖哩湯頭內，湯頭偏稀不會膩；飲料也很用心海鹽棉花糖奶茶還用不鏽鋼保溫瓶裝著怕冷掉，鳳梨芒果百里香氣泡飲還用真的大塊鳳梨切片插在飲料中可以食用，果肉甜脆中和堅果烏龍麵在嘴中的味覺，整體很推
還有一個造型特別的甜點：熱鍋徳式鬆餅，外觀很像一個碗邊緣都很脆類似法國麵包的硬度敲擊起來還有聲音，內部裝有新鮮現切水果跟冰淇淋非常好吃，但是到最後熱鍋的熱度會迅速融化冰淇淋會有點慘不忍睹的樣子，不過整體我給他四顆星！
Tips:雖然門口有寫寵物禁止，但是有寵物包包就可以帶入店內，店員也都蠻有耐心","The camping style store can be purchased on the first floor. Outdoor and Wenqing boutique areas can be purchased. The second floor is a simple wooden light style in the dining area. The catering personally feels like the outdoor camping. Nutsm and cooked egg oolong noodles are very good to eat the main dishes next to the side dishes are salty and small rolls. The XO sauce with the nuts of nuts with the nuts mixing the half -cooked eggs is really fragrant and smooth; Real materials are half potatoes and large pieces of carrots to increase the sweetness of the soup. The chicken first coated sauce and fried until golden and crispy and then placed in the curry soup. The soup is thin and not greasy. The insulation bottle is afraid of cold, pineapple mango Baili aroma soaking drinks are really large pieces of pineapple slices and inserted in the drink to eat.
There is also a special dessert with special shapes: hot pot -style muffins, the appearance is very crispy like a bowl edge, similar to the hardness of French bread. In the end, the heat of the hot pot will quickly melt ice cream. It will be a bit terrible, but I give him four stars as a whole!
Tips: Although there are pets at the door, there are pet bags to bring them into the store, and the clerk is quite patient."
"店員很親切！
十一點多到的時候位置還滿多的，過一陣子就滿了，大家可以提早來。
原本以為餐飲應該就和大部分的咖啡廳一樣中規中矩，主打的是海邊的風景。沒想到一上桌真的被驚艷到，用心得不得了！
忘記當天點的飲料的品名，但有1/4塊大鳳梨直接放在杯子裡，真的是好看又好喝。
一樓的選物部分也很好逛，推推❤️","The clerk is very kind!
At eleven o'clock, there is still a lot of location, and it will be full for a while. You can come early.
Originally thought that the catering should be as satisfactory as most of the cafe, the main thing is the landscape of the beach.I didn't expect to be stunned at the table, and I was so hearty!
Forgot the name of the drink that day, but 1/4 of the large pineapple is placed directly in the cup, which is really beautiful and delicious.
The selection part on the first floor is also very easy to stroll, push ❤️"
建議早一點到場，餐點好吃空間舒適，服務非常的好。推薦。,"It is recommended to arrive earlier, the meal is delicious and comfortable, and the service is very good.recommend."
每一道都很好吃好😋不是網美店、服務人員很親切 ，份量有夠、新鮮現做、上菜不會等很久～吃飽散步一下離海邊一下下,"Everything is delicious. 是 Not the net beauty shop and the service staff are very kind. The portion is enough, fresh and fresh, and will not wait for a long time ~ eat and take a walk."
"每人低消300元，服務費另加8%
低消已經不是一杯飲料的時代
熱鐵鍋德式鬆餅，必推","Each person eliminates 300 yuan, and the service fee plus 8%
Low elimination is no longer a cup of drink

"平日午後 人潮不少 稍吵
若按靜音 應該是個舒適的休息地方
放放鬆吃吃甜點 會很讚
甜點口味意料內 不驚豔但也不雷","There are a lot of noisy people in the afternoon
If you press silent, it should be a comfortable rest place
It will be great if you relax and eat desserts
Dessert taste is not amazing but not thunderous"
料理方式及食材鮮度都很不錯，整體室內空間及音樂都能讓人完全放鬆，室外則可直接看到海景。點餐時店員會特別說明餐點特色，若想吃飽的話，推薦可點烏龍麵。吃過咖哩及昆布高湯，都別有一番滋味。,"The cooking method and the freshness of the ingredients are very good. The overall indoor space and music can completely relax, and the outdoor can see the sea view directly.When ordering, the shop staff will specifically explain the characteristics of the meal. If you want to eat, it is recommended to order oolong noodles.Have eaten curry and Kunbu soup, don't have a taste."
"每樣餐點都好大一份而且用料實在，連蔬菜都切得超大塊，吃完飽足感🈵️🈵️🈵️唯獨湯咖哩有點太油，之後會想試試乾拌系列，然後烏龍麵條如果可以換成讚岐烏龍麵口感應該會更好🤣默默許願…

甜點類點的是紅茶烏龍乳酪蛋糕，不會太甜，茶香奶香都很濃，真材實料，配茶很對味，煎餅也好好吃～

這家店從店名、用餐環境到餐點餐具都很有自己獨特的風格，有室內也有戶外區，氛圍都很棒，重點是看得到海，要聚餐、約會或是度過親子時光都滿適合的，可以體會什麼是真正的生活跟過日子～","Every meal is so big and the ingredients are real. Even the vegetables are cut out of large, and the fullness of fullness 🈵️🈵️🈵️ Only the soup curry is a bit too oily. If the noodles can be replaced with Zanqi oolong noodles, it should be better in silence ...

The desserts are the black tea oolong cheese cake, which will not be too sweet. The tea fragrance milk is very strong, the real ingredients are real, and the tea with tea is very delicious.

This store has its own unique style from the name of the store and the dining environment. There are indoor and outdoor areas. The atmosphere is great. The point is to see the sea. Yes, you can realize what is the real life and live a life ~"
難得平日啦！環境乾淨！餐點雞腿烏龍好吃！肉不材，多汁！鬆餅跳脫我想像中的型態，特別不難吃❤️,"Rare on weekdays!The environment is clean!Meal some chicken legs oolong!The meat is not expected, juicy!The muffin jumps away from the type I imagined, it is not difficult to eat ❤️"
"好吃， 餐點的食材非常用心且新鮮
老闆人很親切👍👍👍下次會在來用餐的😋😋😋","It's delicious, the ingredients of the meal are very careful and fresh
The boss is very kind."

☎️只提供現場候位，不可訂位。

👉店內有印章可以蓋～滿有心的

餐點感想：餐點不多，現點現做，出餐不快蛋還可以接受。

🔹魚香奶醬 溫泉拌烏龍麵：選了「嫩煎小卷」，小捲很好吃像是烤過得，吃起來沒有腥味。乾拌麵有附紫菜湯，湯頭有合格。醃蘿蔔不會太酸，味道不錯。烏龍麵的溫泉蛋與奶醬給很多，配菜有：蕃茄、柴魚片、玉米筍、糯米椒等等。

🔹鹹甜乳酪：有肉鬆跟鹹蛋黃，意外很搭耶，蛋糕也很香濃！

🔹金山紫心地瓜牛奶：超級讚的飲料，滿滿的料！不會太甜，雖然奶味喝起來一般，但地瓜香氣有出來，還加了地瓜酥幾片與地瓜塊一小塊。底下滿滿的地瓜泥要攪拌均勻，比較好喝喔～

👉有戶外空間，一樓與三樓可以出去走走拍照，有做一些佈置。晚上打燈應該滿有氣氛～

（感覺我們運氣不錯，都點到不錯吃的。看到其他人點的「漂亮」飲料，都喝不到一半...懷疑口味不適）

同一天去了其他咖啡廳，這家算是貴得值得了…真的是比較出來的

其他的都很不錯
餐點好吃，服務親切","Except that the air conditioner is a bit hot, follow the parking lot without your own

"說真的，餐點也不能說沒有誠意，其實配料滿豐富的，感覺也盡力在給料了，但很多食材搭配起來口感或口味無法取得和諧，滿可惜的。

烏龍麵的麵條是最失敗的，口感非常差，以致於我和朋友都沒辦法吃完那些麵條，湯頭淡薄無深度，我個人口味是屬於清淡類型的，但這個湯喝一喝甚至會讓人感覺有點空虛。不過硬要說的話，湯很淡也不是不能接受，但強烈建議麵條一定要換。

巴斯克蛋糕是當天最好吃的餐點。

鑄鐵鍋的鬆餅，熱熱的很好吃，但敗筆是那二塊米香，因為熱鬆餅讓冰淇淋融化得非常快，米香一碰到溶化的冰，口感就變得爛糊。其中蘋果的部分則是雖然它很鮮脆，但由於口感跟其他食材差異太大，非常不和諧，建議蘋果可以先煎軟，做成焦糖蘋果，然後把米香分開放，應該會加分不少。

磅蛋糕則是當天用餐體驗中的災難，太濕、不好吃，連拍照都不好看。既然不是店家製作的產品，建議要對售出的商品稍做把關。

由於是特地騎了二小時機車過去用餐，餐點的體驗的確是讓人感到稍稍失望，不過還是可以感受到店家對環保的用心，店內的氣氛也很舒服，如果有機會再去，希望可以吃到進化後的餐點。","Seriously, the meal cannot be said to have no sincerity. In fact, the ingredients are full of ingredients, and they feel that they are trying to give it, but it is a pity that many ingredients have the taste or taste that cannot be harmonized.

The noodles of the oolong noodles are the most failed, and the taste is very poor, so that neither I and my friends can finish eating those noodles. The soup head is thin and depth. My personality belongs to a light type, but this soup will even make people even make people people even make people make people. It feels a bit empty.However, if you want to say it, it is not unacceptable to the soup, but it is strongly recommended that the noodles must be changed.

Basque cake is the best meal that day.

The muffin of the cast iron pot is very delicious, but the defeat is the two pieces of rice incense, because the hot muffins make the ice cream melt very quickly. As soon as the rice fragrant encounters the melted ice, the taste becomes messy.Among them, the part of the Apple is that although it is very crispy, because the taste is too different from other ingredients, it is very discordant. It is recommended that apples can be fry first, make caramel apples, and then open rice fragrance. few.

The pound cake is the disaster in the dining experience that day. It is too wet and not delicious. Even taking pictures is not good -looking.Since it is not a product made by the store, it is recommended to check the selling products slightly.

Since the two -hour dining for two hours, the meal experience is indeed a little disappointed, but you can still feel the intention of the store's environmental protection, and the atmosphere in the store is also very comfortable. If you have the opportunity to go again, you hope to eat it. To the evolution meal."
主食烏龍麵的小卷很大隻很鮮甜，咖啡有驚豔到，有茉莉花香味，不澀微酸,"The small rolls of the staple food oolong noodles are very large and sweet, coffee is amazing, there is jasmine flavor, not astringent sour"
"第三次到訪，之前都沒有點過鬆餅，這家鬆餅比較特別，像酥皮的感覺，不過我自己口味不太喜歡鬆餅裡面的冰淇淋融化，把鬆餅泡的爛爛的口感，所以沒有吃完。
這邊低消每人三百，覺得價格偏高了一點，不過乳酪蛋糕跟黑咖啡配起來很好！
PS這邊沒有拿鐵咖啡，都是單品美式咖啡。
我是小孩子口味，喜歡拿鐵 🙃","The third visit, I haven't ordered muffins before. This muffin is more special, like a messenger, but my own taste does not like the ice cream in the muffin melted, and the rotten taste of the pine bakery bubbles So I didn't finish it.
There are three hundred per person here, and the price is a bit higher, but the cheese cake is well matched with black coffee!
There are no latte coffee on the PS side.

烏龍麵很Q彈，醬汁很香濃，扒附醬汁相當美味，口感帶點微辣卻又圓潤的口感，小卷很鮮又彈，沾烏龍麵的醬汁一起吃超搭，滿滿的鮮甜口感，咖啡不會太酸或太苦，不錯喝，用餐環境很棒，就海岸旁，用餐的體驗很舒服,"The oolong noodles are very Q bombs, the sauce is very fragrant, the sauce is very delicious, the taste is slightly spicy but rounded, the small roll is very fresh and bombarded, and the sauce with the oolong noodles is eaten together.

"北海岸可愛又好吃的咖啡店！

價錢有點網美，但悠閒的氛圍跟好吃的食物會讓人心甘情願。乾拌的椒麻烏龍麵很好吃，椒麻醬很香，也不會太辣；小卷很新鮮。鐵鍋鬆餅很厲害，帶有濃郁的蜂蜜香氣卻不會太甜，配上冰淇淋很棒。鳳梨芒果百香果氣泡飲好喝，雖然一開始有被1/4的鳳梨嚇到

"整體環境佳，有戶外頂樓座位區及帳篷營火區，裝潢擺設偏向工業風及露營風，且距離中角灣沙灘很近，適合夏秋季天氣好時來坐坐。
餐點點了紅心烏龍口味的巴斯克乳酪蛋糕，及北潮撫石的單品手沖。紅心烏龍的巴斯克有令人驚艷，推薦嘗試！手沖部分品質穩定，也符合菜單中敘述的風味，蠻好喝的。
惟該店需另外負擔8%清潔費，似為針對店家場地維護(店內及店外戶外區蠻適合拍照打卡)，故另外收取清潔費。","The overall environment is good. There are outdoor top -floor seats and tent camp fire areas. The decoration is biased towards the industrial style and camping style, and it is very close to the Mid -Kokwan Beach. It is suitable for sitting when the weather is good in summer and autumn.
The Basque cheese cake with red heart oolong flavored, and the hand -made items of Beichao Fushi.The Basque of the Red Heart Oolong is amazing, it is recommended to try!The stable quality of the hand rushing is also in line with the flavor described in the menu, which is quite delicious.
However, the store needs to bear another 8%cleaning fee, which seems to be maintained for the store's venue (the inside and outdoor areas inside and outdoor areas in the store are suitable for taking pictures and punching cards), so another cleaning fee is charged."

裝潢設計很有店主的想法和風格，二樓是室內用餐區，還特別有個類露營棧板小空間😄三樓是戶外陽台用餐區，眺望中角灣美景👍一樓選物區有許多與「海洋」相關的實用品項。
餐飲也有亮點，這次只點了飲料甜點，有根新鮮鳳梨的氣泡飲果然好喝又好吃😋推。有偷瞄到隔壁桌的小管烏龍麵，有吸引到下次來試試😁","The store name is very interesting. It is indeed ""lived in the north"" in the North Coast to open a shop.

"夏天的窗台是熱門的位子，有大片的落地窗，踏出去的木棧板能看到不遠處的沙灘，店家附上可愛的小望遠鏡，讓我們在舒適的樹蔭下也能一窺海的樣貌。

店面舒適有三層樓，餐點比預期的美味許多，調味適當、德腸的焦香非常好吃！

是北海岸最喜歡的咖啡廳","The window sill of summer is a popular seat, with large floor -to -ceiling windows. The wooden stack boards that are stepped out can see the beach not far away. Look.

The store is comfortable with three floors, and the meal is much more delicious than expected. The sprinkled flavor with appropriate seasoning and the intestines is very delicious!

It is the favorite cafe in the North Coast"
"位於北海岸的一個複合式餐飲店。店名「靠北過日子」中的「靠北」貼切地說明了店家位置，距離台灣本島最北點的富貴角只有15公里，不過，「過日子」我想才這家店真正的重點。以一個海岸咖啡店來說Q B Days的內部裝潢相對樸實，從室內座席望出去的海景也還好，但或許Q B Days從一開始的訴求就不是這些而是和店家理念結合的一種「生活感」。這生活感在店裡處處可見，包括一樓的像是雜貨店的販賣空間(品項以露營等戶外生活為主)，二樓的室內的營帳設計，以及我最喜歡的那還有著營火的海邊營地，看著那片可坐享海灣美景的營地，似乎可以想像店家自己在北海岸的這個角落「生活」的情景。店外空間其他有生活感的部份還包括一個樹蔭下一樣可以遠眺遠方海面的板凳、屋頂的空間等等。只能說，Q B Days真的是處處都有一種生活的氣息，這也是我最喜歡它的地方。

目前內用的餐飲低銷金額較高，單人用餐只單點一杯飲料肯定不夠而必須搭配其他像是點心蛋糕等等，若多人一起用餐分擔下來或許會更划算，不過，我想要在北海岸這個很多時候都頗為艱苦的地方「生活」總需要經濟來源(畢竟不是去捕魚或種瓜)，所以若認同其理念、喜歡這個氛圍還是值得支持一下。這次所點的所有品項包括巴斯克蛋糕和薄荷檸檬也都不錯是額外加分。

“Quiet B. Days”中的”quiet”意思比較明確，那麼”B.”意指什麼？除了可以是Bay外，我在店內販賣區看到一個上頭標了b stands for beautiful的pin buckle，對我來說這個詮釋更適合。

可以一訪","A composite restaurant located on the North Coast.The store name ""Live on the North"" ""north"" explains the location of the store, which is only 15 kilometers away from the wealthy corner of the northernmost point of Taiwan.For a coastal coffee shop, the interior decoration of Q B Days is relatively simple, and the sea view from the indoor seat is also okay, but maybe Q B Days from the beginning is not these but a ""sense of life combined with the store concept. """".This sense of life can be seen everywhere in the store, including the trafficking space like grocery stores on the first floor (mainly outdoor life such as camping), the indoor accounting design on the second floor, and my favorite. Sea camps, watching the camp that can enjoy the beauty of the bay, it seems that you can imagine the ""life"" scene of the store himself on the corner of the North Coast.Other living parts outside the store also include a bench, roof space, and so on.It can only be said that Q B DAYS really has a breath of life everywhere, which is also my favorite place.

At present, the low sales of catering internally are relatively high. Only one cup of drinks for single meals must be not enough, and it must be paired with other snack cakes. It may be more cost -effective if many people eat together. This is often a difficult place for ""life"" in the North Coast. ""Life"" always requires economic sources (after all, not fishing or planting melons), so if you agree with its concept and like this atmosphere, it is worth supporting.All the items at the point this time include Basque cake and mint lemon are also good.

""Quiet"" in ""Quiet B. Days"" means clearly, so ""B."" does ""B."" mean?In addition to Bay, I saw a Pin Buckle marked with B Stands for Beautiful in the store in the store, which is more suitable for me.

"今天點了麵包德腸佐堅果沙拉和鐵鍋鬆餅（泰奶冰淇淋）。

堅果沙拉醬好吃。推薦！
德腸大約只有大拇哥長度。
這一次附上的起司野菇麵包體太鹹不合我口味，捨棄它沒吃完。

鐵鍋鬆餅裡頭放了三種水果、兩塊米香和兩球冰淇淋。
水果當令，所以好吃。
米香一為原味、一為焦糖。但是不夠酥脆，在口中無法爽快的咬碎、又黏牙，所以跟冰淇淋的口感不搭。焦糖+冰淇淋又太甜，所以也被我捨棄不吃。

重點的鬆餅：
利用鬆餅作為承裝容器的發想非常好，但是就得吃掉大部分的內容物後，才能開始吃鬆餅。（看看別人評論裡附的照片就知道我在說什麼）
我想吃的是鬆餅，不是水果和冰淇淋，更不是米香。

但，我想沒人能在兩球冰淇淋融化前就吃完它，然後得到一碗乾爽的鬆餅。
所以我吃到的大部分的鬆餅體，入口時都是浸濕在冰淇淋醬裡的軟綿（爛）口感，鬆餅的味道也多會取決於你所挑選的冰淇淋，今天選的泰奶口味太甜，很容易膩。錯的是泰奶冰淇淋。

如果把一球冰淇淋用日式昭和布丁（比較硬 、蛋味重的那一種）來替換，是否會好些？

如果我下一次再來，我還是會點鐵鍋鬆餅。但是我會要求鬆餅碗裏不要放東西，把那些內容物另外裝給我。若店家不幫我這麼作，我就放棄這鬆餅。","Today I ordered the bread deed sausage salad and iron pot muffin (Thai milk ice cream).

Nut salad sauce is delicious.recommend!
There is only about the length of the thumb.
This time the cheese mushroom bread is too salty and disagreed with my taste.

There are three kinds of fruits, two rice incense and two -ball ice cream in the iron pot muffins.
Fruits should be ordered, so it is delicious.
Mi Xiang is original and one is caramel.But it is not crispy enough, and it can't be bitten and sticky in the mouth, so it does not match the taste of ice cream.Caramel+ice cream is too sweet, so I am abandoned or not.

The key muffins:
It is very good to use muffins as a container, but you have to eat most of the contents before you can start eating muffins.(Look at the photos attached to someone else's comments and know what I'm talking about)
I want to eat muffins, not fruits and ice cream, nor rice fragrant.

However, I think no one can eat it before the two -ball ice cream melts, and then get a bowl of dry muffins.
So most of the muffins I have eaten, the soft (rotten) taste soaked in the ice cream sauce at the entrance, and the taste of the muffin depends on the ice cream you selected. The taste is too sweet and easy to get tired.The wrong one is Thai milk ice cream.

If a ball ice cream is replaced with a Japanese -style Showa pudding (the one with a hard and heavy egg flavor), will it be better?

If I come again next time, I will still order iron pot muffins.But I will ask the muffin bowl not to put things and install those contents to me separately.If the shop does not help me, I will give up this pine cake."
大推魷魚咖哩烏龍麵、草莓氣泡飲，店內為outdoor風，外有露台可瞭望海邊衝浪的人們，很不錯的地方。,"The big push squid curry oolong noodles, strawberry air bubbles, the store is Outdoor style, and there are people who can look at the sea surfing outside. It is very good."
"疫情期間店內不開冷氣，靠窗的座位會有海風吹拂，店內也備有電風扇，但是怕熱的朋友需三思。
用餐時間限時100分鐘，即使在店內未客滿的狀態下也無法延長時間，所以個人覺得並不適合三五好友聊天聚餐。
餐點部份～
魚香奶醬溫泉蛋乾拌麵：將整個溫泉蛋攪和至烏龍麵裡之後其實沒什麼蛋味，奶味也不會太濃稠，因此即使冷掉也不會太膩口。菜單寫小辣，個人覺得沒什麼辣度，屬於清爽口感的乾拌麵。就連附的海帶芽竹輪湯也很清淡。不過主菜雞腿就醃的很入味了。
小卷咖哩濃湯烏龍麵：有兩隻蠻大的小卷，配料也頗多，只是湯頭偏油，比較偏重口味，且蠻辣的（個人覺得中辣），但菜單上並未表示，如果完全不吃辣的朋友需考慮。另外搭配店家自製的柚子醃蘿蔔，可去油解膩。
明治牛奶冰棒奶茶：已經點了少冰，將冰塊撈出來後奶茶只剩半杯多一點點，而且冰棒都還泡在裡面，喝起來也很清淡，CP值很低。相較之下氣泡飲還稍微好一些，至少味道夠，只是必須趕快喝完，不然久了沒氣泡一樣.....
熱鐵鍋鬆餅：就是嚐鮮嘍～不是普通的格子鬆餅，反而是將鬆餅做成容器盛裝其他食物，上半部口感較酥，底部類似法式吐司，店員介紹可將鬆餅沾冰淇淋吃，但個人覺得分開吃還比較好，而且最好先把冰淇淋吃完，免得其他食物被泡軟，口感變差。另外鬆餅內的蘋果，完全沒甜也沒蘋果香氣。","During the epidemic, there will be no air -conditioning in the store, the seats of the window will be blown by the sea breeze, and the store is also equipped with an electric fan, but friends who are afraid of heat need to think twice.
The time limit for meals is 100 minutes. Even if it is not full in the store, it cannot be extended, so I personally feel that it is not suitable for three or five friends to chat and dinner.
Meal part ~
Switzer -saving hot spring eggs: Stir the entire hot spring egg until the oolong noodles actually have no egg flavor, and the milk flavor will not be too thick, so even if it is cold, it will not be too greasy.The menu is small, and I personally feel that there is no spicy degree, it is a dry noodle with a refreshing taste.Even the supplementary kelp bud bamboo wheel soup is very light.However, the main vegetable chicken legs are marinated.
Small rolls of curry soup oolong noodles: There are two small rolls of small rolls, and there are many ingredients, but the soup is oily, which is more important, and it is quite spicy. If you don't eat spicy friends at all, you need to consider it.In addition, it can be matched with the homemade grapefruit pickled radish, which can remove the greasy greasy.
Meiji milk popsicle milk tea: You have ordered less ice. After the ice cubes are removed, there are only half a little more milk tea, and the popsicles are still soaked in it.In contrast, the bubble drink is slightly better, at least the taste is enough, but it must be drank quickly, otherwise there is no bubbles for a long time ...
Hot Iron Pot Slim: It's early adopters ~ not ordinary plaid muffins, but instead make muffins into containers to dress other foods. The upper part of the texture is crispy, the bottom is similar to French toast. It is better to eat it, but I personally feel that it is better to eat it separately, and it is best to finish the ice cream first, so as not to be softened by other foods, and the taste is worse.In addition, the apple in the muffin is completely sweet or apple aroma at all."

點了蠻多人推的鐵鍋鬆餅，但裡面水果、米果跟冰淇淋鬆餅根本不搭，只有長得好看，冰淇淋因為鐵鍋蠻燙很快就融化，泡的底部鬆餅爛爛的。

I ordered a lot of people to push the iron pot muffins, but the fruits, rice fruit and ice cream muffins are not matched at all, only look good, ice cream melted quickly because the iron pot is quite hot, and the bottom of the muffin at the bottom of the soak is rotten. Essence

In particular, my teppanyaki cakes make my eyes bright. I think it is an ordinary grid. Muffins, but not!Then you are wrong. The waiter smells the smell of fragrant fragrance from a distance. The soul ice cream of the muffin is too delicious!The small roll of curry oolong noodles, the chicken leg curry oolong noodles are limited, and the wife is really ecstasy!In order to keep the original flavor in the thermos cup, coffee can taste it carefully.

"店員服務很好，附近有公用停車場，建議現在中角灣公園停好車，在前往排隊就好，我們去大概2點多，不太需要等就有位置，店內採半自助式，要自己拿餐具跟水，1樓有買很多小東西，等待的時候還能逛逛。
鍋燒鬆餅真的必點，跟一般鬆餅不一樣，他們是水果加上2種口味冰淇淋，配上烤的脆脆的鬆餅，口感真的很不錯，愛喝咖啡的不能錯過他們的單品咖啡，用保溫瓶上桌，有一個小杯子能喝到溫度穩定，又有咖啡香味的好咖啡。另一個特別就是磅蛋糕，都是有酒香的口味，但入口沒有什麼酒味。","The clerk's service is very good. There is a public parking lot nearby. It is recommended that the Zhongjiao Bay Park is now in a good car. Just go to line up. We go to about 2 o'clock. If you do n’t need to wait, there is a place. Take the tableware and water, buy a lot of small things on the first floor, and you can go shopping when you wait.

"本來只是想找個景觀餐廳耍廢，沒想到發現了一個寶藏店家～ 很少會有景觀餐廳的餐點用心到我想推薦給其他人，就連小菜都很驚艷！

😋果仁醬拌洋蔥真的是大愛，讓我忍不住買了一罐回家！
🍜烏龍麵主題很Q彈，搭配的培根是很厚的那種，絕對飽足感滿滿！
🥤雖然大部分的人都點水果系飲料，但我真的很推地瓜牛奶，金山的地瓜真的太太太好吃了，喝完它真的會想買地瓜回家DIY！
📷再來是風景的部分，雖然我們去玩的那天很熱，但陽台後的風景好得沒話說，超級好拍！趴在欄杆上看海真的不要太美好！

一定一定一定會再回去（畢竟可以看風景欣賞腹肌誰不喜歡呢～）","Originally, I just wanted to find a landscape restaurant to play abandoned. I did not expect to find a treasure shop ~ I rarely have the meal at the landscape restaurant to the heart. I want to recommend it to others, even the side dishes are amazing!

I really love the fruits and onions, so I couldn't help but buy a can home!
很 题 题 🍜 🍜 Theme is very Q bombs. The bacon is very thick, and it is absolutely full!
Although most people order fruit drinks, I really push sweet potato milk. The sweet potato in Jinshan is really delicious. After drinking it, I really want to buy sweet potatoes home DIY!
部分 Come again is the landscape part. Although the day we went to play very hot, the scenery behind the balcony was so good that it was super good!Lying on the railing to see the Hai really don't be too beautiful!

I will definitely go back again (after all, you can watch the scenery and appreciate the abdominal muscles, who don’t like it ~)"
"好喜歡整間餐廳的氛圍，座位、燈飾還有餐碗都很有露營的感覺，二樓有陽台和階梯，可以直接連到外面看到大海

每道餐點也都很吃，以風景區來說價格合理","I really like the atmosphere of the entire restaurant. The seats, lights, and dining bowls are very camping. On the second floor, there are balconies and stairs. You can directly connect to see the sea directly.

Each meal is also very good, the price is reasonable for the scenic area"
"雖然有開窗 但整間店室內還是悶熱的沒有對流 沒有開冷氣
可能是開放式廚房熱氣一直往上竄？
氣泡飲有打卡的外觀 尚可
有口味的奶茶跟熱可可 都很像粉泡然後加果露 化工味蠻重

三顆星給鬆餅蠻特別的 冰淇淋不錯吃 然後廁所乾淨👌🏻","Although there are open windows, the whole shop is still sultry and there is no confrontation and no air conditioning.
Maybe the hot air of open kitchen has been rushing up?
The appearance of the bubble drink is available
Taste of milk tea and hot cocoa are very much like powder bubbles and then add fruits and chemical flavor.

Three stars are pretty good to eat muffins."
週五平日中秋節連假前出遊萬里，中午第一次造訪靠北過日子，品嚐的是雞肉乾拌烏龍麵跟鳳梨芒果百香果氣泡飲，雞腿份量十足，雞皮表面酥脆，完全沒有任何烤焦的地方，雞肉又很軟嫩，非常好吃，建議可以單吃或是搭配拌勻的醬汁吃，可以享受兩種不同的烤雞風味，醬汁拌勻半熟水波蛋變成滑順的奶黃醬汁，搭配小辣小魚乾醬，讓味道多了點層次，烏龍麵搭配滑順醬汁吃起來非常順口，口味偏清爽，喜歡重口味的人可能會覺得有點淡。氣泡飲料附上新鮮鳳梨果肉，讓人有雙重享受，飲料拌勻後酸與甜的滋味讓這頓午餐劃下完美句點。人均價約500，吃得飽又有海景很值得。,"On Friday, the Mid -Autumn Festival was awarded for thousands of miles before the holiday. The first visit to the north for the first time at noon, I tasted the chicken jerky mixing the oolong noodles and the pineapple mango passion. In the place, the chicken is very soft and delicious. It is recommended to eat it alone or with the mixed sauce. You can enjoy the flavor of two different kinds of roasted chicken. Mix the sauce and half cooked water. The yellow sauce, with a small spicy fish dried sauce, makes the taste a little more layered. The oolong noodles are very smooth with the smooth sauce sauce, and the taste is refreshing. People who like heavy taste may feel a bit light.Bubble drinks are attached to fresh pineapple flesh, which makes people enjoy double enjoyment. The sourness and sweetness of the sourness and sweetness after the beverage mixes the perfect sentence.The per capita price is about 500. It is worth eating and sea view."
寵物友善🐶推薦乾烏龍，雖然我自己點的是湯烏龍🤣就是為了多吃一顆蛋 哈哈 口味偏清淡，份量是女生的份量，男生可能會有點少喔～ 配料很豐富，值得一碗$300。附近可以停在對面的一次一百停車場，或是再往前開兩分鐘的路邊停車。 …,"Pets are friendly 乌 Recommended oolong, although I ordered the soup oolong 🤣 to eat more egg haha, the taste is light, the portion is the amount of girls, boys may be a bit less ~ The ingredients are very rich, it is worth a bowl $ 300.A hundred parking lots can be parked nearby, or a roadside parking on the roadside for two minutes.Mowing"
"隔了很久才來二訪 依舊好喜歡
烏龍湯麵裡的蔬菜好多好好吃
還有很多可愛小物可以購買","After a long time, I still like it. I still like it. I still like it.
The vegetables in Oolong Decoction are so delicious
There are many cute little things to buy"
"很漂亮的網美風格咖啡店。內部是採用露營風格精心設計。我們這次坐的區域就是一個仿露營天幕帳的座位區，搭配上美美的燈泡，氣氛十足。
窗外的景色宜人，喝杯咖啡、吹吹海風，看著窗外的浪一波一波的，不用喝酒也微醺了。
在等待用餐的時候可以到外面走走，這家店外面有一個很漂亮的海邊營地，據說還可以跟店家租借來露營使用，真想試試看在這裡露營。營地旁邊就是美美的海。
這家店的鬆餅非常的特別，是用鐵板烤鬆餅，上面搭配冰淇淋使用，視覺與味覺上都是一種享受。
離開前還逛了一下一樓的販賣部，很多小物都很有質感，讓人很心動。","Very beautiful net beauty coffee shop.The inside is carefully designed with camping style.The area we sit this time is a seat area that imitates the Tianmu Tak of the Own Camp. It is matched with beautiful light bulbs, full of atmosphere.
The scenery outside the window is pleasant. Drink a cup of coffee, blowing the sea breeze, watching waves around the window, and it is slightly stunned without drinking.
You can walk outside when you wait for meals. There is a very beautiful seaside camp outside this shop. It is said that you can also rent it with the store to camping. I really want to try it here.Next to the camp is the sea of ​​beauty.
The muffin of this shop is very special. It is used with iron plate barbecue and used with ice cream. It is a kind of enjoyment in visual and taste.
Before leaving, I also strolled around the trafficking department on the first floor. Many small things were very textured and very exciting."
"好景色配好餐廳😊
放空的好地方

鬆餅好吃","Good scenery with a good restaurant 配
Good place to let go

Pine cake delicious"
"環境很愜意舒服。裝潢打造的如同露營般的旅程，包含器具餐盤都是，點滴都看的出老闆的用心。店員/店長服務極佳。因為店長的細心，將我們有嫩嬰的客人桌原訂戶外區，幫我們協調成內用區。真的很貼心感動。
之前撲空了幾次，今天終於如願成真了。對了，那個乳酪蛋糕/熱茶大推。真心不騙。","The environment is very comfortable.The decoration is like a camping journey, including the dining plates of the appliances, and the boss's intention is to see the boss.The clerk/store manager has excellent service.Because of the carefulness of the store manager, we have the original outdoor area of ​​the guest table of the tender baby, and coordinate us into an internal area.It's really intimate.
I fluttered a few times before, and I finally came true today.By the way, the cheese cake/hot tea push.Really not deceived."
二樓推開落地門 可以走出去面海的平台，好輕鬆自在的氣氛,"Push on the second floor to go out to the platform that can go out of the sea, so relaxed and comfortable atmosphere"
這次餐點點了湯小卷烏龍麵、司康、巴斯克，餐點完全沒有雷，覺得非常符合自己的口味，很喜歡，烏龍麵料多實在又新鮮，司康外酥內柔軟覺得超好吃，如果下次有機會一定會再光顧。,"This time, I ordered the soup small roll of oolong noodles, Sikang, and Basque. The meal was completely without thunder. I felt very in line with their own taste. I like it very much. It's delicious, if you have a chance next time, you will be patronized again."
"就如同名字一樣，這間咖啡店的位置真的遠得很靠北。從台北市區搭1815公車近90分鐘，再步行15分鐘，來到中角灣的藍色咖啡店。

假日幾乎客滿，無法接受事先預約。若不介意炎熱的天氣，店員會安排到三樓戶外區，有遮陽棚和電扇，夏天會悶熱，但這區 view 超好，可以有一望無際的大海。可以請店員留意室內一有位子，就更換到樓下。

餐內只有烏龍麵，4種選擇搭配3種湯頭。280元的價位偏高，但份量十足。點了雞腿奶油烏龍麵，味道很不錯👍 另外還有甜點，但因為假日有限2小時用餐時間，吃太撐就不點甜食。

咖啡的部分沒有 Latte 或 Cappuccino ，執著奶類的朋友可以深思。我點了水洗耶加雪菲，朋友點了店內有名的鳳梨系列氣泡飲，夏天感十足。

店內的設計讓每個角度都值得多拍幾張照片，一樓有販售一些登山戶外用品，喜歡outdoor 的朋友可以逛一逛。當然，吃飽喝足去海邊踏踏浪是很不錯的行程。","Just like the name, the position of this coffee shop is really far from north.It took nearly 90 minutes from Taipei City to a bus for nearly 90 minutes, and walked for 15 minutes to the blue coffee shop in Nakajok Bay.

Holidays are almost full and cannot be approved in advance.If you don't mind hot weather, the staff will arrange to the outdoor area on the third floor. There are sunshine sheds and fan, which will be stuffy in summer, but this area View is super good and can have an endless sea.You can ask the clerk to pay attention to the room in the room and change it downstairs.

There are only oolong noodles in the meal, and 4 choices are paired with 3 soups.The price of 280 yuan is high, but the portion is full.I ordered the chicken leg cream oolong noodles.

The coffee part does not have Latte or CAPPUCCINO, and friends who are obsessed with milk can think deeply.I ordered to wash Yeka Snowfei. My friend ordered the famous pineapple series of bubbles in the shop. It was full of summer.

The design of the store makes each angle worth taking a few more photos. On the first floor, there are some mountaineering outdoor products. Friends who like Outdoor can go shopping.Of course, it is a very good itinerary to eat and go to the beach."
"戶外露營、登山風格超強烈的一家店！
不僅 logo 象徵戶外生活要靠「北」過日子，一樓有戶外生活相關的選品店，餐點用的餐具、杯盤也都是露營專用的，在城市可以體驗一絲絲戶外的悠閒。
手沖咖啡很好喝，會放在保溫杯中保持溫度。
甜點我個人覺得普通，鬆餅跟冰淇淋因為放在一起，放久有點噁心，方便旁邊的米香有特色但個人不愛覺得跟這道甜點沒有很搭。
聽說這家店的鹹食不錯吃，下次可以試試看。","A shop with strong outdoor camping and mountaineering style!
Not only does the logo symbolize outdoor life rely on ""North"" to live, there are selected stores related to outdoor life on the first floor, and the tableware and cup plates used for meals are also specially camped. In the city, you can experience a trace of leisure for outdoor outdoor.
Hand -coffee is delicious and will be kept in the thermal insulation cup.
I personally think that the desserts are ordinary. Because the muffin and ice cream are put together for a long time, it is a bit disgusting. It is convenient for Mi Xiang next to it. I do n’t like it. I do n’t like it.
I heard that the salty food of this shop is good, you can try it next time."
餐點不是普通的烏龍麵跟湯麵，是Q彈，調味也吃的出用心的美味，小捲烤的很新鮮，雞肉也軟嫩，份量很多的，吃的很飽，飲料也很好喝，美中不足是有點熱，但老板有事前說明，也可以接受。餐點設計很像在野餐！下次想要嚐嚐鬆餅,"The meals are not ordinary oolong noodles and soup noodles. They are Q bombs. The seasoning is also delicious. The small rolls are very fresh, the chicken is soft and tender, the portion is full, the food is full, the drink is also delicious, and the drink is delicious. The lack of beauty is a bit hot, but the boss has an ahead of time and can be accepted.The design of the meal is very similar to a picnic!Next time I want to taste the loose cake"
餐點味道中上，烤雞腿的皮很香。鹹甜乳酪蛋糕很特別，搭配肉鬆和紅肉李醬）。,"In the meal, the skin of the grilled chicken leg is very fragrant.The salty sweet cheesecake is very special, with meat pine and red meat Li sauce)."
"111/02/05約中午十二點半在店用餐，進門櫃臺人員很親切的問用餐人數並安排位子，還特別提醒今日未下雨可到外面看看海，左邊有賣一些文創商品（個人是沒去看），到了二樓服務人員很親切的從熱食，甜心，飲料耐心的介紹！（水跟餐具是自取的），上餐速度算快，個人點了「魚香奶醬溫泉蛋拌乾麵（小卷）→麵Q彈奶醬滿香的，小卷很新鮮，整體吃起來奶蛋味塔配的比例不錯（個人覺的）！魚香奶醬溫泉蛋是整個餐點的靈魂（差一點就把剩下的醬汁舔乾淨）！
「金山（原味）加水果雙乳酪蛋糕」（就…一般了點沒啥記憶點）！
「熱紫心地瓜牛奶」附上一小塊紫地瓜（我個人拿去沾乾拌麵的醬了，乾拌麵的醬真的太好吃了），紫心地瓜牛奶是帶有點小小顆粒的，而且是用保溫瓶裝滿貼心的！","111/02/05 dine at the store at about 12:30 noon.

各人喜歡昆布口味的，好好吃～甜點也很好吃，冰咖啡會用保溫瓶裝，他們說這樣才能維持最佳溫度，不過保溫瓶有點難壓……（而且拍照起來不好看😅）不過感覺業主很用心做料理，會想再去 …,"Everyone likes the taste of Kunbu, and it is delicious ~ Dessert is also delicious. Ice coffee will be wrapped in a thermos. They say that this can maintain the best temperature, but the thermos bottle is a bit difficult to press ...

地理位置不太好，沒有停車位。手沖咖啡所以沒有拿鐵，氣泡飲覺得味道有點點淡，烏龍麵不錯吃，服務也是還不錯，但下次如果是要去看海吃東西還是會選擇去淺水灣,"The geographical location is not very good and there is no parking space.Hand coffee so there is no latte, bubble drinks feel a little bit light, the oolong noodles are good, and the service is not bad, but if you want to go to the sea next time, you will choose to go to Qianshui Bay"
餐點非常普通  鹹派很普  鬆餅也很普  唯一好喝的只有咖啡吧…只能說是一間賣氣氛的海景餐廳。清潔費8%到底是清潔了什麼？廁所尿騷味超重，放餐具的地方螞蟻肆虐。唯一的服務大概就上菜，還有收吃完的餐盤。,"The meal is very ordinary, the salty school is very universal and the only delicious food is coffee ... It can only be said that it is a sea -view restaurant with an atmosphere.What is the cleaning fee of 8%cleaning?The toilet's urine flavor is overweight, and the ants are raging in places where tableware.The only service is probably served, and there is a dish that finishes eating."
"用餐時間100分鐘～
店裡充滿露營風格裝潢～
用餐起來非常chill
這次只點了飲料跟鬆餅
鐵鍋鬆餅賣相非常好吃起來口感也是100分！
下次想來嘗試鹹食大推喜歡","100 minutes meals ~
The store is full of camping style decoration ~
The meal is very chill
This time I just ordered a drink and a muffin
The iron pot muffins are very delicious and the taste is 100 points!
Next time I want to try salty food and push like it"
"原以為是熱門網美景點，來了發現整家店是滿滿的戶外魂😍。店面看照片比較大間，本人門面小小的，但整排看起來，靠北滿有特色。像去了很有生活風格的戶外人家裡拜訪一樣。

一樓-點餐區，包含產品寄賣，賣的商品有品牌’蘑菇‘的東西，還有些幽默復古的小物或戶外用品；
二樓-內用區，來的時候看到別人在吃烏龍麵很想吃一碗，可惜吃飽了，最後點了這邊很夯的鳳梨氣泡飲，非常大杯，怕甜可以點檸檬薄荷氣泡飲，看起來很陽春，但是這幾個裡最清爽好喝的。
三樓-海景陽台待一下午配著清爽氣泡飲滿解膩，另外朋友點的明治牛奶冰棒奶茶很適合愛喝奶茶的人喝，香甜還有冰棒吃，很消暑。另外怕冷的朋友點熱飲黑糖桂圓牛奶，很貼心的用保溫杯裝上來，這樣喝到最後還是熱的。

因為一桌平均一人要點到200，飲料大約是180上下，所以我們再點了一個蜂蜜威士忌蘋果磅蛋糕，送上來很小，以為很乾，但吃起來滿濕潤。

東西價格偏高，但因為景很美，店很有自己風格，建議來東北角人不多的時候，可以悠閒一下午。現場還提供望遠鏡。","I thought it was a popular network beauty attraction. I found that the entire shop was full of outdoor souls.The photos on the store are relatively large, and my facade is small, but the whole row looks like it is full of characteristics.It is like visiting the outdoor home with a very life -style style.

On the first floor-ordering area, including product selling, the products selling products include brand 'mushrooms', and some humorous retro small things or outdoor products;
The second floor-internal use area, when I came, I saw others eating a bowl of oolong noodles. Unfortunately, I was full. Finally, I ordered a very rammed pineapple bubble. I ’m very large. I’ m afraid of sweetness. Mint bubbles look very sunny, but these are the most refreshing and delicious.
The third floor-sea view balcony is equipped with refreshing bubbles to drink and decomposes. In addition, Mengzhi milk pops up milk tea, which is made by friends, is very suitable for people who love to drink milk tea. They are sweet and popsicles, which are very summer.In addition, friends who are afraid of cold drink hot sugar cinnamon milk, and use the thermos cup to install it very intimately.

Because the average table of one table is to be 200, the drink is about 180, so we ordered a honey whiskey apple cake, which was very small and thought it was very dry, but it was full of moist.

The price is high, but because the scenery is beautiful, the store has its own style. It is recommended that when there are not many people in the northeast corner, you can leisurely afternoon.The telescope is also available at the scene."
"優點：餐點真的很棒👍香烤雞腿🍗烏龍麵（昆布）東西很新鮮，裡面也好多配料有玉米筍🌽花椰菜🥦杏鮑菇.四季豆.海帶芽.份量對女生來說剛剛好，鬆餅🥞也超好吃的，可惜裡面的我冰淇淋一下就融化了，雖然沒有附設停車場🅿️但旁邊的巷子內有免費停車的公有停車場可停
缺點：夏天真的會熱昏頭，裡面只有2樓座位區有冷氣，但一點都不冷，水和餐具🍴和衛生紙🧻都是自助式的.但也要收服務費7% …","Advantages: The meal is really great 👍 fragrant grilled chicken legs 🍗 乌 noodles (Kunbu) are very fresh, and there are many ingredients with corn bamboo shoots, cauliflower, Pleurotus eryngii. , Muffins are also very delicious, but unfortunately my ice cream melted in it, although there are no parking lots 🅿️, there is a free parking park in the alley next to it to stop
Disadvantages: In summer, there will be hot and faint. There are only air -conditioning in the seat area in the second floor, but it is not cold at all."
來喝下午茶，很好拍，有機會想試試正餐,"Come and drink afternoon tea, it's easy to shoot, I have a chance to try dinner"
"這地方很chill
一樓有賣露營商品
然後三樓以及戶外風景真的滿棒的👍🏻","This place is very chill
There are camping products on the first floor
Then the third floor and outdoor scenery are really great"
"北海岸蠻紅的咖啡店
有兩層樓，還有海景座位
咖啡只有手沖，沒有一般的拿鐵、卡布

餐點的設計是很特別的但口味一般
整體內部的感覺是很棒的
價格蠻高，一個人低消要250
但單點一份到不了，都要點甜點加咖啡
大概要到450一人均消

適合來看海景聊聊天
停車要從前面TF那邊右轉進去公有停車場","Coffee shop with red coffee shop in the North Coast
There are two floors, as well as seascape seats
Coffee has only hand rushing, there is no ordinary latte, Kabu

The design of the meal is very special but the taste is average
The whole interior feels great
The price is quite high, a person is low to eliminate 250
But if you can't get a single copy, you must order desserts and coffee
About 450 per person to eliminate per capita

Suitable to see sea view chat
Turn right from the TF to the public parking lot from the front side of the parking"
"就算是平日也是頗多人特地前來，雖然忙碌但店員態度都親切，帶位入座後也會一一介紹餐點。
手沖單品是用保溫壺裝取，讓客人簡單體驗到露營的樂趣。
喝完咖啡再到戶外小營區還可以拍個照吹個海風放鬆。","Even if there are many people who come here on weekdays, although they are busy, the clerk's attitude is kind, and the meals will be introduced one by one after the seat.
Hand -punching items are packed with a thermal insulation pot, allowing guests to simply experience the fun of camping.
After drinking coffee, you can take a picture of the sea breeze to relax after drinking the coffee."
風景好 用餐環境舒適 餐點美味 老闆帥又親切 by BOOK,"The scenery is good meal environment comfortable meal, delicious boss is handsome and friendly by book"
整體店面很舒服，空間很清幽，食物飲品的部分蠻有特色的，網紅美食，價格偏高，可以來裝文青一下哈哈😅,"The overall storefront is very comfortable, the space is very quiet, the food and drink parts are quite distinctive. Net red food, the price is high, you can pretend to be Wenqing"
"店家前面不方便停車，可以停遠一點的空地再走路過來，佈置很用心，除了餐點之外還有賣餅乾、雜貨，主餐種類比較少一點，價格稍高但可以吃很飽，烏龍麵的菜多、湯頭讚，雞腿和小卷份量也都足夠(小卷非常新鮮，都是當天補撈的)，黃檸檬蛋糕外表樸實口味簡單，蛋糕體偏濕潤，有一點點酸不會過甜
有室內和戶外的座位，店員每個都很親切，可以先看環境再決定坐哪，店員介紹餐點也都很仔細；戶外座位風景很棒，但適合天氣晴朗帶微風的午後，戶外有營地造景適合拍照，可以坐室內用餐後出來散步消化一下，室內也有許多書籍可以消磨時間","It is not convenient to park in front of the store. You can stop the open space and walk over. The layout is very careful. In addition to the meal, there are biscuits and groceries. The main meals are relatively small. There are many noodles and soups, and the amount of chicken legs and small rolls are enough (the small rolls are very fresh, they are all replenished on the same day). The yellow lemon cake is simple and simple. sweet
There are rooms and outdoor seats. Each clerk is very kind. You can see the environment first and then decide where to sit. The clerk's introduction of the meals is also very careful. Scenery is suitable for taking pictures. You can take a walk and take a walk and digest in the room. There are also many books in the room that can spend time"
難得有海景，賣風景的咖啡廳餐點居然如此好吃❤️❤️❤️。不僅餐廳漂亮，餐點cp值很高，甜點鐵鍋德式鬆餅也好吃又特別👍👍👍👍。平日來真是一大享受。 …,"Rare sea views and landscape cafes are so delicious ❤️❤️❤️.Not only is the restaurant beautiful, the CP value of the meal is very high, and the dessert iron pot moral muffin is also delicious and special.It is really a great enjoyment.Mowing"
"一進店就有店員熱情招呼，對我來說覺得是熱情啦！
我喜歡平日造訪這些熱門的店家，悠閒許多！
店裡的小角落裡都有一點小心思
放置餐具的區域，是露營風，喜歡那支樹幹，肯定是海邊撿來的～
翻了一下雜誌都是日文的，看不懂沒辦法看。
點了鹹派跟蛋糕，鹹派比想像小了一些，可能不是能當正餐的份量，但是鹹派整體算蠻好吃的，派的底部酥酥的也很香，沙拉醬也蠻好吃的，有堅果的味道。
飲料的鳳梨是可以拿起來啃的，當天的鳳梨蠻甜的，我們都把它啃光了。
很適合情侶約約會，朋友聚會聊天。
停車可以停在後面的衝浪基地的公有停車場，如果開超過店面就要迴轉喔，但假日應該會不夠停。因為好多人衝浪跟玩水。","As soon as I entered the store, the clerk greeted enthusiastically, and it was enthusiastic for me!
I like to visit these popular stores on weekdays, much leisurely!
There are a little care in the small corner in the shop
The area where the tableware is placed is a camping style. I like that trunk. It must be picked up by the seaside ~
After turning the magazine, it is Japanese.
I ordered the Xianpai and cake. The Xianpai was smaller than I thought. It may not be the amount of meals, but the Xianpai as a whole is quite delicious. The bottom of the faction is crispy. , Taste of Nuts.
The pineapple of the beverage can be picked up. The pineapple of the day was quite sweet, and we all shred it out.
It is very suitable for couples to appointment, friends meet and chat.
Parking can park the public parking lot at the back surfing base.Because many people surf and play with water."
"1.特色店，一樓可以逛逛，外面可以看
2.鬆餅不是傳統格子乾乾的那種，偏濕潤有水果、米香跟冰淇淋，焦糖的很可以
3.鹹食選擇偏少，培根昆布烏龍麵的培根很大片又厚，口味比較清淡，價格稍高
4.派偏軟，一切就會散掉的，菇菇的味道不會太重，附上的香腸好吃，還有附上清爽生菜
5.最滿意是鳳梨氣泡飲
6.有收七趴服務費，假日低消250/人","1. Featured stores, you can stroll on the first floor, you can watch outside
2. The muffin is not the kind of dry grid. It is wet and moist, with fruits, rice incense and ice cream.
3. There are fewer salty food selection. The bacon noodles on Bacon Kunbu Oolong noodles are large and thick. The taste is lighter. The price is slightly higher
4. The faction is soft, everything will be dispersed. The taste of mushrooms will not be too heavy.
5. The most satisfied is the pineapple bubble drink
6. There are seven -party service fee, low holidays 250/person"
環境舒適，老闆很熱情，不知道是不是桌燈的緣故，有點熱。很喜歡咖哩湯烏龍的口味，小卷的香氣很驚艷，但烏龍麵口感偏軟很可惜。鬆餅有脆脆的口感很喜歡，薄荷檸檬氣泡偏甜（甜度不能調整），下次想試試咖啡,"The environment is comfortable, the boss is very enthusiastic. I don't know if it is a table lamp, it is a bit hot.I really like the taste of the curry soup oolong. The aroma of the small roll is amazing, but it is a pity that the ecstasy is soft.The muffin has a crispy texture, I like it, mint lemon bubbles are sweet (sweetness cannot be adjusted), next time I want to try coffee"
網路上查找的店，第一次拜訪果然沒有靠北，店內的陳設頗有自己的味道，除了海邊的商品外還有不少的書及雜誌供大家自取，最值得一提的是鼓勵淨灘做環保換點數，另小後院及頂樓有不少很貼心的小佈置，店員們都能很熱心的解釋，服務態度算水準之上，餐點不多樣，我們點了培根及雞腿的烏龍麵、蘋果派、鳳梨氣泡飲，及耶加雪菲都還算可口的，或許是環境好、服務親切，東西雖簡單但感覺就好！值得再來一次！,"The first visit to the shop on the Internet did not depend on the north. The furnishings in the store have their own taste. In addition to the products on the beach, there are many books and magazines for everyone to pick them up. There are many very intimate small arrangements for environmental protection for environmental protection. In addition, there are many small layouts on the top floor. The clerks can explain very enthusiastic explanations. Noodles, apples, pineapple bubbles, and Jear Snow Fei are still delicious. Perhaps the environment is good and the service is good. Although things are simple, it feels good!It's worthwhile again!"
"飲料餐點有特色，口味不錯，價格也算在合理範圍內。
座位區有分室內與室外，外頭景色不錯，好拍照。
另外店家有販售一些商品，質感上也ok","Drink meals are distinctive, the taste is good, and the price is counted within a reasonable range.
The seat area has indoor and outdoor. The scenery outside is good, good to take pictures.
In addition, the store has some products, and the texture is OK"
"在海邊的一家咖啡廳, 坐下來限2小時用餐, 餐點屬小份量, 建議吃飽再來😅~

服務人員都非常親切有禮貌，餐點也能感受到用心。我的包包細鏈不小心卡在座位上，服務人員（老闆？）非常有耐心的”坐在地上”幫我處理”快30分鐘”吧，全程沒有臭臉跟不耐煩👍🏻（其實店家有提供籃子可放包包喔，所以是我的問題，超不好意思的）這麽好的店家，大推薦☺️ …,"The service staff are very kind and polite, and the meals can feel attentive.My bags are accidentally stuck on the seat, the service staff (boss?)

"停車比較不方便，要去路口的左邊👈轉角處

"如果開車來，可以停在後面（衝浪福利社那邊），有一片鋪滿石頭的空地。

這是第二次來靠北過日子，一樣是坐在露營區，非常放鬆。如果想看海可以去樓上的位置，但應該蠻熱的。

第一次去覺得甜點超級好吃！但這次就沒有特別的感覺了。
飲料跟麵的部分算中規中矩，鬆餅還不錯！

算是這附近很知名的咖啡廳，以價格、食物、地理位置來說，靠北過日子的cp值是高的。","If you drive, you can stop (the surfing welfare agency), there is a vacant area covered with stones.

This is the second time to live in the north, sitting in the camping area, very relaxed.If you want to see the sea, you can go upstairs, but it should be quite hot.

For the first time, I feel that the dessert is super delicious!But there is no special feeling this time.
The part of the drink follows is quite satisfactory, and the muffin is not bad!

It is a well -known coffee shop nearby. In terms of price, food, and geographical location, the CP value of the north is high."
"咖喱培根烏龍麵—培根很大塊，其他配料也有誠意，算是這趟比較好吃的東西
草莓牛奶冰棒氣泡飲、明治牛奶冰棒奶茶—兩杯均普普，吃氣氛的意味大於食物本身，可能比較適合拍照打卡用
野菇鹹派—不行
天氣好的日子候位稍久，看起來像老闆的男生蠻客氣的，即使人多也沒有不耐煩，這點👍
店裡氣氛不錯，適合放空看海","Curry Bacolor Noodles -Bacon is very large, and other ingredients are also sincere.

"非常多細節的一家咖啡店！處處可以看到店家的用心佈置與擺設，很多值得拍照的地方，難怪開幕沒多久整個人潮爆滿。排隊是一定需要，這次因為室內位置要等一小時，所有我們選擇頂樓的位置，有電扇，坐久倒不覺得這麼熱，只是不要選太靠冷氣出風的座位，因為不時會吹出帶有食物味的熱風，如果有時間還是盡量等室內的位置。
手沖咖啡是用STANLEY保溫壺裝著，蠻特別的，在炎熱的天氣下，依然能保持咖啡的冰涼。
威士忌蘋果蛋糕（好像叫這個吧？）帶淡淡的酒味，我是沒有很愛...吃起來有些平凡...
最欣賞這間店除了細節上的用心，處處製造拍照點外，還有樓下有一區展示各國保特瓶，與撿保特瓶送優惠的活動，有機會可以參加看看哦！","A lot of details of a coffee shop!Everywhere you can see the intention of the store, many places worth taking pictures, no wonder the whole crowd is full.It is necessary to queue up.

茶蠻香的，器具看得出來用心。鬆餅有點像舒芙蕾，但外皮是脆的，海鹽口味冰淇淋不錯吃，其他的配料一般～門口沒有位置可以停，可能要停去衝浪中心才行。,"Tea is fragrant, and the appliance can see the intention.The muffin is a bit like Shu Frey, but the outer skin is crispy.

咖啡裝在保溫盃內就知道很重視溫度。
磅蛋糕紮實、濕潤不乾、口感獨特，各有層次。
最厲害的鬆餅在鑄鐵鍋內成一容器，發酵奶油香氣早飄過來，冰淇淋真是太好吃了，米香跟蘋果還有浸過酒的葡萄乾，口味很搭，真是絕配。","When I came today, I had finished meals, prepared to order afternoon tea, and disappeared NT $ 250 per person. I ordered a cup of hand -made coffee, and washed Jigerfei and a honey cake and a muffin.

"基本上餐食就是烏龍麵4種口味做選擇
覺得咖喱還不錯👍🏻 奶油口味有點清淡
但是裡面配料蠻豐富的（鴻禧菇、紅蘿蔔、馬鈴薯玉蜀黍…）
咖啡好喝，建議可以點來喝看看
裝潢很用心！蠻喜歡的
週末記得先訂位，不然要現場等一下","Basically, the meal is the 4 flavors of oolong noodles to choose from
I think curry is pretty good 油 creamy taste is a bit light
But the ingredients are quite rich (Hongxi mushrooms, carrots, potato jade ...)
Coffee is delicious, it is recommended to order to drink and see
The decoration is very careful!Pretty
Remember to book a place on the weekend, otherwise you have to wait on the spot"
烏龍麵本麵普通，但肉、菜用料實在。蘿蔔沒入味。店員很親切，環境舒適。,"The oolong noodles are ordinary, but the meat and vegetables are real.Radish is not tasteless.The clerk is very kind and the environment is comfortable."
"位置一直都坐得滿滿的，很難坐到窗邊的位置😢

The price is slightly higher, but the meal is very cute!The service staff also patiently introduced the menu from the beginning, and the oolong noodles were very fragrant.

店裡面很舒服，讓人感覺很愜意很放鬆，餐具充滿outdoor風格，餐點也很好吃，大推鬆餅跟蛋拌麵，外面有一個小院子天氣好可以去外面看海，開車來可以停在中角灣遊客中心，走路一分鐘👍🏻 …,"The shop is very comfortable, it makes people feel very comfortable and relaxed.

"店家很貼心，最後才上冰淇淋鬆餅（我們點泰奶口味的冰淇淋）因為怕融化，鬆餅口感很特別，鬆鬆軟軟QQ的，吃一份就蠻飽，適合兩人分食，巴斯克蛋糕也很好吃😋不會太甜，加上肉桂醬超搭的！
餐具、衛生紙、水….等都要自己拿取，鹹食也在水準之上，小卷烏龍麵的口感很好，醬料鹹度很ok，小卷咬起來很Q彈，不會像橡皮筋，烤的很香～～唯一美中不足是因為坐在室外（頂樓），很多螞蟻🐜一直跑到盤子上，但是可以看到美美的海～很療癒心情！
一樓還有很多可愛文創商品可以買可以逛，整家店很有自己的風格～","The shop is very intimate, and finally I go to ice cream muffin (we order Thai milk -flavored ice cream) because they are afraid of melting, the muffin has a special taste, loose and soft QQ, and it is quite full to eat one. It is suitable for two people to eat. The cake is also delicious, it will not be too sweet, plus cinnamon sauce!
Table utensils, toilet paper, water ... and so on. They must be taken by themselves. The salty food is also above the standard. The taste of the small roll of oolong noodles is very good. The sauce is very salty. The rubber band is very fragrant ~~ The only disadvantage is because it is sitting outdoors (top floor).

The first itinerary is the net beauty coffee ☕️ shop
Live on the north
Riding to the north is just open to open the door 😎
Some embarrassed Li and Xiaofengfeng are the first group of guests 🥳
The waiter asked us to choose a place casually,
Finally, we chose the location of the window
The wall behind the seat area is a whole row of books.
Put on the wall with a sleeve
It is probably the weather in Jinshan ...
The note in the toilet is very humorous
The boss must be very promoted ️️
1F also has a lot of interesting products related to camping related furnishings

The meal is very fast, and the people and guests come quickly

"服務親切態度很好，食物也好吃！
烏龍麵料多，尤其是小捲真的很新鮮。
點了明治冰棒奶茶，有些黑糖的味道，很香卻不過甜，很推薦！
三樓的位置可以帶狗狗，面對沙灘非常放鬆～","The intimacy of the service is very good, and the food is delicious!
There are many Oolong fabrics, especially the small rolls are really fresh.

"似乎在年假中最冷的那一天選擇去北海岸，還喝了有冰棒在裡面的奶茶，吃了超好吃的烤小捲烏龍麵，好想要有一台頭頂可以燒水的暖爐喔(誤)

食材新鮮又美味，咖啡、茶都很有水準，空間美感、舒適度都非常棒，窗外景色也是一絕，戶外空間乾淨氣氛好，適合可以細細品味經營者巧思的朋友，我給11顆星,The ingredients are fresh and delicious. Coffee and tea are very standard. The beauty and comfort of the space are great. The scenery outside the window is also a must. The outdoor space is good. star
咖喱烏龍麵好吃，可以看海很舒服，低消250/人，超過2000可刷卡。,The curry oolong noodles are delicious. It can be very comfortable to see the sea. It eliminates 250/person. It can swipe the card over 2000.
很喜歡這樣的地方 自己來走走還不錯 環境整理得很好 也有小品牌海洋周邊能購買 小捲好大隻 味道都不錯 後院跟沙灘緊臨 放鬆看衝浪,I really like this place to come and walk well. The environment is well organized. There are small brands. Some small brands can buy small rolls around the ocean.
不知道到底算不算解封後的第一次出遊給了北海岸，而第一次內用就給了位在北海岸的靠北過日子，北海岸不會因為疫情而減少他的魅力，一樣療癒，而靠北過日子的餐點表現依然不俗，咖喱不是到很濃郁到香氣仍足夠，不過該餐點中有非常多大塊的紅蘿蔔，因為本人真的不敢吃大塊紅蘿蔔，有點可惜。甜點的鑄鐵鍋鬆餅也非常好吃，只是因為目前必須分食，此道餐點分完之後賣相差是無所謂，但冰淇淋都融化光了，會影響到口感。桌上皆有隔板。（沒有要怪店家，已經很盡力在做了，但隔板的意義不知道是啥）希望可以撐過這波疫情。💪💪💪 …,"I don't know if the first travel after the unblocking was given to the North Coast, and the first internal use was given to the north on the north coast. Healing, and the meals of the north are still good, the curry is not enough to the aroma, but there are a lot of carrots in the meal, because I really dare not eat large pieces of carrots. It's a pity.The cast iron pot of the dessert is also very delicious, but it is only because it must be eaten at the moment. It does not matter after the meal is finished, but the ice cream melted light, which will affect the taste.There are partitions on the table.(There is no monster shop, I have done my best to do it, but the meaning of the partition does not know what it is) I hope to survive this wave of epidemic.💪💪💪 💪💪💪 ..."
鐵板鬆餅挺特別的Q彈的口感挺棒的，我點海鹽口味不錯不過我覺得我哥點的四季春更好吃，咖啡☕️還行，不過店裡氣氛蠻好的是可以坐一天的地方～,"The iron plate muffin is very special. The taste of the Q bomb is great. I order the sea salt to taste good, but I think the four seasons of my brother are better, coffee ☕️ is okay, but the atmosphere in the store is pretty good. You can sit for a day. Place ~"
"舒服又可愛的店
即使有許多仍須加強的地方
但老闆與店員的熱情和能量足以撐起靠北過日子
假日低消$250/人 服務費10% 蠻高的
飲品約$150-$170 點心約$150-$230

推薦熱鐵鍋德式鬆餅-四季春白蘭地 $230
這是一款屬於大人的鬆餅
帶點焦香的酥脆餅皮（其實蛋香味更是濃郁）
內餡是新鮮的蘋果 奇異果 堅果 果乾
還有一球濃郁茶香的冰淇淋
熱熱酥脆的外皮搭配著冰冰的豐富內餡是幸福的甜點
因鐵鍋非常的燙，所以冰淇淋也融化的特別的快
底層的鬆餅因著熱氣加速吸收了融化的冰淇淋，
如沒有盡快食用完，其實吸滿冰淇淋而軟爛的鬆餅蠻可怕的
（海鹽焦糖的會膩）

黃檸檬蛋糕 $150
類磅蛋糕，比起磅蛋糕，這款蛋糕較為濕潤 清爽，非常濃郁的黃檸檬香氣，以及糖漬的檸檬片（其實個人覺得這片糖漬檸檬太甜了），蛋糕內餡也充滿了檸檬果乾，非常超值真材實料的蛋糕，高CP值

接下來說說飲品部分
特調飲品其實不需要太期待
中規中矩囉.....那整支的鳳梨其實不是很好拍照
不知道是我美感問題還是技術問題
想製作浮誇系飲品的方式其實很多，
但這系列有點....豪邁了！

倒是咖啡（其實我沒點）
下次蠻想嚐嚐看的
因為老闆熱情又專業的介紹給隔壁桌的咖啡感覺很好喝（不知道是老闆的關係還是咖啡真的厲害@@）

可以感覺得出來整間店的風格想要走一個自然 節約能源愛地球🌍
店員們飆著汗做鐵鍋鬆餅真的辛苦💦
開放式廚房的熱氣
24度的冷氣，35度的空間溫度
我站在櫃檯預約就足以飆汗
二樓靠窗的榻榻米位置
其實位置很棒 風景也很棒
但翻桌率超高（因為超熱）
不知道這是賣點還是翻桌策略
電扇應該放置有冷氣的地方往沒冷氣的地方送才合理對吧！（不然熱氣一直送往有冷氣的地方也只是熱風一直吹而已）
眼看著顧客不悅的向店員抱怨⋯⋯其實有許多的方式可以改變（兇什麼兇🐻）

其實最喜歡的是外面的深藍色牆面","A comfortable and cute shop
Even if there are many places that still need to be strengthened
But the enthusiasm and energy of the boss and the clerk are enough to support the life of the north
Holidays low -end $ 250/person service fee is 10% high
Drinks about $ 150-$ 170 dim sum, about $ 150- $ 230

Recommended hot iron pot moral muffin-four seasons Chunbailan $ 230
This is a muffin that belongs to adults
Crispy crust with a bit of scorching (Actually, the fragrance of eggs is even more rich)
The filling is fresh apple kiwi nuts dried fruit fruit
There is also a ball of rich tea fragrance ice cream
The hot and crispy skin with the rich filling of the ice is a dessert of happiness
Because the iron pot is very hot, the ice cream is also melted and very fast
The underlying muffin has absorbed the melted ice cream due to the heat gas,
If you do n’t eat it as soon as possible, in fact, it ’s terrible
(The sea salt caramel will be greasy)

Yellow lemon cake $ 150
Pound cake, compared to pound cakes, this cake is more moist and refreshing, very strong yellow lemon aroma, and sugar -stained lemon slices (in fact, I personally think this sugar lemon is too sweet), the cake filling is full Dry fruit, very good value real ingredients, high CP value

Next, talk about the drink part
Special drinks do not need to expect too much
The whole pineapple is not very good to take pictures
I don't know if it is my aesthetics or a technical problem
There are actually many ways to make exaggerated drinks,
But this series is a bit ....

It's coffee (Actually I don't order it)
I want to try it next time
Because the boss is enthusiastic and professional to the coffee at the table next door, it feels delicious.

You can feel that the style of the whole store wants to go naturally to save energy and love the earth.
The clerks are sweating to make iron pot muffins really hard 💦
The heat of the open kitchen
24 degrees of air -conditioning, 35 degrees of space temperature
I stand at the counter to make an appointment enough to sweat
Tatami position on the second floor
In fact, the position is great and the scenery is also great
But the turnover rate is super high (because of the ultra -heat)
I don't know if this is a selling point or a turning table strategy
The electric fan should be delivered to the place without air -free, right?(Otherwise, the heat has been sent to the place with air -conditioning, it is just the hot air always blows)
Seeing that customers are unhappy to complain to the clerk, there are actually many ways to change (what kind of fierceness)

In fact, the favorite is the dark blue wall surface outside"
地瓜塔和小卷烏龍麵真的很好吃,The sweet potato tower and the small roll oolong noodles are really delicious
"是一間注重設計、經營氛圍、連餐點都有思考過呈現方式、會收7%清潔費的一間不便宜海景咖啡廳。

鬆餅$235很特別也不便宜，但是浸泡在冰淇淋之下，原本酥脆的口感有部分會變成軟爛的滋味。不過四季春冰淇淋還不錯。

鳳梨芒果氣泡飲$175裡面的四分之一顆鳳梨酥不錯吃。

熱薄荷紅玉$180普通，附贈的葉子煎餅還不錯吃。

假日每人低消$250，加上用餐兩小時，7%清潔費，真的是不得了的名店。","It is a cafe that pays attention to the design, operating atmosphere, and even the meal. It is not cheap to show a 7%cleaning fee.

The muffin $ 235 is particularly not cheap, but it is soaked under the ice cream. Some of the crispy taste will become soft and rotten.But the four seasons of spring ice cream are not bad.

Pineapple Mango Bubble Drink $ 175 A quarter of pineapple crisps is good.

Heat mint red jade $ 180 is ordinary, and the leaf pancakes are good.

Holidays have a low of $ 250 per person, plus a meal for two hours, 7%cleaning fee, really an incredible famous shop."
餐點莫名的貴，份量很少，咖啡也很貴一下就喝完了，重點還限時2小時，會準時趕人。這份鹹派一點點，用其他東西點綴要價200元，餐點應該要改成「便利商店式熱狗拼盤」，隔壁的就是網路有人討論的烏龍麵，要價290元，烏龍麵要價290元的概念是看到幾朵花椰菜，接著是主食，的確是一整隻小捲，跟不久前去的基隆餐廳相比，一樣是小捲，餐廳的小捲大很多，該盤料理200出頭也是有配菜生菜等等，小捲縮小加個烏龍麵、幾小朵花耶菜，如果加上店家要收到7%清潔費，超過300元，比台北市知名的烏龍店專賣店還貴！極不推薦！,"The meal is inexplicably expensive, the amount is very small, the coffee is very expensive, and it will be finished. The key will be limited for 2 hours, and it will catch up on time.This salty faction is a little bit, and the asking price is 200 yuan with other things. The meal should be changed to a ""convenient store -style hot dog platter"". The next door is the oolong noodles discussed by the Internet. The price is 290 yuan. Yuan's concept is to see a few broccoli, followed by staple food, indeed a whole small roll. Compared with the Keelung restaurant that came from long, it is a small roll. The small volume of the restaurant is much larger. There are side dishes, lettuce, etc., and small rolls are reduced to add an oolong noodle and a few small flowers. If the store is added, it will receive a 7%cleaning fee, exceeding 300 yuan, which is more than the well -known oolong store specialty store in Taipei. expensive!Very recommended!"

"鳳梨飲料真天熱來一杯真爽快！
小捲鍋燒麵不錯！

但是多數採自助式，喝水餐具也都是要客人自己拿，連點餐客人也要自行下樓，這樣服務費要7%是無法認同的！本身的餐點就已經不便宜了，飲料要175、鍋燒麵要275，裝潢普通，桌椅佈置都屬一般，店家冬天應該沒生意吧，所以夏天多賺一些來補吧！","The pineapple drink is really hot!
Small roll cooker noodles are good!

"以前很常跟前女友來北海岸
但一直沒有機會來喝咖啡

坐著朋友開的車來一探究竟
今天點了台灣包種茶
平常有在喝茶的我，覺得茶味跟茶葉的質
都屬於中上等級
這點就很加分
主食方面點了鹹派跟烏龍麵
原本以為鹹派是比較大塊的部分
但送來是鹹派搭配生菜跟德國香腸
鹹派的香味個人認為還不錯
但用料方面沒有到很紮實
培根烏龍麵超酷
培根兩塊跟控肉一樣大片
湯的部分味道也還算充足
總體可圈可點
加分的部分大概是服務人員每個都很溫柔+親切
但價格也是中上
來這邊喝感覺的我會覺得蠻推的","I used to come to the North Coast with my ex -girlfriend.
But there has been no chance to drink coffee
5/2 The weather is poor
Take a car with a friend to find out to find out
Today I ordered the Taiwan bag breeding tea
I usually drink tea, I think the taste of tea and tea
Both belong to the middle and upper level
This is very extra points
In terms of staple food, I ordered the Xianpai and Oolong noodles
Originally thought that Xianpai was a relatively large part
But it is sent to Xianpai with lettuce and German sausage
The scent of Xianpai personally thinks pretty good
But the materials are not very solid in terms of materials
Bacon oolong noodles super cool
The two pieces of bacon are the same as controlling meat
The taste of the soup is also sufficient

The extra points are probably gentle and kind when the service staff is very gentle+kind

餐點很好吃，大推小卷烏龍麵👍咖啡只有黑咖啡手沖很香很順口，這次有試試店員推薦的飲料好拍好喝（要攪拌均勻🤣） …,The meal is delicious. The big roll of oolong noodles 👍 coffee is only black coffee hand. It is very fragrant.
"⭐️總結：食物中規中矩，整體體驗會讓人再訪。

⭐️食物：
主食部分烏龍麵可以自由搭配。喜歡清淡口味可以吃昆布湯底，但建議不要昆布搭配雞肉，有點不搭。烏龍麵麵體太軟，沒有Q彈的感覺。
甜點煎鍋鬆餅，很漂亮，第一口覺得很特別，一口接一口後聯想到蛋餅。
餐具很可愛。

⭐️體驗：
一樓的店舖非常好逛！有各種潮潮會用的東西，也有室內擴香。
後院很大，也有做佈置，可以在外面看海吸收海邊空氣。
頂樓有戶外區可以坐著吃，但建議在室內就好，室內佈景也很棒且不會有飛蟲或食物冷掉的問題。

⭐️價位：
搭配整體體驗，算合理價位","中️ Summary: Food is quite satisfactory, and the overall experience will make people visit again.

⭐️ Food:
The staple food part of the oolong noodles can be freely matched.If you like light flavor, you can eat the Kunbu soup base, but it is recommended not to match chicken with chicken.Oolong's face is too soft, without the feeling of Q bombs.
Dessert decoction puoming is very beautiful. The first bite feels very special.
The tableware is cute.

⭐️ Experience:
The shop on the first floor is very easy to visit!There are things that can be used in various tide, and indoor expansion.
The backyard is very large, and there are also arranges, which can be seen outside the sea to absorb the sea air.
There are outdoor areas on the top floor to sit and eat, but it is recommended to be indoors. The indoor scenery is also great and there will be no problem of flying insects or food.

⭐️ Price:
With the overall experience, it is considered a reasonable price"
回訪第二次 餐點依然好吃 假日尖峰時段人非常多 但店員沒有因此不耐煩 服務態度還是非常良好（每位店員都是！）推薦大家來！,"The second meal on the return visit is still delicious during the holiday peak period, but the staff is not impatient and the service attitude is still very good (each clerk is!) Recommend everyone!"
海味小卷烏龍麵很夠味，蔬菜烏龍麵味道偏淡。紫地瓜牛奶味道特別可以點來喝看看,"The seafood roll of oolong noodles are delicious, and the taste of the vegetable oolong noodles is light.Purple sweet sweet potato milk tastes special to drink and see"
"在fb追蹤許久，終於有機會拜訪的海邊特色咖啡店。點了熱鍋鬆餅，鹹鹹甜甜的焦糖醬淋在香草冰淇淋上，不會過於甜膩，鬆餅的口感介於QQ和鬆軟之間；手沖的耶加雪菲明亮微酸，用保溫瓶承裝，直到最後也能喝到熱熱的咖啡；另外也點了奶香紅茶，可以回沖一次，戶外小水壺的造型太討喜了。

整間店貫徹outdoor風格，悠閒的氣氛相當令人著迷，店後方可以眺望中角灣，冬天海風有點涼，入夏後會再找機會來拜訪。","For a long time in the FB, the seaside specialty coffee shop finally had the opportunity to visit.Ordered hot pot muffins, salty and sweet caramel sauce drizzled on vanilla ice cream, not too sweet, the taste of muffins is between QQ and soft; It is installed with a thermal bottle until it can also drink hot coffee in the end; in addition, you can also order milk fragrant black tea, which can be built once. The shape of the outdoor kettle is too pleasing.

The whole store implements the Outdoor style, and the leisurely atmosphere is quite fascinating. You can look at the Midoka Bay behind the store. In winter, the sea breeze is a bit cold. After the summer, you will find a chance to visit."

冬天的平常日下雨天來到這間很有味道的海邊咖啡店，人極少。飲品與蛋糕都在水準之上。喜歡店裡放鬆的氛圍，在靠窗位子與好友們耍廢了大半天。,"In winter, it usually comes to this delicious seaside coffee shop, and there are very few people.Drinks and cakes are above the standard.I like the relaxed atmosphere in the store."
一整棟3層樓古宅改建的戶外活動主題文青輕食店～氣氛很悠閒，2樓有陽台區，3樓是戶外用餐區，旁邊就是海攤可以衝浪玩SUP，光是走走聞聞海味也很棒。點了最紅的鳳梨芒果（醬）百里香氣泡飲/（超新鮮烤得超香的）小卷烏龍麵/份量很大還可回沖的金萱茶飲，全部都很滿意。假日限時2小時每人低消250，唯一小缺點可能是停車比較難要找一下。離法股山園區非常近，開車3分鐘。,"A whole 3 -story ancient house reconstruction theme Wenqing light food shop ~ The atmosphere is very leisurely, there is a balcony area on the second floor, the 3rd floor is outdoor dining area, next to the sea stalls can surf the SUP, just walk away and smell it. The smell of smelling Hai is also great.Ordered the hottest pineapple mango (sauce) Baili fragrance drink/(super fresh grilled super fragrant) small roll of oolong noodles/large amount of Jin Xuan tea, all of them are very satisfied.Holidays have a low time to eliminate 250 per person. The only small disadvantage may be that it is difficult to find.It is very close to the Fayang Shanyuan Park, 3 minutes by car."
份量超大 小卷給的很大方，馬鈴薯、紅蘿蔔好大顆🤣，女生根本吃不完，點了厲害的鳳梨🍍氣泡水好喝，坐在要木頭區，靠著枕頭很舒服容易睡著，滿愜意的地方。 …,The large volume is very generous. Potatoes and carrots are so large. Girls can't finish eating. They ordered the powerful pineapple. Full of comfort.Mowing
服務，環境都不錯，咖啡好喝，用保溫瓶裝很有特色，鬆餅也不錯。,"The service, the environment is good, the coffee is delicious, the insulation bottle is very distinctive, and the muffin is good."
樓上景好美，鳳梨氣泡水超好喝，鑄鐵鍋鬆餅味道也很棒！主食只有不同口味的烏龍麵，老闆態度好、也很有sense，雖選擇不多但樣樣精緻，所以就算人多也上菜很快。大推,"The scenery upstairs is so beautiful, the pineapple gas is so good, the cast iron pot muffin tastes great!The staple food only has different flavors of oolong noodles. The boss has a good attitude and is very ance. Although there are not many choices, it is exquisite, so even if there are many people, it will be fast.Push"
香烤雞腿丶海味小卷烏龍麵咖哩好吃，有戶外區可以觀海。,"Fragrant roasted chicken legs, seafood small rolls of oolong noodle curry are delicious, and there are outdoor areas to watch the sea."
"晴天時來過一次
非常推薦天氣好風涼涼的時候選頂樓位子
可以邊吃鬆餅邊看海
還可以拿店家的望遠鏡看衝浪的帥哥","I have been here once on a sunny day
It is very recommended that the weather is good when the wind is cool
You can eat pine cakes and watch the sea
You can also use the handsome telescope to see the handsome guy of surfing"
"二訪，食物真的很好吃，也吃的飽
飲料好喝又好拍
環境乾淨，金山大推咖啡店","The second visit, the food is really delicious, and also eats it
Drink delicious and easy to shoot
The environment is clean, Jinshan Big Push Coffee Shop"
"從金山回來的咖啡時間
它受歡迎的原因是它的位置和氛圍。
以露營為靈感的商店
咖啡裝在壺裡。
一個小茶壺
新鮮切片的鳳梨汁看起來很吸引人，碳酸味十足，味道鮮美。
另外，金山的地瓜牛奶飲料也很好喝。

"2018.04.09=來北海岸的靠北過日子，靠北一下 ^_^ 以位在北海岸景觀餐廳，這家供餐水平真的是意外的高。 (當然也不便宜就是了)

小卷咖哩烏龍麵，說實話，原本對這並不是很期待，景觀餐廳咩....。但口味說實話有嚇一跳，麵條有夠Q彈，對咖哩湯汁的吸附真是恰到好處，比上週劉山東優秀多了。湯頭咩...就遜，調理包等級。蔬菜跟半顆蛋蛋，中規中矩。這著小卷，唉唷唷，鮮嫩彈牙，一連驚呼三個，好~好~好!! 是料理功夫還是食材好吃已無所謂，這小卷真正好吃，6分。

黃檸檬動動蛋糕，看Google評論說蛋糕不優，嘖嘖。一入口，呵呵，檸檬的果醬跟偏濕的蛋糕本體相當合拍，含在嘴裡慢慢融化還是挺有意思的，雖然感覺還是粗糙了點....整體上算是好吃，不錯，5分。

鳳梨芒果百里香氣泡飲，店員交代兩次要攪拌均勻，我也攪拌了，還是未能查覺其精妙之處。 3分。單杯170元，嗯....吃蛋糕比較實際。

整體來說，若是來北海岸踏青看海，經過此處有想用餐，還是一間相當不錯的選擇。餐廳整齊明亮，佈置有意思，位置不錯是加分之處。文青必來。","2018.04.09 = Live on the north when you come to the North Coast, and you can go north ^ _ ^ Located on the north coast landscape restaurant. This meal level is really unexpectedly high.(Of course it is not cheap, just)

Small roll of curry oolong noodles, to be honest, it was not very looking forward to this, landscape restaurant ...But to be honest, the taste is frightened. The noodles are enough Q bombs. The adsorption of curry soup is really just right, much better than Liu Shandong last week.Tangtou ... it's inferior, conditioning package level.Vegetables and half eggs are quite satisfactory.This is a small volume, ah, the tender tender teeth, three exclaimed, good ~ good ~ good ~ !! It doesn't matter whether it is cooking or delicious ingredients. This small roll is really delicious, 6 points.

The yellow lemon moves the cake, watch Google commented that the cake is not good, alas.As soon as the entrance, huh, the lemon jam is quite integrated with the wet cake body, and it is very interesting to melt in the mouth slowly. Although it feels rough ... the overall is delicious, good, 5 points.

The pineapple mango fragrance was soaked in the aroma. The clerk explained that it would be stirred twice. I also stirred it. I still couldn't detect its subtleties.3 points.Single cup 170 yuan, um .... It is more practical to eat cakes.

On the whole, if you come to the North Coast to go to the sea to see the sea, there is a good choice after you want to dine here.The restaurant is neat and bright, the layout is interesting, and the position is good.Wen Qing will come."
"餐點非常好吃！雞腿咖哩烏龍麵必點 覺得值回票價
店員也很親切的介紹菜單 吹著海風喝著栗子奶茶很舒適 較適合開車前往 路旁有停車場可以停
下次絕對會再回訪❤️給五顆星🌟超滿意！ …","The meal is very delicious!Chicken leg curry oolong noodles must be worth the fare on the fare
The clerk is also very kind. The menu is very comfortable to drink the sea breeze and drink chestnut milk tea. It is suitable for driving to the roadside.
I will definitely return to visit next time ❤️ Give five stars 🌟 super satisfied!Mowing"
點了個 咖哩烏冬面 (小卷/雞腿) ， 本來對咖哩口味的烏冬面不抱期待，但上桌品嚐之後.....OMG好吃！ ！ ！  有咖哩味但不會重到把主菜的味道壓過去，讚！ ！ ！  雞腿很入味 就算跟麵一起擺上也沒把味道混淆，小卷也很鮮！ ！   店員妹妹也很認真的介紹 棒棒！ ！  旁邊還有小望遠鏡可以使用∼∼ 整體很棒的體驗哈哈哈,"I ordered a curry Udin Noodle (small roll/chicken leg). I didn't expect the curry Udon Noodles, but after the table was tasted ... OMG was delicious!IntersectionIntersectionThere is a curry flavor but it will not be re -reunited to suppress the taste of the main course, praise!IntersectionIntersectionThe chicken legs are very delicious. Even if you put it with your face, you do n’t confuse the taste, and the small roll is very fresh!IntersectionThe clerk and sister also introduced greatly!IntersectionThere is also a small telescope next to the small telescope to use the great experience. Hahaha"
"雖然千里迢迢的來到了這裡 但是覺得非常值得哦 店員很親切 介紹很詳盡～
整間店不管內外都非常的可愛有特色一樓還有賣特色商品及零食重點是餐點都很不錯有用心不是隨隨便便的微波食品或香精飲料哦～以下就來介紹一下覺得不錯的餐點👇🏻

The whole store is very cute in inside and outside. There are special features on the first floor and specialty products and snacks. The focus is that the meals are very good. It is not casual microwave food or flavor drinks. Dot

Bara North Taiwan Wheat Wine 180 yuan
There are really Bellatt!It's not bitter and smooth, really want to order a bottle of five flavors."
這是一家可愛的主題咖啡店，主題是露營（更像是glamping）。餐具、盤子等都是您在露營旅行中可能使用的物品，包括用於黑咖啡的保溫瓶。食物和飲料的味道都很普通（威士忌蘋果磅蛋糕太甜了），但是海景非常漂亮。,"This is a cute theme coffee shop, the theme is camping (more like Glamping).Tableware, plates, etc. are the items you may use during camping, including the insulation bottle for black coffee.The taste of food and beverages is very ordinary (whiskey is too sweet), but the sea view is very beautiful."
"座落於海岸邊的悠閒烏龍麵食館！

整棟建築採用藍色外漆，非常醒目！
不過停車位置有點隱密，很容易錯過或找不到…
整家店充滿了工業、簡約風，又帶點日式！

店內一樓區為小物品販售及展示區，有面牆上記錄了漂流到台灣的各國寶特瓶，看起來很有意境。卻也帶點感慨！

另外還有一些鼓勵大家環保的優惠活動可以參考。

餐點的部分，主餐以烏龍麵為主。
提供咖哩、奶油兩種湯底。咖哩偏辣，奶油則是牛奶的風味。兩種湯頭都有入味，麵條都是滿滿的湯味。
另外主食的部分很推薦雞腿！外皮烤得很酥，內肉醃在過，色澤有點帶粉紅，但味道亦是豐富！

除了主餐，還有提供檸檬水喝到飽！
服務人員介紹餐點非常詳細，也很熱情！

適合：文青、情侶約會、家庭聚餐。
不適合：想要便宜消費（低消250，外加5%清潔費）、隨便吃者。","Liche Uvan False Pastry on the coast!

The whole building uses blue paint, which is very eye -catching!
However, the parking location is a bit secret, it is easy to miss or find ...
The entire store is full of industry, simple style, and a little Japanese style!

The first floor of the store is a small item for sale and display area. There are noodle walls recorded the treasure bottle of various countries drifting to Taiwan, which looks very artistic.But I also have a little emotion!

There are also some preferential activities that encourage everyone to environmental protection to refer to.

For the meal part, the main meal is mainly oolong noodles.
Provide two soup bases of curry and cream.The curry is spicy, and the cream is the flavor of milk.Both soups have flavors, and noodles are full of soup.
In addition, the staple food is recommended for chicken legs!The outer skin is very crispy, the inner meat is marinated, and the color is a bit pink, but the taste is also rich!

In addition to the main meal, there are also lemonade to drink!
The service staff introduced the meal very detailed and very enthusiastic!

Suitable: Wenqing, couple dating, family dinner.
Not suitable: want cheaper consumption (low 250, plus 5%cleaning costs), casual eat."
氣氛很好，也可以坐在外面🌞🏄‍♂️不幸的是我們要等比較長的時間才能吃到食物，否則一切都好👌 …,"The atmosphere is very good, you can also sit outside 🌞🏄‍♂️ Unfortunately, we have to wait for a long time to eat food, otherwise everything is good ..."
靠近海灘的很棒的咖啡館！氣氛、食物、服務都很棒。這裡非常適合工作日度假（週末停車可能會很困難或很貴）。肯定會再造訪<3,"A great cafe near the beach!The atmosphere, food, and service are great.It is very suitable for working days (parking on weekends may be difficult or expensive).Will definitely visit <3"
一個頗有特色的店名，在北海岸公路的路上特別顯眼，店內濃濃的設計風格很酷，咖哩的烏冬麵份量很多料也很多，但是價錢稍貴而且需要排隊等候。,"A distinctive store name is particularly conspicuous on the road of the North Coast Highway. The strong design style in the store is cool. The amount of Udin noodles of curry is a lot of materials, but the price is slightly more expensive and needs to be lined up."
"優點是：位置很棒，屋頂可以看到美麗的海灘景色。不過，在瘋狂的日子裡，天氣確實會變得非常熱。飲料很清爽。

不好的事情......他們主要提供湯！在海灘上？夏天？天熱嗎？沒有什麼比乳蛋餅更清爽的了（只有兩種選擇：洛林和蘑菇）
尺寸相當小。正如您在照片中看到的那樣，僅比手指大一點。
就其本身而言，價格相當昂貴，因為味道也不是很好。但好吧，你是為裝飾和景觀付出代價的。","The advantage is: the location is great, and the beautiful beach view can be seen on the roof.However, in crazy days, the weather does become very hot.The drink is very refreshing.

Bad things ... they mainly provide soup!On the beach?summer?Is it hot?Nothing is more refreshing than dairy egg cakes (only two options: Lorraine and mushrooms)
The size is quite small.As you see in the photo, it is only a little bigger than your fingers.
As far as it is concerned, the price is quite expensive, because the taste is not very good.But okay, you pay the price for decoration and landscape."
"靠近海岸的好地方，您可以在那裡享用美味佳餚
氣氛很好，一樓有小購物區
我去的時候天氣不太好，所以沒能看到戶外區域，但我肯定想回來看看！","A good place near the coast, you can enjoy delicious dishes there
The atmosphere is good, there is a small shopping area on the first floor
When I went, the weather was not very good, so I couldn't see the outdoor area, but I definitely wanted to come back to see it!"
咖哩雞腿烏龍麵，大塊綿密的馬鈴薯家加上香甜胡蘿蔔，大塊鮮嫩的去骨雞腿，超喜歡的呀，清涼的水果氣泡飲，好喝。假日真的好多人呀,"Curry chicken legs oolong noodles, large pieces of potato home plus sweet carrots, large pieces of tender bone chicken legs, super favorite, cool fruit bubble drink, delicious.There are really many people on holidays"
喜歡這家咖啡館的戶外氛圍。他們提供了大量的食物和飲料。會再來這裡,Like the outdoor atmosphere of this cafe.They provide a lot of food and drinks.Will come here again

咖哩烏龍麵很稀 檸檬洞蛋糕香但乾 飲料就是視覺效果而已,"Curry oolong noodles are very rare lemon cave cake fragrance, but dry drinks are the visual effects"
好吃😋好拍📷大推,"It's delicious, good shot, big push"
地瓜派超好吃完全🈴️我的地瓜胃🍠💞💞💞💞 …,The sweet potato school is super delicious 我 ️ My sweet potato stomach 🍠💞💞💞💞 ...
西北海岸放空的好地方！推！,A good place for the northwest coast!push!
舒適的小地方有美味的食物。衝浪後喝杯湯是最好的！,There are delicious food in a comfortable small place.It is best to drink a cup of soup after surfing!
位置非常好，靠近大海。氣氛很好，老闆也很好。即使天氣不好，仍然是與朋友聚會的好地方！,"The location is very good, close to the sea.The atmosphere is very good, and the boss is also very good.Even if the weather is not good, it is still a good place to meet with friends!"
"我很驚訝服務如此糟糕^-^！
據說甜點需要20分鐘，但一個小時後還沒來，所以我問了，被告知他們已經給了另一個顧客！","I am surprised that the service is so bad^-^!
It is said that the dessert takes 20 minutes, but it has not come one hour later, so I asked, and I was told that they had given another customer!"
食物絕對令人垂涎欲滴，而且擺盤精緻。如果您碰巧在那裡，沿海景觀也是必看的。服務還可以，但空調似乎運作不佳，因為我們大多數人在用餐過程中都出汗了，其他客人甚至因為原來的桌子太熱而換了座位。但總而言之，我仍然強烈推薦 Quiet B. Days 😎 …,"Food is absolutely mouth -watering, and it is exquisite.If you happen to be there, the coastal landscape is also necessary.The service is okay, but the air conditioner seems to be poorly operated, because most of us sweat during the meal, and other guests even changed their seats because the original table was too hot.But in all, I still strongly recommend Quiet B. Days 😎 ..."
很好吃的咖哩烏龍麵👍,Very delicious curry oolong noodles 👍
非常幸運地坐到了只有兩席的野餐風格座位區，是一個放鬆伸展的好地方；主打的烏冬麵麵體雖普普，但烤雞腿好吃；甜點類也不錯，整體來說是一個放鬆的好地方。後方的中角也算是衝浪祕境。餐廳沒有停車位但後方有停車場但有點小且出入口不好找。,"I was very lucky to sit in a picnic -style seat area with only two seats, which is a good place to relax and stretch; although the main Udon Mask is predated, the grilled chicken legs are delicious; desserts are also good, overall, it is a relaxed one. Good place.The middle corner of the rear is also considered a secret of surfing.There is no parking space in the restaurant, but there is a parking lot at the rear but a little small and the entrance is difficult to find."
非常好的地方，裝飾和飲料都很棒。,"Very good place, decoration and drink are great."
他們非常努力地成為一個看起來很時尚的地方，並且在室內設計方面比該地區附近的其他咖啡館更好。然而，當我發現他們不提供拿鐵咖啡或卡布奇諾咖啡，而是滴濾咖啡時，我有點失望，但沒關係，它仍然是一杯咖啡。當咖啡裝在一個有塑膠杯的保溫瓶中時，我們後悔沒有去隔壁。咖啡和蛋糕的味道就像7-11的一樣。,"They work very hard to become a very fashionable place, and they are better in interior design than other cafes near the area.However, when I found that they did not provide latte coffee or Kabchino coffee, but when I dripped coffee, I was a little disappointed, but it didn't matter, it was still a cup of coffee.When the coffee is installed in a thermos bottle with a plastic cup, we regret not going next door.The taste of coffee and cake is like 7-11."
專門開車過去兩次，一次晴天，一次下雨天，別有一番風景。,"Specialized for driving twice, a sunny day, and a rainy day, don't have a scenery."
我家人最喜歡去的地方，有美麗的景色、飲料、食物和服務！,"The place where my family likes to go is beautiful scenery, drinks, food and services!"
"我覺得服務不太好！
我們留下了聯繫方式
我們沒有任何電話！
差不多一個小時我們才回到店裡
工作人員：我們打了兩次電話給你！
沒有人回答
所以我。顯示通話記錄
沒人打電話！ WT......
於是我們又等了20分鐘
我們點了一份海鮮麵（不加鹽）
我們點了2杯飲料，一個煎餅🥞
地瓜核桃餡餅！
反正。  不推薦","I think the service is not very good!
We left a contact information
We don't have any call!
We returned to the store for almost an hour
Staff: We called you twice!
No one answered
So I.Display call records
No one calls!Wt ......
So we waited for another 20 minutes
We ordered a seafood noodle (without salt)
We ordered 2 cups of drinks, one pancake 🥞
Sweet potato walnut pie!
Anyway.Not recommend"
價格有點高，不符合它的口味。 CP值低。老闆關掉空調，試著透過風扇引入自然空氣，但失敗了，讓室內不舒服。好主意，但您應該在成本控制方面考慮客戶的舒適度。,"The price is a bit high, not in line with its taste.CP value is low.The boss turned off the air conditioner and tried to introduce natural air through the fan, but failed, making the room uncomfortable.Good idea, but you should consider customer comfort in terms of cost control."
"網紅地點，年輕人的打卡地點。
主食只有烏龍麵，每人低消250元。我年紀大，不適合這種這裡。
其實是吃不慣烏龍麵的！ 😂 …","Net red location, young people's punch locations.
The staple food is only oolong noodles, and each person eliminates 250 yuan.I am old and not suitable for this.
In fact, you can't get used to oolong noodles!😂 😂 ..."
餐廳小小的很可愛，佈置的是可愛露營風，生意好客人很多，餐點容易賣完，建議先訂位，店員很親切,The restaurant is very cute. It is a cute and open camp. There are a lot of good guests in business. The meals are easy to sell. It is recommended to book a place first. The clerk is very kind.
相當高估了，非常時尚，但蛋糕平淡無奇。咖啡很不錯，但在其他地方可以找到更好的價格。風格和美學勝過品質和實質的典型地方。,"It is quite oversight, very fashionable, but the cake is bland.Coffee is very good, but you can find better prices elsewhere.Style and aesthetics are better than typical places of quality and essence."
這是一家小咖啡館和商店。屋頂上有一些座位，從甲板上可以看到大海。我們嘗試了蘋果磅蛋糕和兩杯飲料。非常好。,"This is a small cafe and a store.There are some seats on the roof, which can be seen from the deck.We tried Apple pound cakes and two cups of beverages.very good."
海灘的美景和友好的服務。食物的選擇有限，但我吃的辣雞肉三明治很好吃。坐在屋頂上慢慢享用啤酒。,"Beach beautiful scenery and friendly service.The choice of food is limited, but the spicy chicken sandwiches I eat are delicious.Sitting on the roof and enjoying beer slowly."
舒適的環境，愉快的服務！咖啡飲料還不錯，還有一些台灣特產的啤酒。,"A comfortable environment, happy service!Coffee drinks are pretty good, and there are some Taiwanese specialty beer."
驚人的,Amazing
四季春冰淇淋豪好ㄔ～～～,Four Seasons Spring Ice Cream is so good ~~~
整體來說氣氛不錯，但咖啡用塑膠杯？嗯..我個人不喜歡它。因此，不完美的 4/5 評級。,"Overall the atmosphere, but coffee plastic cups?Well .. I personally don't like it.Therefore, imperfect 4/5 rating."
很用心的小店❤️,Very careful shop ❤️
放空的好地方～舒服！,Good place to let go ~ comfortable!
很有度假的氣氛，但是半自助又要加5%清潔費（不太合理），咖哩烏龍還可以（$270有點貴），咖啡推哥倫比亞（杯子不太好倒）,"There is a very atmosphere of vacation, but semi -self -service adds 5%cleaning fee (not reasonable), curry oolong is okay ($ 270 a bit expensive), coffee push Colombia (the cup is not very good)"
好食物 好地方,Good food and good place
好吃好喝,Delicious and delicious
咖啡不錯（只有黑咖啡），磅蛋糕也不錯！平日去的，幸運的是人不多。,"Coffee is good (only black coffee), and the pound cake is also good!There are not many people who go on weekdays."
茶和蛋糕都不錯~,Tea and cake are good ~
我們本來打算在那裡喝杯咖啡看日落，但是當我們到達時他們告訴我們必須在關門時間前 90 分鐘到達。這是一個笑話。它甚至沒有發佈在網上。,"We originally planned to drink a cup of coffee there to watch the sunset, but when we arrived, they told us that we must arrive 90 minutes before closing time.This is a joke.It was not even published online."
氣氛很棒🫕🥧☕ …,The atmosphere is great ...
海濱餐廳，露營的感覺，氣氛很好。,"The seaside restaurant, the feeling of camping, the atmosphere is very good."
咖啡很好。人們去那裡大多是為了欣賞風景，沿著海岸開車。,Coffee is very good.Most people go there to enjoy the scenery and drive along the coast.
"涼爽的地方，美味的咖啡，是在海灘度過一天後放鬆身心的完美場所。
看看2樓和3樓。","In a cool place, delicious coffee is a perfect place to relax the body and mind after spending a day on the beach.
Look at the 2nd and 3rd floors."
食物的選擇非常少。小份。價格過高。裡面太熱了。,There are very few food choices.Small portions.The price is too high.It's too hot inside.
可愛的地方。蛋糕還可以。咖啡還是不錯的。,Cute place.The cake is okay.Coffee is still good.
看海的好地方,Good place to see the sea
普通,usually
非常寒冷的地方，景色優美，但食物和飲料真的很不錯...,"Very cold place, beautiful scenery, but food and drinks are really good ..."
真的很涼爽舒適的咖啡館，有甜點，你不想離開的地方,"It's really cool and comfortable cafes, there are desserts, where you don’t want to leave"
好吃 好喝 好拍照的地方,"It's delicious, delicious, good, take pictures"
安靜舒適的地方，位於海邊，提供美味的食物、清涼的飲料和美味獨特的甜點,"Quiet and comfortable places, located on the seaside, providing delicious food, cool drinks and delicious desserts"
看海很舒服，可坐一下午,"It is very comfortable to see the sea, but you can sit for an afternoon"
出乎意料的好咖啡館/餐廳。屋頂享有美景。,Unexpectedly good cafe/restaurant.The roof has beautiful scenery.
一個不錯的地方,A good place
一定要再來這裡一次！,Must come here again!
很棒的店,Great shop
