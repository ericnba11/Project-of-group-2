"剛好餐廳就在捷運站附近走200公尺
我們點燃 Blaze 套餐+6杯餐酒搭配

從這道胭脂蝦/海苔片佐北海道海膽/蕃茄燉飯揭開陣陣驚呼
海膽超鮮甜！和香脆海苔片一口吃下，在嘴裡海浪拍打🌊

伊比利豬里肌/酸豆泥/奶油杏仁醬/芥蘭
不得不說主廚除了很會玩火
他特調出來的醬汁每一款都像是專門為肉類與海鮮打造一樣，我敢說我的人生中，還沒吃過這麼神的醬汁✨

澳洲野生紅袋鼠後腿肉端上桌時我以為是牛肉，沒想到是袋鼠肉
本來有點怕怕的，入口以後仔細咀嚼，竟然有像牛肉般的風味，直火牢牢鎖住肉汁，處理的恰到好處！

我和老公在6杯白酒與紅酒的搭配下，
吃完一致認為窯烤跟燒肉料理出來的餐點，
完全無法和直火料理相比

尤其超過這家以後，真的大大圈粉❤️

主廚Nick實在功力深厚！
⚠️坐在吧台前面看他玩火真的magic🪄","Just happen to take 200 meters near the MRT station

The sea urchin is super fresh!Take a bite with crispy seaweed tablets and shoot in the mouth of the mouth.

Ibilia pigment/sour bean puree/cream almond sauce/kale
I have to say that the chef will play with the fire except
Each of the sauce he specially adjusted is like making meat and seafood. I dare to say that in my life, I haven't eaten such sauce.

When the Australian wild red kangaroo hind legs on the table, I thought it was beef.
It was a bit scared. After the entrance was chewed carefully, it had a beef -like flavor.

My husband and I have a 6 glass of white wine and red wine,
After eating, I think of the meal that is cooked with pork grilled and roasted meat.
Can't compare with straight fire dishes at all

姐姐來上菜：感謝朋友的用心，現在大家工作忙碌出國，能夠聚在一起非常不容易。第一次來，滿心期待，今晚品嚐了新加坡主廚聯名系列，只是主菜是咖喱牛有點寂寞，聽說主廚的烤工很厲害，只是今晚菜色已新加坡為主，沒有表現到。搭配一系列的paring，雖然自然酒這幾年很流行，但朋友和我沒有很喜歡。店家服務非常好，感謝招待🙏🙏,"My sister came to eat: Thank you for your intentions. Now that everyone is busy working abroad, it is not easy to get together.For the first time, I was looking forward to it.

"總結：人均消費超過5000的高級料理店，整體來說，菜色搭配是好的，風格很美式，調味很足很到位，環境氣氛、音樂都很好。
以上是優點，再來要講缺點。
服務人員的「輕聲」細語，讓人聽不清介紹說什麼，介紹食材時，同一道菜，一下介紹本港鱈魚、一下介紹土魠，一下介紹紐約客一下介紹肋眼，感覺員工訓練的部分不是很足（所以介紹才都這麼小聲？），主餐兩道肉類，一個羊鞍、一個牛肉，羊鞍我切4口3口有筋，牛肉也是最後一口有一大塊筋，我都吐在盤上，但並未有人關心此事，頗為失望。
然後，希望主廚能重視食材的季節性，這個秋冬天應該有很多比瑩烏賊更適合做直火料理的食材吧⋯
補充，看了有些留言有寫到男性會吃不飽，即使加點了也吃不飽，但餐廳並不會詢問飽足感的部分，會有多則留言，也顯示了餐廳沒有感受到客人反饋要調整菜單的意願，整體cp值很低。","Summary: Senior cooking shops with per capita consumption of more than 5,000. On the whole, the dishes are good, the style is very beautiful, the seasoning is very well -in place, and the environmental atmosphere and music are very good.
The above is the advantage, come again to talk about the shortcomings.
The ""soft voice"" of the service staff makes people unable to hear what the introduction is. When introducing ingredients, the same dish, introduce the cod in Hong Kong, introduce the soil crickets. Not very enough (So the introduction is so whispered?), The main meal two meats, one saddle, one beef, the saddle, I cut 4 mouthfuls and three mouths, and the beef is the last bite. On the market, no one cares about the matter, and it is quite disappointed.
Then, I hope that the chef can pay attention to the seasonality of the ingredients. This autumn and winter should have a lot of ingredients that are more suitable for straight fire dishes than Ying Squid.
In addition, after reading some messages, some men can eat that men will not be full. Even if they are added, they will not be full, but the restaurant will not ask the full sense of fullness. There will be many messages. To adjust the wishes of the menu, the overall CP value is very low.",False

"#台北餐廳 #A小姐的美食人生

比較少到士林這一帶吃飯，
但可以為了 @fireplaytaipei 特地前來～

台北少數且非常美味的直火料理餐廳。

直火料理以火焰去呈現食材的本質也回歸到傳統的料理手法。

Fireplay 的主廚 Nick曾待過台北和香港的知名餐廳，
擁有相當豐富且厲害的餐飲經驗，
除了把火玩的很厲害之外、調味醬料也是一絕 🤤🔥

無菜單的 Fireplay,
主廚每週會親自前往當地市場挑選食材，
依照每日食材狀況的不同去做調整，
每道菜呈現的方式也會不大一樣。

餐廳室內空間以板前座位的方式展現，
讓客人用餐的同時也可以同步看到主廚正在料理每道菜餚。

從前菜到主菜跟最後的甜點都讓人十分驚艷，
最喜歡圖一跟三這個蟹肉海膽飯，
粒粒分明的飯配上主廚特調的濃郁醬汁，
上面還有滿滿的蟹肉跟海膽，
一口吃下簡直太幸福了🥰

主餐的牛肉跟需要跟每日限量的薩索雞也都超棒！
直火帶出食物的香氣、在配上厲害的醬汁，
道道都令人難忘～

限量的薩索雞務必要加點，
是他們的招牌，
皮脆脆的配上多汁鮮嫩的雞肉，
沒有吃到等於沒來過這裡用餐呀！

最後的甜點也很厲害，
焦糖爆米花起司～
原本只想淺嚐一口的我不小心把它整個吃掉了…

這次用餐比較可惜的是這次沒有拍到正在玩火的主廚🤣

I have less to eat in Shilin,
But you can come for @fireplaytaipei ~

There are few and very delicious straight -fire restaurants in Taipei.

The essence of straight fire dishes with flames to present ingredients also returns to traditional cooking techniques.

Fireplay's chef Nick has stayed in well -known restaurants in Taipei and Hong Kong,
Have a very rich and powerful catering experience,
In addition to playing with the fire, the seasoning sauce is also a must

Fireplay without menu,
The chef will go to the local market every week to choose ingredients,
Adjust according to the different daily ingredient status,
The way of each dish will be not the same.

The interior space of the restaurant is displayed in front of the board,
At the same time, guests can also be seen simultaneously to see the chef are cooking each dish.

From the predecessor to the main course and the last dessert, it is very amazing.
Favorite picture one and three crab meat sea urchin rice,
The grain with clear rice with the rich sauce specially tuned by the chef,
There are also full of crab meat and sea urchin,
It's too happy to eat it in one bite 🥰

The main meal beef and the daily limited Sasso chicken are also great!
The aroma of the food brings out the food, with a powerful sauce,
The Tao is unforgettable ~

Limited Sasso chickens must add points,
It is their signature,
The skin is crunchy with juicy and tender chicken,
I haven't eaten it, I have never been here to eat here!

The last dessert is also very powerful,
Caramel popcorn cheese ~
I just wanted to taste it, I accidentally ate it all ...

This time it is a pity that this time I didn’t take the chef who was playing fire.

朋友帶路來嚐鮮，幸運地有訂到位子，沒想到就在愛店鳥哲旁邊，店面有點低調很容易錯過，FirePlay採取無菜單料理方式，有1800元/1人或2400元/1人兩種價格，差異在於某幾道料理的食材會升級，wine pairing 800元/1人，氣泡水1瓶180元，第一次來便先嘗試1800元的菜色。第一道烤玉米筍的佐吻仔魚，吻仔魚炸的酥脆增添口感，並用吻仔魚的鹹度帶出玉米筍的鮮甜；第二道烤皎白筍，直接吃就很好吃，搭配一點味噌醬有不同風味；第三道鮑魚佐柚子海苔醬搭海葡萄，鮑魚本身鮮度夠，柚子海苔醬有點相似黑胡椒牛排醬，本身沒特別愛這個味道和搭配；第四道天使紅蝦燉飯，米心偏硬可能會有點不習慣，但調味好美味；第五道烤鯖魚佐酸豆生菜，鯖魚不夠肥美有點可惜，不過搭酸豆生菜還不錯；第六道烤松阪豬佐生蛋黃醬，松阪豬本身就刷有照燒醬，烤得恰到好處，油脂鮮甜，好吃，佐生蛋黃醬別有風味，但對我來說再搭上醬汁有點太重口味；第七道烤雞佐芥末黃醬和雞心，另外會附上現烤麵包，雞心令人非常驚艷而且毫無腥味，麵包又香又脆可以沾醬吃，雞肉烤得恰到好處；最後有甜點和飲料，甜點裡面有我愛的榛果！搭配的味道我也喜歡，只是鮮奶油有點多會有點膩。,"Friends brought their way to try something new, but fortunately I had a seat.

"服務如預期般的很好因為這是$3800/人的套餐

但份量或cp值的話只能給0.5星，創意歸創意但一頓餐還是要看整體的若$3800的食物連一個便當盒都裝不滿的話，那有時候做夢夢到吃美食時可能還算吃到更飽（或許有錢人的世界跟我想像的不一樣？）

甜點的份量總體積大概像6顆骰子那麼多（骰子，不是骰子牛）

飲料部分就是飲料，茶或手沖

扣除上述，剩六道菜，所以想想$3800/6這個數字

第一道菜是 一口蔥 對一口

蝦子那個好吃但頓飯也是一口

依比例豬兩片

牛肉（我假設這是主菜之一）大概是.....1.5盎司，然後咬不斷的筋，跟店員反應後說...他們是澳洲和牛，跟日本和牛不一樣，所以才會這樣。唉對澳洲和牛失望（？） 3800元最期待的牛肉結果感受度像是平價鐵板燒裡最頂級的牛肉差不多。

主打fire play, 眼前可以看到炭火，但大部分的料理好像都只有裝飾跟這個有關，例如擺盤放很多碎木炭。只有第一道的“一口蔥”有碳烤的口感及味道。但就一口。","The service is good as expected because this is a $ 3800/person package

However, if the portion or CP value can only be given 0.5 stars, creativity is creative, but a meal still depends on the overall food. It's more full (Perhaps the world of rich people is different from what I imagined?)

The total volume of the dessert is about 6 dice (dice, not a dice cow)

The beverage part is drinking, tea or hand punching

Exclude the above, there are six dishes left, so think about the number of $ 3800/6

The first dish is a bite

The delicious but meal of the shrimp is also a sip of meals

Two pigs in proportion

Beef (I assume that this is one of the main dishes) is probably ... 1.5 ounces, and then bite the constant tendons and said after responding to the clerk ... they are Australian and beef.

"很喜歡這間店圍著中島和火爐們的開放廚房，自信的主廚在客人面前被一覽無遺，把料理做成工藝，是色香味俱全的表演。

坐在吧台讓主廚可以隨時和客人互動，即時觀察客人的反饋和需求，這對調整口味和提供服務有很大的幫助。

Nick選用很高比例的台灣在地食材，客人坐在吧台邊，更能瞭解到整個料理步驟和調味簡化，卻又拼湊出每一道菜不同的鮮味和口感。

火候部分就是主廚的絕活啦，也是這間店的精髓。廚房有三種爐，火候不同，全靠Nick調控，大概就是一種「火感」吧！

端上桌的海鮮，無論是蚌殼淡菜、魚或蝦，本身已屬鮮美肥美，烤過之後又能落在最適當的嫩度。烤雞表皮脆得很，雞肉卻很嫩。牛肉吃起來像舒肥效果，上桌依然保持中間的粉紅肉質。黑毛豬霜降肉配上獨門的蛋黃醬汁，更增加口感的彈性，有種吃壽喜燒沾蛋汁的感覺。

蔬菜部分，這次吃到烤生菜配脆的吻仔魚，以及一個超想加碼單點的烤馬鈴薯。馬鈴薯淋上炒到焦糖化的培根洋蔥，太好吃了啊！

甜點外表是奶油，內心是太妃糖配夏威夷果。甜點的趣味在上桌之前，主廚用君度橙酒來一段火焰秀，又香又好看。

除了料理，店裡也配了豐富的酒單，這次只點了一杯白酒提味，感受不深，但可以確定這家店的料理配點飲料會更好，葡萄酒或果汁之類，和食材有相輔相成的效果。

這家店目前主打無菜單料理，菜色不固定，以雙人套餐為主，客人都是雙數，有幾道肉是兩人共享。價格中高，依食材、口味及服務來看相當合理。是會再訪的店。","I like the open kitchen around Nakajima and the stoves. The confident chef is seen in front of the guests. It is a performance of the dishes as a process.

Sitting on the bar allows the chef to interact with the guests at any time and observe the feedback and needs of guests in real time, which is very helpful for adjusting the taste and providing services.

Nick uses a very high proportion of Taiwan to local ingredients. Guests sit by the bar to understand the entire cooking steps and seasoning simplified, but they are put together for different umami flavors and tastes of each dish.

The heat part is the best of the chef, and the essence of this shop.There are three types of furnaces in the kitchen. The heat is different. It depends on nick regulation, probably a kind of ""fire""!

The seafood on the table, whether it is a mussel shell, fish, or shrimp, it is already delicious and beautiful, and it can fall in the most appropriate tenderness after roasting.The roast chicken watches are very crispy, but the chicken is very tender.The beef tastes like a fat effect, and it still maintains the pink meat in the middle.Black -haired pig frost drops with unique egg yolk sauce, which increases the elasticity of the taste, and has the feeling of eating longevity.

In the vegetable part, this time I eat roasted lettuce with crispy kiss fish, and a roasted potato that wants to add a single point.The potatoes are poured on the bacon onion with caramel, which is so delicious!

The appearance of the dessert is cream, and the heart is the fruit of the concubine sugar.Before the dessert, the taste of the dessert, the chef Jun Du orange wine came with a flame show, which was fragrant and beautiful.

In addition to cooking, the store is also equipped with rich wine lists. This time, I only ordered a glass of white wine to taste. It is not deeply felt, but it can be determined that the restaurant of this shop will be better. The effect of complement each other.

This shop currently focuses on no menu dishes. The dishes are not fixed. They are mainly two -person package. The guests are double -numbers.

主廚情緒嚴重影響客人用餐，開放式廚房下建議主廚再怎麼不爽也要控制好自己情緒！
從沒在一個自稱待過米其林的主廚餐廳有過這種用餐經驗，以下是事發經過，分享給大家。
用餐中間詢問服務人員結帳發票是否提供餐點細項明細，服務人員表示沒有。因商務需求再次詢問需餐點明細手寫也沒關係最後蓋上店章即可，服務人員說要詢問接著進到開放式廚房詢問主廚，主廚在第一次詢問已經可以感受到不開心，第二次被服務人員訊問後不滿情緒在開放式廚房下表露無疑！
放盤子跟用櫥具時非常大聲，很明顯聽到聲音而且動作開始很大，跟一開始前幾道菜完全不一樣，我相信服務人員也有感受到。
很謝謝服務人員耐心態度很好的幫忙詢問事後又將明細簡訊給我，重點是主廚在開放式廚房下大家都看著的環境還如此這樣的明顯表達自己的不滿，即使我們的要求很繁雜要不當面拒絕，沒有必要讓接受主廚不開心的情緒！

不論是主廚態度及餐點都不推薦！","Very unpleasant and uncomfortable dining experience.

It doesn't matter. Finally, the service staff said that he would ask the chef to enter the open kitchen. After being questioned by the service personnel, he was dissatisfied in the open kitchen after he was questioned!
The dish was very loud when using the cabinet. It was obvious that the sound was heard and the movement began to have a lot. It was completely different from the first few dishes. I believe that the service staff also felt it.
Thank you very much for the service staff to have a good patience for helping ask me after asking for the details. The focus is that the environment that everyone watched under the open kitchen that everyone watched is so obviously expressing their dissatisfaction.

馬鈴薯鬆軟散發淡淡奶香，生火腿筋有點多

＊馬祖淡菜｜白酒奶油醬
淡菜新鮮軟嫩，醬汁酸爽解膩

＊胭脂蝦｜海膽｜烏魚子｜蕃茄燉飯
海味豐富的一道，但海膽有點水、米心對我來說真的太硬了

*長尾鳥｜芹菜根｜水蓮葉
魚肉扎實，芹菜根酸豆碎沙拉清爽解膩反而是亮點

＊伊比利豬肋排｜培根醬｜咖啡
培根醬充滿煙燻味似美式BBQ，豬肉還算嫩

＊和牛橫隔膜｜松露｜巧巴達
肉質軟嫩無筋，醬汁焦化奶油香氣十足，搭配外酥內軟嫩的巧巴達真的非常好吃

＊薩索雞｜雞心｜芥末子醬 (加點品項)
經風乾的雞皮烤的香脆不油，肉質軟嫩香氣濃郁，雞心的熟度也處理的剛好；搭上酸度高的醬汁解膩，非常推薦加點(可供兩人分食)

＊玉米Mascarpone｜爆米花｜焦糖醬
吃不太出起司的感覺，玉米焦糖味重，調味過甜

整體而言是滿意的，雖然食材簡單，也沒有過多或特殊的處理工序，但主廚對於醬汁的運用很令人驚艷，能讓原食材有畫龍點睛的效果。有機會不妨一試。","All charcoal straight -fire dishes, showing the most primitive and rough and delicious food of the ingredients.

＊ Corn Mascarpone ｜ Popcorn ｜ caramel sauce
The feeling of the cheese is not very good, the corn caramel has a heavy flavor, the seasoning is too sweet
