天花板太低有壓迫感，以前水瀑布還沒被Vip包廂擋起來的時候比較美，上次舞台右邊音響靜音了30分鐘～一小時,"The ceiling is too low to have a sense of oppression. Before the water waterfall was not blocked by the VIP box, it was more beautiful. The sound of the last on the right of the last stage was silent for 30 minutes to one hour.",False

"幾年前，這是世界上我最喜歡的俱樂部之一。我在這裡度過了很多美好的夜晚。與該地區的許多俱樂部一樣，您可以在入場時獲得兩張免費飲品券 - 而且您不僅限於像 Omni 這樣的喜力啤酒。
在最近的一次訪問中，我感覺它倒退了幾步。室外露台關閉了，裡面原來的瀑布似乎被桌子取代了。他們還曾經有另一家播放室內音樂的酒吧，但現在要么關門了，要么完全消失了。然而，音樂仍然很好聽，飲料很濃，人群很有趣，令人賞心悅目。如果可以的話我會給它 3.5 分，但由於我過去在那裡玩得很開心，所以我會四捨五入到 4 分。","A few years ago, this is one of my favorite clubs in the world.I have a lot of beautiful nights here.Like many clubs in the area, you can get two free drink coupons at the time of entering -and you are not limited to Xili Beer like Omni.
During a recent visit, I felt it a few steps back.The outdoor terrace was closed, and the original waterfall inside seemed to be replaced by the table.They also had another bar playing indoor music, but now they are either closed or completely disappeared.However, the music is still very good, the drink is very strong, the crowd is very interesting and pleasing to the eye.If I can, I will give it 3.5 points, but because I have played very well there, I will score 4 points in four.",False
"週三晚上，開2瓶黃金儲備和1瓶詩珞珞伏特加，16500新台幣，可以坐沙發。攪拌機內僅含 2 罐可樂。夜晚靜謐，人煙稀少。沒關係。保留了 2 瓶並在週五晚上回來。拿出了那兩瓶，但服務生說沒有攪拌機！ （那如果沒有攪拌機要怎麼喝呢？）
我們不再有權利擁有任何沙發。如果要的話，還得再付15,000台幣。難以置信。我們花了450元台幣買了3罐可樂。

真沒想到台北一家所謂的頂級俱樂部竟然有這種水準。

服務：3/10
費用：高
性價比/樂趣：1/10

有了這些錢，本可以從其他俱樂部得到更多的樂趣。在給 1 顆星之前甚至必須考慮很長時間。","On Wednesday night, 2 bottles of gold reserves and 1 bottle of poems vodka, 16,500 NT $ 1,6,500, can sit on the sofa.There are only 2 cans of cola in the mixer.The night is quiet and the people are scarce.It doesn't matter.Keep 2 bottles and come back on Friday night.I took out the two bottles, but the waiter said there was no mixer!(How do you drink without a mixer?)
We no longer have the right to have any sofas.If you want, you have to pay another 15,000 Taiwan dollars.incredible.We spent 450 yuan to buy 3 cans of cola.

I did not expect that a so -called top club in Taipei had this level.

飲料的選擇有限，啤酒真的很糟糕。  最重要的是，服務很糟糕！在入口、電梯和儲物櫃裡就像對待動物一樣。工作人員非常粗魯！ ……而且還相當昂貴！,"The choice of drinks is limited, and beer is really bad.The most important thing is that the service is bad!In the entrance, elevator, and lockers, it is like treating animals.The staff is very rude!... and it's quite expensive!",False
如果你是外國人，請和當地朋友一起來，否則前面的人可能會咒罵你並偷走你的雨傘。有一些更好的俱樂部不僱用種族主義員工。,"If you are a foreigner, please come with local friends, otherwise the people in front may curse you and steal your umbrella.Some better clubs do not hire racist employees.",False
