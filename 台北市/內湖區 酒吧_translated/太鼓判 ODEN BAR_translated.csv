"關東煮吃了好多年還真沒點過炸豬排😆

—富士蘋果醬炸豬排—

平常來通常只會點關東煮，大不了加一些烤物，完全沒想過要點炸豬排，沒想到吃了之後驚為天人，甚至比很多豬排專賣店還要強，豬排本身麵衣不算厚也不刮嘴，單吃調味不太重，加上旁邊的蘋果醬後味道變得很有趣，微甜蘋果味的炸豬排意外的還蠻順口的。中間還可以搭配旁邊的生菜絲與蘋果片轉換一下口感，但烤吐司串就不知道在幹麻了，口感上感覺應該是烤得不夠酥，導致整個口感很尷尬😅。

—特撰燒雞串—

口味上一串是鹽烤，另一串是醬燒。烤製的火候把控的很好，外皮微焦的狀態下，內部已經熟了且仍飽和水份。醬燒也不是走重鹹派的，醬香微甜還帶有炭香。若只點關東煮再點上一份也是很爽的！

- Fuji apple sauce fried pork chop-

Usually, I usually only order Kanto cooking. I have added some grilled objects. I never thought about the main point fried pork chops. I did not expect to be shocked after eating. It was even stronger than many pork chop stores. Scrape your mouth, the seasoning is not heavy, and the taste becomes very interesting after the apple sauce next to it. The slightly sweet apple -flavored pork chop is unexpectedly smooth.In the middle, you can also use the lettuce shreds and apple slices next to the taste, but the grilled toast skewers do not know that they are dry and numb. The taste should not be baked enough, which makes the whole taste embarrassed.

- Special roast chicken skewers-

The flavor is roasted with salt, and the other is sauce.The baking heat controlled very well. In the state of slightly scorched the outer skin, the interior was cooked and still saturated water.The sauce is not heavy and salty, and the sauce is slightly sweet and has charcoal fragrance.It would be very cool if you just order Kanto to cook again!

"內湖這邊很知名的關東煮名店，位在金湖路上，門口旁邊擺著幾桶大型的日本清酒，配上低調的招牌，還有櫃檯旁琳瑯滿目的酒牆，再再表明這裡是個有吃有喝的好地方（？！）

由於也不會特別限制用餐時間的關係，所以尖峰時段想來內用的話，必須要先在櫃檯旁排隊等待。不過這時候可以先看看菜單想一下要點什麼就是了，這裡覺得一個讓我印象很深刻的應該就是煮蘋果了，看著被關東煮湯汁泡得有點淡紅色與褐色的蘋果在湯裡面載浮載沈的樣子，一開始還真的看不出這是什麼，不過吃起來卻意外的非常好吃～

店裡面的座位有很多種，比較低的多人木桌木椅（甚至可以拿塑膠製的玻璃瓶收納箱來當椅子，超浪漫😂）、類似吧台的單人高腳座位區、還有多人聚餐用的高腳鐵桶桌。讓人看了覺得真的很有日本下町的燒烤店風格，因為自己在日本待過一段時間所以對這種氛圍還有裝潢真的非常懷念☺️。

食物的部分，我覺得最棒的是湯頭跟醬料，這兩樣對了，基本上配什麼都可以非常好吃，當然這裡的用料也是非常高水準，不管是菜的品質甚至是量都非常有誠意。那個茭白筍的大小真的是令我瞠目結舌，搭配上特製的抹茶鹽，真的是吃得非常滿足😚

週末的夜晚，喝著熱熱的關東煮湯頭、跟身旁的人開心的聊天，我真的是心滿意足🥰

非常推薦這裡～

🍢🍺","The well -known Kanto cooking shop in Neihu is located on Jinhu Road. There are a few barrels of large barrels of large Japanese sake, with a low -key sign, and a variety of wine walls next to the counter. Good place to drink (?!)

Because the relationship between dining time is not particularly limited, if you want to use it in the peak period, you must line up next to the counter.But at this time, you can look at the menu and think about what the main point is. Here I feel that one thing that impressed me is to cook the apples. Looking at the cooked soup by Kanto, the red and brown apples are raging in the soup. The sinking look, I really can't see what it was at first, but it was very delicious to taste ~

店里面的座位有很多种，比较低的多人木桌木椅（甚至可以拿塑胶制的玻璃瓶收纳箱来当椅子，超浪漫😂）、类似吧台的单人高脚座位区、还有多Human meal tall iron barrel table.It makes people feel that it really has the style of barbecue restaurants in Shima -cho, Japan, because I have been in Japan for a while, so I really miss this atmosphere and decoration ☺️.

In the food part, I think the best is the soup and sauce. These two are right. Basically, everything can be delicious. Of course, the ingredients here are also very high. Sincere.The size of the white bamboo shoots really made me startled, and with the special matcha salt, it really was very satisfied with 😚

On the weekend night, drinking the hot Kanto boiled soup head, and chatting with the people beside me, I am really satisfied with

I recommend this very much ~

"東湖的關東煮名店 #太鼓判 ODEN BAR，以特色日式食材關東煮、和美女老闆闖出名號，從原本的小攤車，到金湖路的大店面，還賣起燒烤和清酒，生意好到傍晚一開店就開始排隊了！

先排隊候位，再依續點關東煮、和燒烤類。關東煮的精髓在於湯頭，蔬果熬煮的湯頭口感清爽甘甜，喝完不夠還可加湯。

關東煮有蠻多日式食材，像是整顆蘋果下去熬的蘋果煮，還有鱈魚豆腐、高山娃娃菜、魚子福袋等。

不過最愛的還是牛蒡天婦羅，乾吃或是泡湯吃，都有不同風味口感，有海味的香甜，非常涮嘴。

店內的氛圍就是寬敞版的日式居酒屋，很適合搭配燒烤或熱炒，一夜干和炒烏龍都不錯，再點杯啤酒暢飲一下，頗消暑。還蠻多住附近的家庭客和學生，上班族下班後小酌的也不少。

The business is good in the evening As soon as you open a store, you start to line up!

Stay in line first, then cook at the point of Kanto, and barbecue.The essence of Kanto is the soup head. The soup with fruits and fruits is refreshing and sweet. You can add soup without enough drinking.

There are many Japanese -style ingredients in Kanto, such as apples cooked by the whole apple, as well as cod tofu, alpine dolls, caviar bags, etc.

However, the favorite is the cowboya tempura. It has different flavors of taste, and has different flavors. It has the sweetness of seafood and is very pouting.

The atmosphere in the store is a spacious version of Japanese -style izakaya, which is very suitable for grilling or hot stir -fry. It is good to dry and fried oolong overnight.

內湖關東煮名店也有日式串燒。因住在附近常到訪小酌。先到前台點餐再入座。座位有圓桌跟吧台。此次點關東煮溏心蛋，豆皮，菜卷，黑輪跟牛蒡天婦羅。關東煮湯頭為柴魚帶出鮮甜味，很清爽。 牛蒡天婦羅好吃必點。 另外點番茄沙拉，雞肉串（醬燒跟明太子口味）跟節瓜串搭配柚子啤酒。蕃茄沙拉整顆切薄片淋上紫蘇芥末油醋醬，外加上面點綴海苔。 一定要讚賞蕃茄沙拉，看似簡單味道卻不簡單。 醬汁微酸微芥末，再加上海苔融入鹹味，很是跟番茄合拍，另外值得提是擺盤精美。 雞肉串多汁外搭上醬汁跟明太子很香。,"Neihu Kanto Boiled Store also has Japanese skewers.I often visit nearby.Go to the front desk for dinner and then take a seat.The seat has a round table.This time, the cooked eggs, bean skin, vegetable rolls, black wheels and cow cowo.Kanto boiled soup head brought fresh sweetness to firewood, which is very refreshing.The cow's tempura must be delicious.In addition, order tomato salad, chicken skewers (sauce and prince flavor) with melon skewers with grapefruit beer.Tomato Salad split a thin piece and drenched with perilla mustard oil vinegar sauce, and the surface is decorated with seaweed.Be sure to appreciate the tomato salad, but it seems simple but not simple.The sauce is slightly sour and slightly mustard, and the sea moss is integrated into the salty taste. It is very good to shoot with tomatoes. In addition, it is worth mentioning that it is exquisite.The chicken skewers are sauce and the sauce is very fragrant with Prince Ming."
"女兒極力推薦的關東煮名店，才17:30已經需要排隊半小時才輪到我們。
日系裝潢，但我覺得太昏暗了！
關東煮、炸物、烤串應有盡有，清爽的湯頭，帶出蔬菜的甜味，請無限自取。
自製梅酒盛酒器皿優美，但酒就不如我自釀的。🤭🤭🤭
烤魚、炸雞軟骨都是我最喜歡的。","The Kanto Boiled Store, which my daughter highly recommended, only needed to queue for half an hour to turn at 17:30.
Japanese decoration, but I think it's too dim!
Kanto boiled, fried, and skewers should be available. The refreshing soup head brings out the sweetness of vegetables. Please take it infinitely.
The self -made plum wine is beautiful, but the wine is not as good as I brewed.Bleak
Baked fish and fried chicken cartilage are my favorite."
"生意超好的內湖宵夜名店，確定有位置後再排隊點餐(燒烤畫單、關東煮排隊)，價格稍高，三個人沒喝酒就點了18XX😂 店內氣氛很好，店員看我們在猶豫要點什麼還會主動推薦，而且推薦的都很好吃！

整體口味偏清淡，關東煮的湯很甜、不過鹹，喝完可以自己續湯，醬料也很不錯😆；當天幾乎菜單上的都點過一遍，基本上每樣都很有水準，不會踩雷！燒烤我覺得就偏普通一些，可以把預算放在關東煮上哈哈哈😂

😊📍特別推薦：(關東煮) 鱈魚豆腐、蘋果煮、福袋、溏心蛋。","Inner lake supper shop with super good business, after confirming that there is a location, line up to order (barbecue painting list, Kanto boiled queue), the price is slightly higher, the three people ordered the atmosphere of 18xx😂 in the shop. The clerk see us hesitating I will take the initiative to recommend something, and the recommendation is delicious!

The overall taste is light. The soup cooked in Kanto is very sweet, but salty. You can renew the soup by yourself after drinking. The sauce is also very good. thunder!I think the barbecue is more ordinary. You can put the budget on Kanto on the Kanto hahaha 😂

东 Special recommendation: (Kanto cooked) cod tofu, apple cooking, blessing bag, and heart egg."
"關東煮及串燒都好吃。

番茄沙拉擺盤很漂亮也很爽口，人很多，開始營業沒多久就客滿。","Kanto and skewers are delicious.

The tomato salad plate is beautiful and refreshing. There are many people, and it will be full after it starts."
"從年輕在路邊擺攤車吃到現在有店面很久，來吃過的次數數不清，還帶親朋好友來吃，總之就是很喜歡很常來。

以為之前做過評論都沒拍，只拍了之前沒吃過的烤皎白筍，沒想到沾粉是抹茶，非常特別，配起來無違和感。

關東煮幾乎都喜歡，湯頭很甜是用蔬菜熬的，很多人時會點炒烏龍麵，很Q喜歡。還有牛蒡天婦羅也愛點。基本上沒吃過難吃的，所以想吃什麼就點，都推。

老闆娘依然年輕貌美又和藹可親，之前帶狗來，老闆娘還幫忙安排適合放狗的位子，而且常看到老闆娘也在外場幫忙，完全沒老闆架子。

雖然價格偏高，但很舒服的環境，讓我想來就來，只是熱門時段可能需要排隊等待，可以刷卡，不怕現金不夠。","I have been eaten on the roadside stalls for a long time, and the number of times I have eaten is unclear. I also take relatives and friends to eat. In short, I like it very often.

I thought that I hadn't made a comment before, and I only took the roasted white bamboo shoots that had never been eaten before. I did not expect that the dipping powder was matcha, which was very special, and it was worthless to match.

Kanto almost likes to cook. The soup is very sweet and boiled with vegetables. Many people will order oolong noodles when they are very q.There is also a cow's tempura.Basically, I haven't eaten difficulties, so just push whatever you want to eat.

The boss is still young, beautiful, and kind. Before he brought dogs, the boss also helped arrange the seat suitable for dogs, and often saw the boss's help in the field, without the boss's shelf.

Although the price is high, it is a very comfortable environment that makes me want to come, but it may need to wait in line during the hot period. You can swipe your card, not afraid of not enough cash."
"太鼓判
曾在附近工作生活一段時間，還沒造訪前總覺得奇怪這家店沒什麼顯眼招牌，但每每到晚上總會有大排長龍的人潮排隊進而吸引目光。
ㄧ試成主顧時常和親友造訪聚餐，是我們忙碌生活消除工作疲勞的好去處。相隔多年這次與姐妹們約來附近飯店住，晚上當然首選就來太鼓判「解憂」一番。
餐點大致分為關東煮與燒烤，和另外廚房製作的餐點，店面有多種「酒精飲品」可以配，搭配美味餐點小酌一番，再配一些親友練蕭喂是人生一大享受～～
店內座位不多，環境像是韓劇裡面的燒烤店，排隊點餐是必然的，關東煮口味清甜，有很多市面上不是常見的，很特別 ，像是鱈魚豆腐就好好吃 口感細緻 白嫩白嫩的，在關東煮前直接點，另外也有可以點的菜單是燒烤類與廚房製作的，每一項都在水準之上，燒烤技術真的是一流，吃得到炭香，配上消暑啤酒🍻真的很讚！燒烤類我大推烤魷魚～～還有一定要另外點牛蒡天婦羅，越嚼越香～
整體而言環境舒適、氛圍滿分；其他餐點也都超級好吃，我個人是⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️大堆！
至於有多好吃大家自己來體驗吧！","Taller judgment
I have worked and lived nearby for a while. Before I visited, I always felt strange that this shop had no conspicuous signboards, but at night, there would always be a lot of people in line to attract attention.
ㄧ Try to visit and visit dinner with relatives and friends, which is a good place for our busy life to eliminate work fatigue.For many years, this time with the sisters, I came to the restaurant nearby. Of course, I would like to ""solve the worries"" at night.
The meal is roughly divided into Kanto cooking and barbecue, and the meal made of another kitchen. There are a variety of ""alcoholic drinks"" to match the store. With a delicious meal, it is a lot of enjoyment in life with some relatives and friends ~ ~
There are not many seats in the store, and the environment is like a barbecue restaurant in Korean dramas. It is inevitable to line up and order. The taste of Kanto is sweet and sweet. There are many common ones on the market. It is very special. Speak directly before the Kanto cooking, and the menu that can be ordered is made of barbecue and kitchen. Each item is above the standard. The barbecue technology is really first -rate. praise!Barbecue, I push grilled squid ~~ There must also be another cow cow macarolic, the more chewed the more fragrant ~
Overall, the environment is comfortable and full of atmosphere; the other meals are also super delicious. I personally ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ⭐️ A lot of!
As for how delicious you are, let's experience it yourself!"
喜歡關東煮口味鮮美好吃😋，小卷一夜干必點，明太子雞肉丸對不配酒的人來說略鹹，每次都搭了幾碗關東煮湯😃 …,I like Guodong to cook fresh and delicious. Small rolls must be ordered overnight. Ming Prince Chicken Ball is slightly salty for people who do not match alcohol. Every time I put a few bowls of Kanto boiled soup ...
"印象很好的一家店，平日晚上滿滿的人，完全不受位置影響，雖然不能預約要排隊點餐，但很快就有座位
菜單分成串燒跟其他居酒屋常見菜色，先劃完單再點關東煮，飯後再結帳
關東煮真的超 級 好 吃🍽️
沒想到蘋果煮那麼順口，不會澀也不會有不新鮮的味道，充滿香氣，是我的第一名
蘿蔔很入味，溏心蛋也好吃
關東煮湯很好喝，可以自己續碗
炸甜不辣脆度剛好，鱈魚豆腐入口即化
配上水蜜桃西打，吃下來滿足又不算貴，值得再訪！","A shop that is very impressed, people who are full of full night are not affected by the position. Although they cannot make an appointment to order and order, they will soon have a seat
The menu is divided into skewers and common dishes with other izakaya.
Kanto is really super delicious 🍽️
I did not expect that the apple cooked so smoothly, it would not be astringent nor a fresh taste. It was full of aroma. It was my first place.
The radish is very delicious, and the heart is also delicious
Kanto boiled soup is delicious, you can continue the bowl by yourself
The sweetness is not spicy and crispy, and the entrance to the cod tofu is about

"✨二訪
❗️不能訂位，需要現場排隊，用餐時間100分鐘

是很不錯的關東煮店
推薦：蘿蔔、鱈魚豆腐（外面吃不到的口味）、牛蒡天婦羅、蟹腳
搭配夏日限定的啤酒冰沙很消暑
雖然排隊時間有點久（週六晚上6:20抵達，大約等待30分鐘），但在東湖這裡仍算是值得一吃的好餐廳

有看到其他客人帶狗狗前往，看起來是寵物不要坐在椅子和桌上就可以帶來唷","✨ ✨ ✨ ✨
，️ Can't book a place, you need to line up on the spot, the meal time is 100 minutes

It's a very good Kanto boiled shop
Recommendation: radish, cod tofu (flavor that can not be eaten outside), cowbums tempura, crab feet
With summer limited beer smoothies, it is very summer.
Although the queue time is a bit long (arrived at 6:20 on Saturday night, waiting for 30 minutes), it is still a good restaurant worth eating in East Lake

When you see other guests taking the dog, it looks like pets don’t sit on a chair and table to bring 唷"
"怕人太多要排隊還沒五點就已經來這邊等了
可能期望值太高
是算好吃的，但是應該不需要專程開了35分鐘的路程來吃的店","I am afraid that there are too many people to line up and have come here before five o'clock
Maybe the value is too high
It's delicious, but there should be no need to open a 35 -minute journey to eat a shop to eat"
"北海道一夜干 大推🥰
烤串的速度驚人，而且熟度剛好！
關東煮的湯可以自己拿旁邊的小碗裝湯
我喝了好幾碗～","Hokkaido overnight push

"擁有各式關東煮的居酒屋
採先點餐再安排入座的方式
對於擁有選擇困難的朋友，真的是種考驗

干貝培根捲、酒釀蕃茄、明太子玉子燒、鱈魚豆腐、鹽燒鯖魚、炭烤牛肉串，都是今日推薦的單品👍

關東煮的湯，可自行添盛～
只是要注意店內其他人動線
店內桌子偏小，客滿時內用限時100分鐘
建議細水長流～內存都是清酒類
不喜清酒的朋友，建議自備或找別間😅

下班小酌怡情挺不錯，買醉不適宜","Have all kinds of Kanto boiled izakaya
Pick the way to order first and then arrange for seats

"週五晚上七點匆匆趕到，還好沒有大排長龍，幸運有位子。
點完關東煮再往後看就排了蠻多人。

一開始會先點關東煮，蘿蔔、溏心蛋、番茄、鱈魚豆腐好吃😋
可以免費加湯，拿碗過去就可以了

串燒表現一般，沒有燒烤香氣；
玉子燒有雞湯甜味，好吃；
酒精類飲品大部分都非常小杯，以居酒屋來說CP值不高

整體來說環境舒服，適合聊天
串燒能選擇的類型不多，表現一般
關東煮很讚必點
酒類還是點生啤的CP值最高","At 7 o'clock on Friday night, I hurried to arrive. Fortunately, there were no long queues, and fortunately, there was a seat.

環境很舒服，適合跟朋友來小酌聊天吃點東西，服務態度也算不錯，餐點可能花樣就沒有那麼多，不餓的話其實來小吃一些也是不錯！,"The environment is very comfortable. It is suitable for chatting with friends to chat and eat something. The service attitude is also good. The meals may not be so much. If you are not hungry, it is also good to come to the snack!"

"我只能說，關東煮一絕！好吃😋
自釀美酒也很好喝，然後梅子味的生啤有點喝不習慣就是了。
烤串也不錯，炒麵也不錯，總得來講是一個很棒可以吃吃喝喝的居酒屋，就算帶小孩來也有東西可以吃，小朋友應該超愛關東煮😆","I can only say that Kanto is cooked!Delicious
The self -brewed wine is also very delicious, and then the raw beer of plum flavors is a bit unaccustomed to drink.
The skewers are also good, and the fried noodles are also good. It is always a very good izakaya that can eat and drink. Even if you bring children, there is something to eat. Children should love Kanto to cook 😆 😆 😆 😆"
"以前餐車時常常會買 開店之後間隔很久 只來過兩次 是我挑食還是味道真的變了 沒有以前的好吃 原本想說四個人要吃 怕太少跟店員說關東煮有點的每樣來兩個 結果沒聽到 就算了 娃娃菜煮不夠久就夾給客人 我吃起來是生的！烤串覺得不夠香沒有恰恰的感覺 服務員講話都很小聲 讓我覺得我耳朵有問題😅
下次再來可能又是哪天忘記前次經驗時才會再來🤣","In the past, I often bought the restaurant for a long time after opening it. I only came twice for a long time. My picky eaters or the taste really changed. I did n’t have the previous delicious. I wanted to say that four people would eat too little. I ’m afraid too little. As a result, I did n’t hear it. Even if the dolls ca n’t cook for a long time, it ’s raw to the guests!The baking skewers feel that it is not fragrant and there is no just feeling that the waiter's speech made me feel that my ears are problematic 😅
I may come again when I forget the previous experience again. I will come again."
"傳說中10多年前紅極一時的內湖林志玲的店
用餐環境蠻舒服的，黑輪不算便宜味道中規中矩
這次點最好吃的是烤物，尤其烤蘆筍

整體來說店的氛圍不錯，食物也不錯可以回訪
唯一美中不足就是一旦變成了學生排隊店就不適合需要浪漫安靜環境的高端消費者","Legend has it that more than 10 years ago, the store of the Inner Lake Lin Zhiling in the red pole
The dining environment is quite comfortable, the black wheel is not cheap and the taste is quite satisfactory
The best thing to eat this time is roasted objects, especially grilled asparagus

On the whole, the atmosphere of the store is good, and the food is good to return to visit
The only disadvantage is that once it becomes a student queue, it is not suitable for high -end consumers who need a romantic and quiet environment."
關東煮一般般，塩烤手羽先又小又沒肉,Kanto is boiled.
空間跟氛圍還不錯，但食物真的普普…關東煮不夠入味，附近建議考慮內湖捷運站站寶島麵線的關東煮。串燒味道也普通，附近建議南港展覽館二館的板前屋串燒或鰻魚飯。,"The space and the atmosphere are pretty good, but the food is really Pop ... Kanto is not enough to taste. It is recommended that you consider the Kanto Cooking of Baodao Noodle Line of Neihu MRT Station.The flavor of skewers is also ordinary. It is recommended that the front house of the second hall of the second hall of the Nangang Exhibition Hall is skewed or eel rice."
關東煮種類多樣，味道清爽好吃。烤物香氣夠，價格略高。炸物也好吃，但價格也略高，整體氛圍好，食物美味，服務態度好。,"The types of Kanto are diverse, and the taste is refreshing and delicious.The aroma of grill is enough and the price is slightly higher.Fried objects are also delicious, but the price is slightly higher. The overall atmosphere is good, the food is delicious, and the service attitude is good."
很棒的餐廳，有分關東煮跟炸物，吃起來都不錯，超過6點就容易排隊，推薦雞軟骨，煮牛筋，炸牛蒡,"A great restaurant, there are Kanto cooking and fried objects, it is good to eat, it is easy to queue more than 6 o'clock. It is recommended that chicken cartilage, boiled beef tendon, fried beef gangsters"
"春天乎冷乎熱的

Favorite vegetables and cod
Suffering is full of soup is super delicious
Just add some yellow mustard to taste"
"關東煮愛店～ 白蘿蔔跟煮蘋果、煮番茄、福包都很好吃！沾酸甜的醬汁讓人回味無窮
除了關東煮外也可以點串烤、熱炒
晚餐時間去要稍微排隊","Kanto boiled love shop ~ white radish and cooking apples, cooked tomatoes, and blessing are delicious!The sour and sweet sauce makes people have endless aftertaste
In addition to Kanto cooking, you can also bake and stir -fry
Dinner time to queue up slightly"
碳烤火候掌握度還好，關東煮食材一般般，價格偏高，牛蒡天婦羅是炸物，但上桌是冷的，鮭魚飯糰包的居然是魚鬆。。。蠻詫異😅，環境寬敞，氣氛不錯，清酒價格合理，適合小酌，老店要加油了💪。,"Carbon roasting is okay. The ingredients in Kanto are average. The price is high. The cow's tempura is fried, but the table is cold, and the salmon rice group bag is actually fish pine.EssenceEssenceI am surprised, the environment is spacious, the atmosphere is good, the price of sake is reasonable, and it is suitable for drinking. The old shop is going to cheer."
"聽朋友同事極度推薦，第一次吃居酒屋體驗很讚
平日晚餐不需久候，上餐速度很快

兩人共點了推薦關東煮、大阪燒風味日式炒麵、明太子玉子燒、鮭魚烤飯糰、明太子雞肉丸、碳烤牛肉串

玉子燒非常軟嫩，內餡明太子鹹甜恰到好處~
牛蒡天婦羅完全顛覆想像，不敢吃炸物的我，不會感到油膩或重口味，反而咀嚼中帶有牛蒡香氣，一口接著一口還想多點幾份XD
朋友非常推薦日式炒麵，與在日本吃到的口味幾乎一樣！

這邊非常適合和朋友聊天用餐，但價位上偏高一些~","I listened to my friends and colleagues extremely recommended.
Dinner does not need to wait for a long time, and the meal speed is fast

The two of them were recommended to recommend Kanto cooking, Osaka -roasted Japanese -style fried noodles, Ming Prince Yuzi Roast, salmon grilled rice ball, Ming Prince Chicken Ball, Carbon Roasted Beef

The Yuzi burned is very soft and tender, and the filling prince is just right ~
The cow's tempura completely subverts my imagination. I dare not eat fried objects. I will not feel greasy or heavy. Instead, I have a beef -beef aroma in the chewing.
Friends recommend Japanese -style fried noodles, which is almost the same as eating in Japan!

Here is very suitable for chatting with friends, but the price is higher ~"

Kimchi fried oolong is very delicious and delicious
Kanto boiled soup is also great. I can drink it without adding it. I drink 4 or 5 bowls in a night, and drink infinitely.
Then, Kanto cooks a lot of special ingredients
Not ordinary hot pot ingredients in general Kanto boiled shops
Good shops worth visiting"
"使用線上外帶系統，點了泡菜牛肉炒烏龍麵，選了不要蒜跟蔥，結果來了這個？打電話過去問，態度也非常的差，講到一半還跑去跟別人聊天。既然店家有素食選項，可以直接再開一個欄位寫素烏龍麵，這樣不會有人誤會！
而且烏龍麵裡只有香菇大白菜跟木耳，沒有一個是敢吃的，而且賣$180！會不會太貴啊？其他食物也沒有好吃，真的是踩了一間雷店！","Using the online take -out system, I ordered kimchi beef fried oolong noodles.I called in the past and asked, and the attitude was very poor. I talked about half of the chat with others.Since the store has a vegetarian option, you can directly open a field to write a vegetarian oolong noodle, so no one will misunderstand!
And there are only mushrooms and fungus in the oolong noodles. None of them dare to eat, and sell $ 180!Is it too expensive?Other foods are not delicious, I really stepped on a mine shop!"
"無訂位服務
但是要先點完菜才帶位
這樣大家擠在門口不很阿雜🤔
店員都算客氣客氣的

位置偏少了一點
然後椅子配上桌子的高度
吃東西比較沒那麼舒服

同時有關東煮跟串燒還不錯
尤其是關東煮可以自己來裝湯
重點是湯頭蠻好喝的

價格上整體還行
但是調味個人覺得還好
雞肝串味道偏重 感覺生生的
櫛瓜要是能再烤一下更好
全部點下來比較喜歡烏龍麵（咦

飲料點了柚子西打 柚子味少少的

因為朋友大推這間 所以大概是期許過高🥲","No reservation service
But you have to order the food first
This is not very miscellaneous at the door
The clerk is polite

The position is a bit less
Then the chair is equipped with the height of the table
It's not so comfortable to eat

At the same time, the Dong cooking and skewers are not bad
Especially the Kanto cooking can be used to install the soup by yourself
The point is that the soup is pretty delicious

The overall price is OK
But the seasoning personally thinks it's okay
Chicken liver skew
It would be better if you can bake it again if you can bake it again

"餐點精緻美味
本來應該是五顆星
但關東煮吃到一半對一下餐單
發現少給兩個料
才跟店家反應
一開始以為鱈魚豆腐有上到
只反應沒有德腸
後來發現誤把油豆腐當成鱈魚豆腐
因為第一次去沒有點過
所以又立即跟店家反應
第二次反應感覺就有點不被信任！？
單價不便宜
在出餐上應該更加注意～","Meals are delicate and delicious
It should have been five stars
But Kanto cooks half of the menu for the menu
Discover two less materials
Only respond to the store
At first I thought that cod tofu had arrived
There is no ethics
Later, I found out that oil tofu was used as cod tofu
Because I didn't order it for the first time
So immediately respond to the store
The second reaction feels a bit not trusted!Intersection
The unit price is not cheap
Pay more attention to meals ~"
"座位很大 氛圍輕鬆 排隊人潮多
炸牛蒡、鱈魚豆腐好吃","The seats have a lot of atmosphere and easy to queue in the queue

The scent of the prince Yuzi roast eggs is enough, the roasted shrimp and roasted items are very delicious, and the stuffing of Kanto cooking rolls is solid."
朋友推薦來外帶，隨意點的大阪燒風味日式炒麵跟烤雞肉串真的都超級好吃！尤其炒麵是在台北幾乎沒吃過的味道，看似簡單但醬汁調味等都很細緻且恰當好處，迫不及待再來試試其他餐點了～,Friends recommend to take it out. The casual Osaka -roasted Japanese -style fried noodles and grilled chicken skewers are really delicious!Especially the fried noodles are almost not eaten in Taipei.

牛蒡天婦羅就算冷掉還是很好吃，再搭配著醬料👍

燒烤人多所以要等一下子，但調味十分好，肉質新鮮軟嫩😋😋","Good service, good atmosphere, good place at night

If you use it inside, you can queue first, and you will be arranged by the clerk after ordering ~
Kanto cooks directly. The barbecue can be drawn when queuing at the counter, and then hand it over to the clerk together!

The soup cooked by Kanto is sweet and delicious. The cold night needs a bowl of hot soup to heal the body and mind ❤️

Even if it is cold, it is delicious even if it is cold, and then with the sauce 👍

There are many barbecue people, so they have to wait for a while, but the seasoning is very good, the meat is fresh and tender"

"「暖呼呼的關東煮、香嫩的燒烤，填滿ㄌ冷冷冬天的味蕾」
從呱吉的美食廢人關東煮小店，到現在已經成為內湖人不可不來的居酒小屋。
第一次來，抱著很期待的心情，和男友從烏來溫泉結束後，咻的一下飛來。
暖暖的身體與冷冷的天氣，真的好適合來吃關東煮～
日式蘿蔔煮（$30）、高山娃娃菜（$30）、生湯葉（$30）
在關東煮中是吸湯擔當！一口食材，等於喝到一口湯，好滿足🥹
德國香腸（$30）與溏心蛋（$30）當成我們的蛋白質來源xd (有夠少
蟹腳（$25）很神奇，是有蟹殼的！第一次在關東煮裡吃到這個！但我吃不太懂就是了。
自從吃過一次之後就念念不忘的的日式鱈魚豆腐（$70/2份）！綿滑的口感，填滿了我的舌頭與上顎，超級好吃，口感很柔軟～
釜山魚板（$30）就是韓國布帳馬車會有ㄉ！吃一口就彷彿置身在寒冷的韓國冬天一樣，不然我平常其實不太吃這種魚板ㄉ🌝
然後！這次最讓我驚艷的是！晶瑩剔透的 神奇 蒟蒻（$30）！
QQ彈彈的咬勁，又帶點紮實的口感，很像在吃鹹軟糖XD好喜歡✨
另外也點了一碗小皿烏龍麵（$55），上面竟然也有蟹腳xdd！
以及一份炭烤牛肉串（$190），雖然價錢很高，但是真的很軟嫩！熟度剛好～
這間吃完真的會有暖呼呼的感覺(˶‾᷄ ⁻̫ ‾᷅˵)！唯一的希望是可以開晚一點～不然我下班再過來就都沒了🥲","""Warm Kanto boiled, fragrant barbecue, fill the cold winter taste buds""
From the cooked shop of Kanto, the gourmet gourmet people, has now become a restaurant for the lakes.
For the first time, with a very anticipated mood, and after the end of Wulai Hot Spring, he flew up.
The warm body and cold weather are really suitable for eating Kanto to cook ~
Japanese -style radish ($ 30), alpine dolls ($ 30), raw soup leaf ($ 30)
In Kanto Cooking, it is a soup!A bite of ingredients is equivalent to drinking a soup, so satisfied 🥹
German sausage ($ 30) and heart egg ($ 30) as our protein source XD (enough
Crab feet ($ 25) is amazing, there are crab shells!I ate this in Kanto for the first time!But I don't know it.
Japanese -style cod tofu ($ 70/2) that has been thinking about it since eating it once!The slippery taste is filled with my tongue and jaw, super delicious, and the taste is very soft ~
Busan fish board ($ 30) is that there will be a Korean -free carriage in South Korea!Take a bite, as if you are in the cold Korean winter, otherwise I usually don’t eat this kind of fish plate.
Then!What surprised me the most this time is!Crystal clear magic ($ 30)!
The bitterness of the QQ bullet has a solid taste, which is very like eating salted fudge XD. I like it ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨
In addition, I also ordered a bowl of small dish oolong ($ 55), and there were crab feet XDD on it!
And a charcoal grilled beef skewers ($ 190), although the price is very high, it is really soft!Kindness is just right ~
This will really feel warm after eating (˶‾᷄ ⁻̫ ‾᷅˵)!The only hope is that you can open a little later ~ Otherwise, I will be gone if I come over from get off work."
"關東煮的湯頭有柴魚香，品項選擇超多！
炸物烤物就一般水準，用餐氣氛還不錯，尖峰時段要排隊一下","The soup cooked in Kanto has a flavor of firewood, and the product choices are many!
Fried baked objects are generally standardized, and the atmosphere of the dining is not bad."
"造訪多次的日式居酒屋🏮
平日六點左右用餐不用排隊

牛蒡很好吃！
特撰燒雞串鹽味、醬燒各一串都很好吃
炭烤牛肉串店員有提醒趁熱吃，馬上吃了覺得肉有點硬，不是很嫩
大阪燒日式風味炒麵第一口吃味道不錯，但吃到最後有點小膩

結帳人員應該是老闆娘態度很好很親切～

再訪覺得對於四人用餐來說桌子太小很擁擠
餐都沒地方放了😂","The Japanese -style izakaya that has visited many times
Don’t line up at about six o'clock on weekdays

If the soup of Kanto cooked, it is not enough to add another
Niu Ji is delicious!
The specially written chicken skewers salt and sauce are delicious
The charcoal grilled beef skewers have reminded that when they are hot, they immediately eat it and feel that the meat is a bit hard, not very tender.
Osaka Burning Japanese -style Flame Fried Noodles The first taste of the first taste of the taste, but it is a little bit greasy at the end

The checkout staff should be the boss's attitude very good and kind ~

I think the table is too small for the four people to dine.
There is no place for meals."
據說是小有名氣的關東煮店，在寒冷的冬夜裡與朋友一起來嚐鮮，關東煮品項繁多，食材看起來都很新鮮誘人，每種都令人想來上一份，炸物跟烤物看起來也不錯，特別推薦烤飯糰，鹹香酥脆，唯一美中不足的大概就是價錢不是這麼的親民，但偶爾和朋友、同事在下班後小聚，是不錯的選擇~,"It is said that it is a small and famous Kanto boiled shop. In the cold winter night, I will try new with friends. There are many cooked items in Kanto, and the ingredients look very fresh and seductive. Each one makes people want to come. It is also good to get up. It is especially recommended for roast rice balls. It is salty and crispy. The only thing that is not enough is that the price is not so close to the people, but occasionally gathering with friends and colleagues after work, it is a good choice ~"
提供各色燒物、料理、飲料、酒類、關東煮以及快樂氛圍～每次來都是人潮爆滿，要排隊點餐，食材新鮮美味，酒水甜美沁脾，服務人員顏值都很高🤣最重要的是還沒有用餐，就已經被現場開心熱鬧的氛圍給渲染了，三五好友小酌和互訴心事的最佳去處～,"Provide all kinds of roasted, cooking, drinks, alcohol, Kanto cooking, and happy atmosphere ~ Every time you come, the crowd is full, you have to queue to order, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, the wine is sweet and spleen, and the service staff is very high. There is no meal yet, and it has been rendered by the atmosphere of a happy and lively atmosphere at the scene."

這間從以前是小攤販車的時候就開始吃了，老闆娘很漂亮，聲音又很像志玲姐姐，換到了新的店面來吃過好幾回，但都沒有拍照留念，這次點了基本的關東煮加上串燒，跟幾個好朋友一起吃份量剛剛好，湯頭的味道很清甜，可以一直去加湯，冬天來生意超級好，都要排隊排一下子，裡面的蕃茄和蘋果和天婦羅是必點的，外面很少吃的到這樣子的口味，現在又多了串燒的選擇，機輪谷也很好吃，再加上現場多樣選擇的酒類和啤酒，三五好友一起，是個非常適合聚會的地方！,"This has been eaten since I was a small stall car. The boss is very beautiful, and her voice is very similar to Sister Zhiling. I changed to a new store for a few times, but I did n’t take a picture. Kanto boiled and skewed, and the amount of weight with a few good friends is just right. The taste of the soup is very sweet. You can keep adding soup. The business is super good in winter. Macro is a must -have, rarely eats such a taste outside, and now there are more skewers. The wheel valley is also delicious. Coupled with the diverse selection of alcohol and beer at the scene, three or five friends Together, it is a place that is very suitable for party!"
"店家位在內湖金湖路上，靠近捷運葫洲站。店家為內湖人氣店家，非常有名氣。此用餐經驗為使用ubereats外帶。
店家提供串燒與關東煮料理，串燒都是吃食材的原味，搭配剛剛好的醬料。雞腿串燒雞腿吃起來軟嫩中帶的一點Q彈，調味適中，吃的到雞腿的原味又不會太單調。明太子雞肉丸吃的到滿滿的明太子，雞肉丸的味道也很棒。雞軟骨吃起來脆脆的，還帶有一點雞肉，吃的到雞肉的原味。醬烤白帶魚吃的到濃郁醬香味，魚肉吃起來很細緻，而且沒有魚刺，可以很放心吃。牛蒡天婦羅外圍考的脆脆的，中間的部分吃起來很扎實，天婦羅的味道非常棒，是來這裡必點的餐點。關東煮的部分表現得也不錯，湯頭有著濃郁柴魚昆布香氣，喝起來很順口，調味很天然。關東煮的料也是都有選過，每一樣都好吃。
店家提供道地的日式串燒與關東煮，適合當作晚餐或是跟家人平有吃宵夜喝小酒的好選擇。防疫期間只能外帶或外送，店家準備的外帶盒質感很棒，有機會一定會去店內享用。

關東煮都很好吃無雷，特別喜歡番茄煮跟鱈魚豆腐，可以加湯很棒，天婦羅也好吃。需現場排隊點餐入座，人潮不少。整體很喜歡，可以二訪👍🏻,"Kanto cooks is delicious. I especially like tomato cooking and cod tofu. You can add soup to great, and tempura is delicious.There are a lot of crowds of crowds.I like it overall, you can visit the second visit ，"

關東煮覺得魚子福袋最好吃，其他表現中規中矩，因為關東煮本身算比較清淡，沒有太驚豔的表現，湯頭不錯。醬燒豬五花和烤牛肉串重口味就覺得更好吃，沾七味粉和芥末都很不錯。柚子胡椒雞肉串也是比較清淡。起司鱈魚豆腐好吃，比一般的魚豆腐更嫩。,"Kanto cooking feels that the caviar blessing bag is the best, and other performances are quite satisfactory, because the Kanto cooking itself is relatively light, there is no amazing performance, and the soup is good.The skewers of the sauce and roasted beef are more delicious, and the seven -flavored powder and mustard are very good.Grapefruit pepper chicken skewers are also light.The cheese cod tofu is delicious, more tender than ordinary fish tofu."

服務滿分，玉子燒好吃，關東煮的湯味道不錯，其他品項偏普通，價格中上,"The service is full, Yuzi burn it delicious, the soup cooked in Kanto is good, other items are ordinary, and the price is medium."
關東煮沒拍到，都好吃 喜歡烤飯糰的朋友可以點看看，烤物不會太油膩味道都蠻乾淨的可以吃出廚師設計的巧思,"Kanto is not taken to boil, friends who like roasted rice balls can click to see that the baked items will not be too greasy. It is quite clean."

湯頭喝起來也有柴魚的甘甜
大阪炒麵也不遑多讓
Q彈的麵體配上萬惡的美乃滋

至於培根干貝燒、雞菲力串也都很好吃
尤其是後者，選用雞腰部的部位
一點都不乾柴，除了軟嫩帶香之外還富有湯汁
必點！

我當晚餐來吃花了五百多，也不算太貴(但我沒點酒就是了)

No firewood at all, in addition to soft tenderness and fragrance, it is also rich in soup
Must order!

All in all, this is a good place that can be able to talk about wine with colleagues after dinner or after get off work.
I spent more than 500 for dinner that dinner, and it is not too expensive (but I don’t have any alcohol)
And the items are not inferior!"
"餐點部分味道中規中矩，價格偏高
Uber eats串燒不能挑選，只有「經典七品組」可選，不確定內容物是否為固定品項。
分享這次拿到的組合是：櫛瓜、杏鮑菇、雞肉串、雞肉丸、雞軟骨、雞肝。大家要點ubereats自己斟酌（肝臟肯定非常多人不敢吃）。
另外，鮭魚烤飯糰的肉餡是魚鬆，是真-魚鬆，不是魚肉弄碎的那種

建議大家點外送需先上網查看店家的ichef 菜單，解釋比較詳細，不然外送餐點拿到可能會不如預期～","The taste of the meal is quite satisfactory, and the price is high
Uber Eats skewers cannot be selected. Only the ""Classic Seven Products"" is available. It is not sure whether the content is fixed item.
Share the combination you got this time: row melon, Pleurotus eryngii, chicken skewers, chicken balls, chicken cartilage, chicken liver.Everyone should order UberEats themselves (there must be many people who dare not eat the liver).
In addition, the meat filling of the salmon grilled rice ball is fish pine, it is real-fish pine, not the kind of fish broken

It is recommended that you order the delivery of the ICHEF menu on the Internet first, and the explanation is more detailed, otherwise it may not be as expected to get the meal point ~"
不管是關東煮還是串燒都一樣，食物雖然長得都像應該有的樣子，但味道都在一般居酒屋之下,"Both the Kanto and skewers are the same. Although the food looks like it should be, the taste is under the average izakaya."
"第一次吃是幾個月前被友人帶去衝去台北吃宵夜，結果吃過一次之後就念念不忘（尤其是柚子生啤酒🥺）
前幾天再度二訪～吃完覺得超滿足❤️

#泡菜牛炒烏龍麵 💸160
除了串燒跟關東煮，炒麵也很厲害！牛肉的油脂和泡菜的香氣拌炒進每一條烏龍麵裡～每一口吃起來都很入味但不會太油膩或太重口味～而且超大一盤不怕吃不飽👍🏼

#牛蒡天婦羅 💸30
這個必點！而且一定要一次點兩份才吃的過癮🤣口感不是屬於非常酥脆型，但牛蒡的味道越嚼越香～吃一口天婦羅搭配一口關東煮湯保證超舒服😌

玉子燒裡是滿滿的明太子～煎的軟嫩的玉子燒和帶有鮮甜味的明太子，兩個搭配在一起味道毫無違和感而且超好吃🤤","The first time I was taken a few months ago by my friends to rush to Taipei for supper. After eating it once, I missed it (especially grapefruit raw beer 🥺)

下班後的腦力激盪…總是要配點東西吃，才有力氣想😦 ～所謂的靈感嘛，總會伴隨著伙食一起現身👻

下班後的夜晚既然都來到遙遠的內湖，那就來吃吃看老張極力推薦的關東煮🍢跟烤物🍖，還聽說還有一位貌似林志玲的老闆娘～哈哈哈😆 但我沒遇到就是了（跟我桃花運一樣，難求）沒關係，山不在高，有吃的就好😏

這家太鼓判外觀算是半開放的居酒屋，一進去就可以看到前台滿滿的關東煮，可能是今天又冷又下雨，人潮並沒有很多，不然這一類的居酒屋～上班族還不來喝爆💥💥💥

前台選好關東煮就可以直接搬回桌座開始享用，而烤物跟飲料則是採填單點餐或跟服務員點餐的方式，稍後一會兒，店員就會逐一的上菜，不過！每次上菜都要跟我借明細劃單～這樣都會打斷談話😠 不過東西還算好吃～給過、給過✅

居酒屋難免會有喝醉酒的客人～所以，能喝多少就量力而為，不要過量，畢竟喝的適當也是保護自己也能尊重其他客人🍻

"餐點、服務都不錯

但座位實在太不舒適

千萬不要坐後面汽油桶桌面➕高腳椅的位子

（雖然前面矮桌的座位也很難坐）

這一區偏熱

桌椅的高度、間距，真的站也不是坐也不是

人均消費也不算便宜，用餐感受卻比一般小

吃店差勁👎，店家有沒有考慮改善一下座

位？還是客人坐得越不舒適，翻桌率越高？

生意極好 需要排隊

路過不用等太久可以試試","Meals and services are good

But the seat is really uncomfortable

Never sit on the seat of the gasoline barrel desktop ➕ tall chair

(Although the seat in front of the low table is also difficult to sit)

This area is hot

The height and distance of the table and chairs are really not sitting or not.

The per capita consumption is not cheap, but the meal feels smaller than the normal

Eat the shop is poor, have the store considered improvement to the seat?

Bit?Or is the guests sitting uncomfortable, the higher the table rollover?

The business needs to be queuing

You can try it for too long, you can try it for too long"
"第一次造訪，看錯時間所以開門前提早了30分鐘抵達，開門前陸陸續續已排了8-9組客人候位。
該店是先點餐後入座，所謂的先點餐指的是先點關東煮類可以直觀看到的餐品，至於其他燒烤、飲料、沙拉、盤菜類可以在紙本菜單上勾畫好後交予櫃檯人員，如果有需要加點部分也直接再拿一張菜單勾選後與帳單夾一起交給櫃台即可，不需要重新排隊。所在昨天在加點過程中覺得很方便迅速。
菜品與燒烤類方面，覺得自製餐點的比率比較高，所以可以吃到一些在其他店比較吃不到或不太一樣口味的餐品。
昨天三位用餐，人均約700元，大家都吃的很飽，有機會會再度回訪。","For the first visit, I arrived at the beginning of the wrong time and arrived 30 minutes earlier. Before the door opened the door, 8-9 groups of guests had been lined up one after another.
The shop is orderly before ordering. The so -called order refers to the meals that can be seen intuitively by ordering Kanto cooking. As for other barbecue, drinks, salads, and dishes. For the counter staff, if you need to add a part, you can directly check the menu and then hand it over to the counter with the bill. You do n’t need to re -line up.It was very convenient and fast during the additional process of yesterday.
In terms of dishes and barbecue, I feel that the ratio of self -made meals is relatively high, so you can eat some meals that cannot be eaten or different in other stores.
Yesterday, the three meals were about 700 yuan per capita. Everyone was full, and they would return to visit again."
"自成一格的日式關東煮，由櫃檯點餐直接熱騰騰端上桌，最主要特色就是湯頭不會下太重味精感，就是清清淡淡飄著一絲熬煮的香氣，讓每樣食材料理吃起來都不會覺得很有壓力，如此清爽實在難得。其中最推真的會流心的溏心蛋、蛋白甚至可以嚐到淡淡醃製醬料的鹹香；牛蒡天婦羅必點！其中較重口的品項，酥硬但卻讓人欲罷不能，尤其跟甜辣醬根本絕配；私心推豆皮捲，居然是使用嫩豆皮😍可知其用料的高水平～

除了關東煮、燒烤系列也絕對不能錯過，以菜單點餐形式選取，我們點了杏鮑菇實在Super Juicy！根本是爆汁、而且完全沒一般那麼難嚼；再者是雞軟骨，雖然烤得沒特別金黃，但同樣輕微地鹹酥也令人一吃上癮👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

總結是很忠實讓食材的美味自然表現的技術流餐廳、真的很下清酒或當宵夜～可惜只開到晚上10點多XD","The Japanese -style Kanto cooking is directly on the table from the counter to the counter. The main feature is that the soup will not be too heavy. It doesn't feel very stressful to eat, so refreshing is really rare.Among them, the heart -ups that are really attentive can even taste the salty fragrance of the sauce of sauce;Among them, the heaviest items are crispy, but they are unable to stop, especially with sweet and spicy sauce. Pushing the bean skin rolls privately is actually the high level of the tender bean skin.

In addition to the Kanto cooking and barbecue series, you must not miss it. Choose in the form of ordering in the menu. We ordered Pleurotus eryngii.It is simply bursting and it is not as difficult to chew as well at all. Furthermore is chicken cartilage. Although it is not particularly golden, it is also slightly salty and crispy.

The summary is a technical stream restaurant that is very faithful to make the delicious and natural performance of the ingredients, really sake or go to supper ~ Unfortunately, only open until more than 10 pm XD"
"被在地人帶來吃的美食，沒想到是網路上的排隊名店，每個東西都很好吃很入味，想知道一間關東煮店好不好吃，喝它的湯就知道了！！他的當非常甘甜清爽，配上它的獨門醬汁真的讓人讚不絕口！大推！後來去了兩三次吧
它的串燒也是大推","The food brought by the locals did not expect to be a queuing shop on the Internet. Everything is delicious and delicious. I want to know that a Kanto boiled shop is delicious or not, and the soup that drinks it!IntersectionHis should be very sweet and refreshing, with its unique sauce is really praise!Push!I went to two or three times later
Its skewers are also pushing"
讀實踐該店還在路邊是推車時就常來，搬家後少來，距離上次來也過了三年，關東煮依舊好吃，可惜不知什麼原因湯端上來時是溫溫冷冷的，烤物不是強項建議多留胃給關東煮，老闆娘還是跟以前一樣溫柔漂亮。老實講此次用餐體驗頂多3.5🌟左右5🌟給情懷，跟把此次體驗當個案。,"Reading practice The store often comes when the roadside is a cart. After moving less, it has been less than last time. The Kanto cooking is still delicious. Unfortunately It is not a strong item to keep the stomach cooking in Kanto. The boss is still as gentle and beautiful as before.To be honest, this dining experience is at most 3.5🌟 5🌟 to feel the feelings, and treat this experience as a case."
太鼓判 ODEN Bar 2023/4-沒有招牌的店家，以關東煮及燒烤食物為主，晚上5:30開始營業，不能預定座位，現場排隊時可先拿燒烤類菜單勾選要點的品項，在點枱面上的關東煮，由店家指派座位。,Taigan judges Oden Bar 2023/4-shops without signboards are mainly Kanto and barbecue foods. They started business at 5:30 pm and cannot book seats. When lining up on the spot The Kanto boiled on the top is assigned a seat by the store.
"> 特別餐點是「番茄煮」和「蘋果煮」，店家會把水果夾到碗裡再剪開，所以水果的味道都留在碗裡，和關東煮湯底意外地的搭~ 個人喜歡番茄酸甜的味道，喜歡溫潤甜味的吃貨們可以選擇蘋果煮

> 座位沒有提供預約，但座位數不少，進店會先在吧台排隊點關東煮，因此看到排隊不用馬上打退堂鼓，可以確認一下座位狀況再決定

我給五顆星並且還會再訪。","I noticed this one when I was still a small stall. I also watched a lot of food programs interviewed in the store and the beautiful boss mother.

Cod tofu 4, taste like a hard version of Shullele, the seasoning is light, you can try it if you haven't eaten it

3.5 raw soup leaves, which is the bean skin XD, the taste is a bit harder than imagined. If you want to eat a smooth and tender taste, it is not recommended.

Hokkaido Kunbu 3.5, the thickness is a bit thinner than the snack bar, and the unique taste of kelp is relatively lighter.

自己很少來到葫州站這邊，因著來這邊看醫生的緣故，剛好在附近找到了這家店，不論從關東煮🍢到燒烤，每一道都很有水準，尤其推薦雞沙浪跟特選燒雞串，味道不會太鹹而且多汁！ …,"I rarely come to Huluzhou Station. Because I came here to see a doctor, I just found this shop nearby.

"很適合冷冷的天氣來～～～可以吃關東煮又有串燒吃，烏龍麵的湯頭以爲和關東煮的湯是一樣的，結果沒想到喝起來有些微差不同，感覺得到店家用心～～雞肉的話比較喜歡鹽味～
非常值得嘉許的地方，就是點餐機制很意外的完善！雖然人超多，點餐台也只有一個，可是排隊下來完全不會有覺得不順或不便的地方！要加湯、要結帳也是回去找關東煮師傅，他可以應付現場關東煮客人、又可以加現場客的湯和結帳這點我真的蠻嚇到的！！","It is very suitable for cold weather ~~~ You can eat Kanto cooking and skewers. The soup of Oolong noodles thinks the same soup with Kanto. As a result, I did not expect that it was a little different. I prefer salt flavor ~

The oolong series is delicious but a bit salty"
"初體驗，特別的點餐方式，得先排隊點關東煮才取得座位安排，再點烤物。
烤物比關東煮好吃，但是關東煮湯可以自取無限♾️
試了日本的柚子和葡萄汽水，推柚子，但是下次都不會再點。","In the initial experience, the special order of ordering, you must first queue up to cook the seats before getting the seat arrangement, and then order to bake.
Bake is delicious than Kanto, but Kanto boiled soup can be taken from unlimited ♾️
Try Japanese grapefruit and grape soda, push grapefruit, but will not order again next time."
關東煮湯頭很清爽，天使紅蝦很大隻新鮮，牛肉烤的也不錯，玉子燒超棒，結帳的作業流程可以再改善，後面鐵桶座位區冷氣不強用餐喝湯感覺熱。,"Kanto boiled soup is very refreshing, the angel red shrimp is very fresh, and the beef roast is also good. Yuzi burn is superb. The operation process of the checkout can be improved."
"美麗親切的闆娘，有效率忙而不亂的點餐方式，用餐空間寬敞舒適，食材也極盡用心處理，但。。。不是每道菜或串燒的味道都那麼豐富道地，有時感覺太偏清淡。但整體而言，是個理想的用餐環境。
推薦： 柚子生啤酒","The beautiful and friendly Ban Niang, the way to order a meal with a busy but not messy, the room for meals is spacious and comfortable, and the ingredients are also very careful, but.EssenceEssenceIt is not so rich in the taste of every dish or skewers, and sometimes it feels too light.But overall, it is an ideal dining environment.

"氣氛很好的關東煮店，老闆娘相當客氣有禮；我們在開店前15分鐘就先來等候，可以避免大排長龍～

店內除了直接點的關東煮之外，也有其他烤物炸物主食等，不知道是不是因為前幾組入店的關係，一路上菜速度很快很順暢，讚讚！

關東煮有蠻多特殊菜色，蘋果煮、菜捲、蛋丸都好吃～湯頭也非常自然鮮甜，沒有太多人工添加的感覺；柚子胡椒烤雞串很美味，其他道料理表現也有中上水準！ 配上一杯清爽的柚子生啤，很舒服！","The atmosphere of the Kanto Cooking Store, the boss is quite polite; we will wait 15 minutes before opening the store to avoid the long queues.

In addition to the directly cooked Kanto cooking, there are other staple staple foods of roasted and fried objects. I do n’t know if it ’s because of the relationship between the previous groups.

There are many special dishes in Kanto. Apple cooking, vegetable rolls, and egg balls are delicious ~ The soup is also very natural and sweet, and there is not much artificially added; grapefruit pepper grilled chicken skewers are delicious, and other cuisine performance also has medium and upper levels. IntersectionIt is very comfortable with a cup of refreshing grapefruit raw beer!"
關東煮跟串燒都非常好吃，願意控制價格的話其實200內就可以吃很飽了。店內裝潢美觀，位置也多，很適合在晚上與朋友聚餐聊天。冬天的時候，關東煮沾點辣醬配上熱熱的湯，真的是爽快。個人私推烤飯糰XD。,"Kanto cooking and skewers are very delicious. If you are willing to control the price, you can actually eat it in 200.The interior of the store is beautiful and has a lot of location. It is very suitable for meals to chat with friends at night.In winter, Kanto cooks hot sauce with hot soup, which is really refreshing.Personal privately baked rice ball XD."
開的很晚，晚上人也不少但不用等，關東煮好吃，推薦旗魚，另外還有串燒也不錯，但豬肉有點柴，飯糰也還好,"It opened very late, there are a lot of people at night, but you don't have to wait. Kanto is delicious. It is recommended to cook flagfish. In addition, there are skewers."
"在門外排隊時先勾點好菜單, 輪到時交出菜單, 然後現點關東煮, 就座後勾選的菜和現點的關東煮會送過來. 不貴, 好吃.","When lining up outside the door, first hook up the menu, hand over the menu when it is turn, and then cooked at Kanto, and the dishes that are checked after the seat and the current Kanto cooking will be delivered. Not expensive, delicious."
店內氣氛很不錯，適合好友聚會聊天，關東煮入味，品項種類多，串燒好吃新鮮味道不錯，炸物爽脆不油膩。酒類選擇也多，店內的自釀梅酒濃郁香氣十足。一個人消費約600元。希望座椅可以再舒適一些。,"The atmosphere in the store is very good. It is suitable for friends to meet with friends. Kanto cooks and tastes. There are many types of items.There are also many wine selection, and the self -brewed plum wine in the store is full of aroma.A person spends about 600 yuan.I hope the seat can be more comfortable."
"台北難能可貴的居酒屋，最近的捷運站是葫洲捷運站，在金湖路上一家看似燈光昏暗的居酒屋，非常適合好友下班小聚聊天，沒有時間限制，而且餐點的部分很多樣，採單點形式也不會太貴，有燒烤類、清酒、沙瓦、氣泡類飲品，點完會自己送上桌，櫃檯處也有關東煮可以點，需自己端到位置上，內用的話排隊排一次即可，後續加點可以直接跟櫃台說不用重排隊，這家店18:00開門，還沒開門外面就會排隊了，依照我食用的經驗我內用18:00-22:00隊伍沒有停過，生意真的很好，可能是在內湖的關係也很多外國人會前來用餐，排隊的不少人是來外帶回家吃
關東煮的部分非常推薦他們家獨特的「蘋果煮」，應該是因為蘋果本身就好吃，也不會被湯頭蓋住水果甜！關東煮的湯還可以自己去櫃檯續裝喔
結帳的部分可以刷卡及付現很方便～而且也沒有再多收服務費！
廁所的部分也很乾淨，還很貼心有提供酒精噴瓶
服務人員更是沒話說，每個服務都很周到而且講話很有禮貌，在這邊用餐真的非常舒服，餐點又好吃！","The valuable izakaya in Taipei. The nearest MRT station is Hulin MRT Station. On the Jinhu Road, a seemingly dimly lit izakaya is very suitable for friends to chat from work. There is no time limit, and there are a lot of meals. The single -point form will not be too expensive. There are barbecue, sake, sandwater, and bubble drinks. You will send it to the table by yourself. You can also order it at the counter. Then, you can directly add points to the counter that you do n’t need to wait in line. This shop opens the door at 18:00, and it will line up without opening the door. According to the experience I eat, I use 18: 00-22: 00 teams in the inside. The business is really good. It may be that many foreigners in Neihu will come to dine. Many people who line up come home to eat outside for eating.
The Kanto cooking part is recommended that their unique ""apple cooking"" should be because the Apple itself is delicious, and it will not be covered with the sweetness of the fruit!The soup cooked in Kanto can also go to the counter to be installed by itself
The check -in part can be swiped and paid very convenient ~ and there is no more service fee!
The toilet part is also very clean, and it is very intimately provided with alcohol spray bottle
The service staff is nothing to say. Each service is very thoughtful and polite. The meal here is really comfortable, and the meal is delicious!"
櫻花蝦炒高麗菜夠蝦，關東煮不錯吃，明太子雞肉丸好吃，但是老闆娘會一直趕人，是無法跟三五好友久坐的場所（除非你一直加點,"Sakura shrimp fried Gaolica enough shrimp, Kanto cooks well, Mingzi chicken balls are delicious, but the boss will always catch people, and it is not a place where the three or five friends can sit for a long time (unless you keep adding some"
關東煮和烤物都蠻好吃，推關東煮的溏心蛋，烤物的醬燒五花肉、烤中卷、炸雞軟骨，以及唐揚炸雞，價位也可接受，本來會給五顆星的，但這次用餐到一半，因還有人候位，店員來詢問是否還要加點，若沒有的話需要請我們先離開了，整個感覺不是很好，明明沒有用餐時間限制，居酒屋不就是吃飯喝酒聊天的地方嗎，因為我們東西都吃完了就趕我們走？,"Kanto cooking and roasted objects are quite delicious. Push the heart of the cooked puppets, roasted pork belly, grilled rolls, fried chicken cartilage, and Tang Yang fried chicken. The price can also be accepted. However, this time the meal is half, because there are still people waiting, the clerk will ask if you want to add something. If not, we need to ask us to leave first. The whole feeling is not very good. There is no meal time limit. Is it a place, because we have rushed us to leave because of our things?"
好吃的串燒跟關東煮～很多異國飲料及酒精飲料，適合下班小聚一番，價格偏高一些,The delicious skewers are boiled with Kanto ~ Many exotic drinks and alcoholic beverages are suitable for small gathering off work. The price is higher
"排隊名店
老闆娘人超級好
且味道沒問題
但真的要等蠻久的
價格就如一般居酒屋
自釀梅酒蠻甜的  個人覺得
沒什麼負面感覺","Queuing shop
The boss is super good
And the taste is no problem
But I really have to wait for a long time
The price is like a normal izakaya
Self -brewed plum wine is quite sweet
Nothing negative feelings"
"食材多樣新鮮好吃，有道地日本的口味
價格合理！
早點到就不會很多人，三五好友糾來一起可點些日本清酒來小酌暢聊～
環境也是日本風格，讚！","The ingredients are diverse and delicious, and the taste of Japan
Reasonable price!
There will be no many people early when you get it. Three or five friends can make some Japanese sake to talk about it ~
The environment is also Japanese style, praise!"
"以關東煮起家的日式串燒店
平日下班後各種客人絡繹不絕
關東煮非常好吃湯也可以一直續用
串燒好吃但不是味道會印象深刻的類型
下次可以再試試更多口味","The Japanese -style skewed shop that started with Kanto
After get off work on weekdays, various guests are endless
Kanto cooking is very delicious soup and can be used all the time
The skewers are delicious but not the type of impressive taste
You can try more flavors next time"
"現場排隊，要先點餐才能入座，但可以用餐中途再加點，用餐完付款

推薦唐揚雞、柚子生啤酒、明太子雞肉丸
關東煮味道偏清淡，有沾醬（可辣）

適合三五好友小酌，是氣氛輕鬆的一家小店","Line in line on the spot, you need to order meals before you can take a seat, but you can add some meals and add some, pay after dining

Recommend Tang Yang chicken, grapefruit raw beer, and Ming Prince Chicken Ball
The taste of Kanto is light, and there is dipping sauce (spicy)

Suitable for three or five friends to drink, it is a small shop with a relaxed atmosphere"
"環境氣氛不錯，關東煮的湯可以自行再去櫃檯補。
燒烤類的CP值就很低，會選擇去比較專門的居酒屋。","The environment atmosphere is good. The soup cooked by Kanto can go to the counter to make up.
The CP value of the barbecue is very low, and you will choose to go to a more special izakaya."
"二訪，東西一樣好吃，附近停車也方便
生意很好人很多，在現場就按照順序排隊等點餐

關東煮湯底不會太鹹，我們點的每樣東西都蠻好吃的，而且隔一陣子去也會有新菜色；沾醬的芥末好吃，辣椒也香辣

烤物略鹹，但燒烤的香氣很濃厚，配七味粉吃很棒

鮭魚烤飯糰覺得內餡很少，鍋巴偏多比較黏牙；相較之下，泡菜炒烏龍比較好吃一些

唯二不喜歡的地方是：

1. 高腳椅很不好坐，地板凹凸不平，椅子很難放正，而且椅子太高然後腳會卡到桌子，導致人會離食物比較遠

2. 戴眼鏡的女服務生很不會送餐，你需要在她正前方清出一個區塊，她才有辦法把餐點放下來（明明就可以先把一個空盤放到她手上只有一個餐點的托盤中，再把那份餐點放下來，但她會端著那份餐點愣在那裡；或是已經幫她清出她左手邊的區塊了，但她一樣不會送餐，妳就不能伸長手放到左邊或是走兩步讓這個空出來的區塊在你的正前方嗎= =？）","The second visit, the things are as delicious, it is convenient to park nearby
There are a lot of good business.

Kanto boiled soup base will not be too salty. Everything we ordered is pretty delicious, and there will be new dishes for a while;

The grill is slightly salty, but the aroma of the barbecue is very strong, and it is great to eat with Qiwei powder

The salmon grilled rice ball feels that the filling is very small, and the pot is more sticky; in comparison, kimchi fried oolong is more delicious

The only thing that I don't like is:

1. The high chair is very difficult to sit, the floor is uneven, the chair is difficult to put it right, and the chair is too high and the foot will get stuck to the table, which will cause people to be far away from the food

2. The female waiter wearing glasses can not deliver meals. You need to clear a block in front of her, so that she has a way to put the meal down (obviously you can put a empty disk first on her hand. In a tray of a meal, put the meal down, but she would be there with the meal; or she had helped her clear the block on her left hand, but she would not send it to her For meals, you can't stretch your hand to the left or take two steps to make this empty block in front of you ==?)"
東西好吃又新鮮，燒烤跟關東煮種類多，上菜速度快，但價格偏高，偶爾吃一次還可以接受。,"The things are delicious and fresh. There are many types of barbecue and Kanto. The food is fast, but the price is high. Occasionally it is acceptable to eat it once."
"從以前擺攤吃到現在開店已經十幾年，過去住附近常常光顧，即使後來搬走也常回來解饞，想要不排隊就電話先點燒烤再來現場外帶。
多年後的現在，庶民價位的關東煮小攤，已經變成中高檔時髦約會場所，關東煮價錢漲了不說，以前好吃的品項不見(成本高費工)，還在賣的也沒以前好吃了。不過相較於變成配角的關東煮，現在更愛串燒和其他種類豐富的餐點，尤其牛肉串和鹽燒醬燒雞肉串每次必點，喜歡喝日本酒的這裡選擇也多。
還是捨不得少一顆星，希望能改進菜卷和恢以前料好的關東煮，牛蒡天婦羅和以前一樣大又厚，希望能一直開店，我也會一直來消費。","It has been more than ten years since the stalls have been eaten now. In the past, I often patronized nearby. Even if I moved away, I often came back to solve it. If you want to queue up, you can call the barbecue before you come to the scene.
Many years later, the cooked stalls of Kanto, which are citizen, has become a mid -to -high -end fashion dating place. The price of Kanto cooking has risen. have eaten.However, compared to the Kanto boiled into a supporting role, now I love skewers and other rich meals, especially beef skewers and salt -roasted chicken skewers must be ordered every time.
I still can't bear to have a star, I hope to improve the vegetable rolls and the Kanto cooked in the past. The cow's tempura is as big and thick as before. I hope to open the store all the time, and I will always spend."
餐點好吃，整個氛圍也很好，不過可能地段的關係，價格偏高一點點，適合偶爾來打打牙祭。,"The meal is delicious, and the whole atmosphere is also very good, but the relationship between the location may be a little higher, which is suitable for occasional tolerance."
東西多樣，精緻有特色，現選現吃有彈性，老闆娘還是跟以前一樣親切服務，員工服務細心周到很親切。番茄切薄片，真是一絕有好吃，溏心蛋很讚，非常推！,"There are diverse things, exquisite and distinctive, and now choose to eat elasticity. The boss is still as kind as before, and the employee service is careful and kind.Tomato cut slices, it is really delicious, the heart is very good, very pushing!"
"吃了超過 10 年的日式關東煮🍢+串燒！
絕對是下班後三五好友聚餐的好去處

先排隊點餐/畫單，再由櫃檯安排座位
關東煮清爽美味！
個人必點生湯葉、鱈魚豆腐、蘿蔔煮、牛筋肉串、魚子福袋、娃娃菜，還有溏心蛋！！！（可惜最近缺好蛋🥚沒吃到😶）

串燒也好吃😋🍺
由於品項多，帶看官親臨點餐品嚐
總之，推一個👏🏻","After eating more than 10 years of Japanese -style Kanto boiled 🍢+skewers!
Definitely a good place for three or five friends after get off work

Line in line first to order/draw list, and then arrange seats at the counter
Kanto cooks refreshing and delicious!
Personally, you must order raw soup leaves, cod tofu, radish cooking, beef tendon skewers, caviar blessing bags, baby vegetables, and hearty eggs!IntersectionIntersection(Unfortunately, I lacked good egg recently 🥚 I didn’t eat it 😶 😶 😶)

Skewers are also delicious 好
Due to the many items, bring the officials to personally pay attention to the food and taste
In short, push one 一"
"算是意外進到這家店用餐，沒想到從食物到服務都讓人非常喜歡，未來也會願意專程來吃！

首先關東煮的湯頭是比較清甜的，習慣味道較重的人可以沾醬一起吃。最推薦鱈魚豆腐、蘋果煮、蒟蒻，吃關東煮必備的蘿蔔也燉煮的恰到好處，十分入味，在冷冷的雨天來上一碗，真的很滿足。

串燒的話比較沒有太驚艷的表現，每一道都算是規規矩矩。

最令人驚艷的就是日式炒麵了！味道完完全全跟在日本吃到的一樣，讓好久沒出國的我們一解對日本小吃的思念。炒麵醬汁不會過鹹，重點是美乃滋應用的非常好，讓炒麵吃起來滑順濃郁，會讓人停不下筷子。

明太子玉子燒搭配著蘿蔔泥吃也很療癒，玉子燒是屬於甜味較淡的，配上明太子，口感豐富味道也很不錯！

整體而言，非常推薦太鼓判給想聊天的三五好友、家庭、情侶，氣氛及餐點口味都非常好，我也會為了炒麵再次回訪，重溫這個超道地的日本口味！","It was unexpectedly entering this shop for dining. I did not expect that from food to service, people are very favorite, and they will also be willing to eat in the future!

First of all, the soup cooked by Kanto is relatively sweet. People with heavier habits can eat sauce together.The most recommended cod tofu, apple cooking, and crickets. The necessary radish necessary for eating Guan Dong to cook is also stewed just right. It is very delicious. It is really satisfying to get a bowl on a cold rainy day.

There is no amazing performance for skewers, and each way is considered regular.

The most amazing thing is Japanese -style fried noodles!The taste is exactly the same as eating in Japan, so that we have not been able to go abroad for a long time to solve the thoughts of Japanese snacks.The fried noodle sauce will not be too salty. The point is that the application of Meiji is very good, making the fried noodles smooth and rich, which will make people unable to stop chopsticks.

The Prince of the Ming Dynasty Yuzi Bo is also very healed with radish mud. The Yuzi burning belongs to the sweetness. With Prince Ming, the taste is also very good!

Overall, I am highly recommended to the three or five friends, families, couples who want to chat, and the taste and meals are very good. I will also return to visit again for the fried noodles to relive this super -wide Japanese taste!"
"人潮蠻多的，建議真的想用餐，要多花點耐心排隊
雖然用餐的人很多，但是上菜速度不慢
明太子玉子燒大推，入口即化，濃濃的蛋香跟明太子直接炸開😂🙈
串燒也很棒，蘸上黃芥末，會停不下來
平均單價稍為偏點點高，但是值得","There are quite a lot of crowds. I suggest you really want to dine, and spend more patiently to line up
Although there are many people who dine, the speed of serving is not slow
The prince of the Ming prince is pushed, and the entrance is melted.
The skewers are also great, dipped in yellow mustard, I can’t stop
The average unit price is slightly high, but it is worth it"
湯頭自然鮮甜，關東煮好吃並且有不少特殊品項，自然無添加讓人安心。酒單及串烤的品質也很不錯，適合晚餐後來此續攤，服務人員品質優，美女老闆娘常常出現，親自服務顧客。,"The soup is naturally sweet, and Kanto is cooked delicious and has a lot of special items. Naturally, there is no addition.The quality of wine lists and skewers is also very good. It is suitable for dinner and dinner. The service staff is excellent. The beauty boss often appears and serves customers in person."
第一次來這裡，動線上讓人感覺是賣黑輪的（關東煮），價格上有點高，以關東煮來說，續點有點麻煩，再一次去前台才可以，酒又是單杯賣的=喝完一杯去一次再點一次，賣整瓶不好嗎......料理還可以，點了個茭白筍，讓服務人員拿個美奶滋，似乎很疑惑，可能他沒這樣吃過吧，燒酌種類太少，只有一種，是個敗筆,"The first time I came here, people on the moving line make people feel that it is a black wheel (Kanto cooking). The price is a bit high. In terms of Kanto cooking, the continuation point is a bit troublesome. = After drinking a drink again and again, isn't it okay to sell the whole bottle ... The cooking is okay, or order a white bamboo shoots to let the service staff get a beautiful milk. After you, there are too few types of burning, there is only one, it is a defeat"
氣氛很別緻的居酒屋，餐點樣式多元，適合朋友聚餐或約會,"The atmosphere is very varied by izakayas, how styles are styled and diverse, suitable for friends to gather or date"
"好久沒來的在地老店，今天店家介紹了一瓶清酒，配燒烤和關東煮很滿意！
關東煮的湯很清甜，熱熱喝很舒服，適合微涼的夜晚！","For a long time, the local old shop, today the store introduced a bottle of sake, with barbecue and Kanto cooking!
The soup cooked in Kanto is very sweet, and the hot drink is very comfortable, suitable for slightly cool nights!"
在內湖少數居酒屋形式的餐廳，兩個人消費大約1400元，餐點的味道還不錯，看到蠻多親子組合到店裡面消費，覺得最好吃的應該是日式炒麵，蠻有日本的味道，烤飯糰可惜的是飯本身沒什麼味道，有點小失望，牛蒡天婦羅也算好吃，如果可以在炸得乾、酥一點就更美味。關東煮的部分，覺得湯可以再熱一點，關東煮醬料的部分，非常好吃！不過最讚的應該是店裡面人員的服務！90分！,"In a few restaurants in Neihu, the two people consume about 1,400 yuan. The taste of the meal is not bad. Seeing a lot of parent -child combinations in the store to consume, I think the best food should be Japanese -style fried noodles. It is a pity that the rice itself has no taste. It is a little disappointed. The cow's tempura is also delicious. If it can be dry and crispy, it will be more delicious.The part of the Kanto cooked, I think the soup can be hotter, the part of the cooked sauce in Kanto is very delicious!But the best thing is the service of the staff in the store!90 points!"
建議早點來，東西好好吃🤤老闆娘好漂亮，員工很和善,"It is recommended to come early, the things are so delicious, the boss is beautiful, and the employees are very kind."
不錯吃的日式關東煮及燒烤料理，中等消費價位,"Good Japanese -style Kanto cooking and barbecue dishes, medium consumption prices"
星期二晚上八點來沒排隊,Never line up at 8 o'clock on Tuesday
日式居酒屋，食物簡單美味，用餐氛圍很好。關東煮、櫻花蝦炒高麗菜、烤串、雞軟骨都好吃。,"Japanese -style izakaya, the food is simple and delicious, and the meal atmosphere is very good.Kanto boiled, cherry shrimp fried cherryfly, skewers, and chicken cartilage are delicious."
來了好多次，每次都維持一樣的水準，親切的服務，舒服的空間，親朋好友聚餐的好地方！日式炒麵好好吃！關東煮湯好好喝！,"I have been here many times, and each time maintains the same level, kind service, comfortable space, good places for friends and relatives to dinner!Japanese -style fried noodles are delicious!Kanto boiled soup!"
"東西好吃

冷冷的天氣吃好溫暖
湯也可以續加
但停車真的好難停哦😅","What is delicious
The boss is so kind
Choose Choose more in Kanto
Eat warm weather well and warmth
Soup can also be renewed
But parking is really hard to stop"
非常好吃的燒烤，關東煮，清酒，食材東西多樣又不擁擠，座位非常都特別與特殊，價位稍高但cp值高，絕對是你可以來吃的好地方,"Very delicious barbecue, boiled in Kanto, sake, ingredients are diverse and not crowded. The seats are very special and special. The price is slightly higher but the CP value is high. It is definitely a good place you can eat."
關東煮食材跟湯頭不錯 串燒也好吃但價格跟份量的對比會覺得價格偏高份量有點少 坐位建議坐外面點 因為裡頭會太悶太熱邊吃邊流汗,"Kanto cooking ingredients and soup are good skewers and delicious, but the comparison of the price and portion will feel that the price is too high and the amount is a bit less."
關東煮、燒烤都很不錯！關東煮選擇品項豐富，湯頭好喝。飲品推薦奈良柚子酒、靜岡綠茶,"Kanto boiled and barbecue are very good!Kanto cooks is rich in selection items, and the soup is delicious.Drinks recommend Nara grapefruit wine, Shizuoka green tea"
食物好吃餐點多元。非常道地的日式口味。每個月都會來吃、假日生意很好要早點來排隊喔，,"The food is delicious.Very authentic Japanese flavor.I come to eat every month, and the holiday business is very good to queue up early."
老闆服務非常周道，店員也樂於協助。關東煮好吃多樣，串燒不錯，炒麵與一些炒菜類很入味，是一亮點！,"The boss service is very thoughtful, and the clerk is also willing to assist.Kanto is delicious and diverse. The skewers are good. The fried noodles are very delicious and some fried dishes. It is a highlight!"

關東煮很入味，湯也好喝。整間店的員工都很有經驗的感覺，從點餐、上菜、用餐的過程都不疾不徐，不會有吵雜的工作聲。,"Kanto is very delicious and soup is delicious.The employees of the entire store are very experienced. From the process of ordering, serving, and dining, they will not be fooled, and there will be no noisy work."
闆娘的氣質 依然是 東湖林志玲的水平 餐點 氛圍依舊 再者口感依然好吃清爽 美味啊⋯⋯,The temperament of Ban Niang is still the horizontal meal atmosphere of the East Lake Lin Zhiling. The taste is still delicious and delicious.

價位稍高，但味道很棒。
價位4/5
味道4/5","A good shop for nearly ten years.
Creative Creative Kanto and Japanese -style barbecue restaurants with very texture characteristics.

這間店應該是很多人的回憶，裝潢跟規模變得很讚👍！口味依然好吃！單價看似不高，但是都是小小份，點點點也花了不少錢😂，但還是一間值得一訪的好餐廳❤️。 …,"This shop should be the memories of many people, and the decoration and scale have become very good!The taste is still delicious!The unit price does not seem to be high, but it is a small portion. It also costs a lot of money, but it is still a good restaurant worth visiting ❤️.Mowing"
"吃串燒+關東煮。一人約500！
生意很好，距離上次吃4年前！","Eat skewers+Kanto cooking.One person is about 500!
The business is very good, 4 years ago from last time!"
來到這邊才發現是很酷的一家店，有關東煮跟串燒還有各種飲品，門口都在排隊，每樣東西都好吃，期待二訪😊😊😋😋 …,"When I came here, I found that it was a very cool shop. There were various drinks about Dongzhu and skewers. The door was lined up. Everything was delicious. I look forward to the second visit ..."
"空間不會太擁擠
串烤和關東煮都好吃
下次想喝看看梅酒
🫰🏻 …","The space is not too crowded
Bringing skewers and Kanto boiled are delicious
Next time I want to drink and see plum wine
🫰🏻 🫰🏻 ..."
全家都愛的店，可惜第二次去，點了烤中卷，從六點十分等到七點十五，所有餐點早已吃完，只剩還沒上，經多次提醒和詢問，店員一律說烤中卷需要時間，似乎變成我們是奧客。神奇的是，中卷需要烤20分鐘的話，我們用餐的一個多小時，還是來不及烤好嗎？,"The whole family loves a shop, but unfortunately, I ordered the baked roll for the second time. From 6:00 to 7.15, all meals have been eaten, and only left yet. It is said that the time for roasting requires time, and it seems that we are Olympic.It is magical that if the medium volume needs to bake for 20 minutes, for more than an hour of meals, can we not bake it?"
串燒價格偏高，關東煮的湯很好喝，生啤酒很好喝。已經來過很多次，小缺點是關東煮的菜單變化不大，如果能多加點不同的食材就更好了。,"The price of skewers is high, and the soup cooked in Kanto is delicious, and raw beer is delicious.It has been here many times, and the small disadvantage is that the menu cooked by Kanto has not changed much. It would be better if you can add more different ingredients."
"有關東煮就已經贏了一半！
關東煮好吃！
烤物有水準(炭火烤)
用餐環境乾淨清爽
還會想再來！","It has won half of the Dong cooking!
Kanto is delicious!
There is a standard of grilled objects (charcoal baked)
Clean and refreshing dining environment
I would like to come again!"
非常不錯的關東煮及烤肉餐飲店家 老闆娘 親切美麗大方 食物美味,"Very good Kanto cooking and barbecue restaurant owner owner's cordial, beautiful and generous food delicious"
關東煮跟烤物很棒，但烤飯糰完全不及格，飯完全是濕的、黏成一團、整體沒有滋味、鮭魚是用鮭魚鬆而不是鮭魚肉，賣65不如買超商御飯糰。,"Kanto is great to cook and roasted, but the grilled rice balls are completely failed. The rice is completely wet, sticky into a ball, no taste, salmon loose instead of salmon, and selling 65 to buy super -commercial rice balls."
喜愛清淡確美味的關東煮 親切老闆娘的招呼。每道都好吃 我是關東煮控 燒物也值得點喔！，每天生意都很不錯。晚上6點才開始營業喔！,The light and delicious Kanto cooks the hello of the boss.It's delicious every delicious. I am also worthy of the Kanto boiled and controlled roast!The business every day is very good.It will only start opening at 6 pm!
"還不錯👌只是想吃可能要營業時間開始就排好隊了。
牛肉串 很嫩很多汁
手工天婦羅 很酥脆 好吃 …","It's not bad. I just want to eat the business hours.

很多吃太快來不及拍了⋯⋯","From getting rich to now, the boss (mother) is still very polite ~
A lot of eating too fast, it's too late to shoot ..."
"氣氛很足，食物蠻不錯的店。
店內有多種酒類可以點選，食物以關東煮烤物為主。","The atmosphere is enough, and the food is pretty good.
There are a variety of alcohol in the store to choose from, and the food is mainly boiled in Kanto."
"很喜歡烤特選雞肉串！
吃過好幾家串烤，常常都會覺得醬料或是鹽給得太多，變得太濃厚太鹹，這裡的反爾會剛剛好，不搶過原本食材的味道！
關東煮的湯很好喝，很香！當然食材也都很好吃！","I really like roasting chicken skewers!
After eating several skewers, you often feel that the sauce or salt gives too much salt, and it becomes too thick and salty. The anti -offer here is just right.
The soup cooked in Kanto is delicious and fragrant!Of course, the ingredients are also delicious!"
"二訪！生意還是一樣好～
目前吃到最最好吃的關東煮居酒屋😍
湯也好喝～ …","Second visit!The business is still the same ~
At present, the best -eating Kanto boiled izakaya 😍
The soup is also delicious ~ ..."
常和朋友來吃，大推鱈魚豆腐，不管煮的或炸的口感都超好吃,"I often come to eat with friends, push cod tofu, regardless of the cooked or fried taste is super delicious"
"平日去等很久，位子不舒服
關東煮&串燒算中規中矩，但等了這麼久不值得
除了宵夜場&平日離峰時間可選擇來吃，其餘時間皆不推薦","Wait a long time on weekdays, the seat is uncomfortable
Kanto cooking & skewers is quite satisfactory, but it is not worth waiting for so long
Except for supper & usually leave the peak time, you can choose to eat, the rest of the time is not recommended"
"服務態度好，餐點好吃，上菜速度快。
水梨酒&荔枝奶酒很棒！","The service attitude is good, the meal is delicious, and the food is fast.
Water Liquor & lychee milk is great!"
"不管是關東煮還是串燒都是水準之上～
服務親切！","Both Kanto and skewers are above the standard ~
Careful service!"
"內湖知名的關東煮店
有很多特色品項
串烤、炒麵和牛蒡天婦羅也非常推薦

尖峰時刻會需要排隊
建議提早前往","Neihu's well -known Kanto boiled shop
There are many specialty items
String baked, fried noodles and cattle tinctures are also very recommended

The peak time will need to line up
It is recommended to go early"
東西很好吃，是三五好友聚會喝酒的好地方，很推薦，會在造訪。,The things are delicious. It is a good place for three or five friends to drink. It is recommended and will be visiting.
"內湖最好吃的關東煮 口味偏淡 可搭配沾醬食用 湯頭很棒 推薦牛蒡天婦羅 娃娃菜 野菜豆腐揚
燒烤部分中上水平 可搭配店內多樣的酒
另外推薦泡菜炒烏龍","Neihu's best Kanto boiled taste is light.
The middle and upper levels of the barbecue can be matched with diverse wines in the store
Also recommended kimchi fried oolong"
不好不壞 就台灣比較少有的關東煮店,"Not good or bad, just cook shops in Taiwan, which are relatively rare in Taiwan"
關東煮新鮮好吃，調味稍微清淡些，湯頭不夠可免費續，醬料使用黃芥末挺有新意，牛蒡天婦羅似乎炸好放很久，吃起來微冷又偏硬，是唯一敗筆，食材、環境、氣氛、服務等品質都不錯，相當精緻，也反映在價格上，適合三五好友宵夜聚餐,"Kanto cooks fresh and delicious, the seasoning is slightly lighter, the soup is not enough to continue. The sauce is very new with yellow mustard. The cow's tempura seems to be fried for a long time. It tastes cold and hard. , The atmosphere, service and other quality are good, quite exquisite, and reflected in the price, suitable for three or five friends for supper dinner"
推薦「牛蒡天婦羅」必點！芥末沾醬很搭關東煮，都很好吃。,"Recommend ""Niu Tuyou Time"" must be ordered!The mustard dipping sauce is very delicious with Guan Dong cooking."
關東煮的食材很新鮮，雖然價格較高但很多日本直送品質很好！玉子燒很好吃必點！環境很舒適放鬆，假日人多要排隊～,"The ingredients cooked in Kanto are very fresh. Although the price is high, many Japanese direct delivery quality is very good!Yuzi Burning is delicious!The environment is very comfortable and relaxed."
關東煮口味不錯，燒物水準也可以，價格中上，人潮很多要有排隊的心裡準備,"Kanto has a good taste, and the level of roasting is also possible."
關東煮真的很貴，湯也很普通，不過還算好吃，烤串豬肉跟雞肉比較喜歡雞肉的！,"Kanto is really expensive, and the soup is also very ordinary, but it is delicious. Baked skewers and chicken prefer chicken!"
"大排長龍的居酒屋
燒烤串 關東煮都很好吃
但價格稍貴 隨便吃就快破千","The izakaya of the long queue
Barbecue skewers are delicious
But the price is slightly more expensive, just eat it, just break a thousand"
從一台小卡車吃到一家店，朋友從單身吃到有兩個小孩，好吃又充滿回憶。,"From a small truck to a shop, friends eat two children from single, delicious and full of memories."
5:30開門時外面已不少人在排隊，有關東煮和串燒，唐揚雞很好吃，點了幾款雞肉都覺得很嫩,"At 5:30, many people are lining up outside the door. Regarding Dongzhu and skewers, Tang Yang chicken is delicious."
"季節限定綠竹筍，新鮮又美味。
冰沙啤酒🍻必點！
食材豐富，氣氛好。
是人氣名單 …","The season is limited to green bamboo shoots, fresh and delicious.
Swap beer！ must be ordered!
The ingredients are rich and the atmosphere is good.
It's a popular list ..."
關東煮及串燒超好吃，但鹽烤蝦不知道是過熟還是不新鮮，超級難剝殼，建議去殼後再烤應較好吧！,"Kanto cooks and skewers is super delicious, but the salt grilled shrimp does not know whether it is too familiar or not fresh. It is super difficult to peel the shell. It is recommended to bake it after shelling!"
"一直以來都很喜歡太鼓判、多次從三重搭捷運到此用餐
昨天去，第一次覺得餐點品質變了
烤物及炸物的部分，唐揚雞炸的很黑，櫛瓜、雞軟骨、豬五花都有烤焦
重點是我們4人吃完3個人都拉肚子
雖然不知道是不是餐點的關係，但希望可以回復之前喜歡的品質","I have always liked Too Drumming, and from the MRT to dining here many times
I went yesterday, the first time I felt that the quality of the meal changed
The part of the grilled and fried objects, Tang Yang chicken fried very dark, and the gourd, chicken cartilage, and pork five flowers have scorching
The point is that the four of us have diarrhea after 3 people have finished eating
Although I do n’t know if it ’s a meal, I hope I can reply"
"嗯食物在那個地段來說沒有特別覺得美味，但也沒有覺得難吃，但是對第一次到訪的客人很不友善，尤其是站在關東煮的那位男性，從頭到尾都不知道在不耐煩什麼，沒有任何文宣指引點菜及入座資訊，要通靈。
高的鐵桶座位應該是為身高180打造的，一般人坐那邊就是有一種沒坐穩會摔死的概念。
💰這五顆星是要給態度很好的送餐服務人員。 …","Well, the food does not feel delicious in that area, but I do n’t feel uncomfortable, but I am very unfriendly for the first visiting guests, especially the man who stood in Kanto. What is impatient? There is no text to guide or order dishes and seated information.
The tall iron barrel seat should be created for 180 height. Most people sit over there. There is a concept of falling to death without sitting.
要 These five stars are to give a good food delivery service personnel.Mowing"
好吃，但關東煮實在有點貴，克制點了還是要200左右，燒烤價錢就與一般燒烤店差不多。,"It is delicious, but the Kanto cooking is a bit expensive. It is still about 200 after the restraint, and the barbecue price is similar to the average barbecue restaurant."
人均約500元，有吃飽，只給三星的原因是1.用餐時蚊子不少2.炸物份量很精緻3.塩烤中卷送上桌時是溫的4.點的雞肉串燒一直沒送來，久候詢問店員表示送錯桌了,"The per capita is about 500 yuan, which is full. The reason for Samsung is 1. There are many mosquitoes during meals. 2. The amount of fried objects is very delicate. 3. When the roll is rolled on the table, it is warm. Didn't send it, for a long time to ask the clerk to send the wrong table"
"中等價位
關東煮湯有層次不會死鹹，
內用環境氣氛佳","Medium price
Kanto boiled soup will not die and salty,
The environmental atmosphere is good"
非常喜歡這裡的關東煮跟串燒^_^氣氛很好很放鬆,I really like the Kanto boiled and skewers here^_^The atmosphere is very good and relaxed
我喜歡在這裡與朋友和家人一起用餐。有各種各樣的食物和酒可以滿足每個人的需求。,I like to eat with friends and family here.There are a variety of foods and wines that can meet the needs of everyone.
"來探訪在口袋名單上的店～環境舒服乾淨，服務好，食物好吃，很適合朋友小酌。糖心蛋超無敵好吃，必點！ ！ ！真的是我吃過最好吃的糖心蛋❤️，培根幹貝串（兩串四顆）$150 也非常鮮美好吃大推👍🏻 醬燒雞軟骨$70味道跟軟骨嚼勁也是恰到好處☺️
跟朋友各點一杯白桃酒$150 好喝（雖然有點小杯🙈～整體而言非常喜歡，絕對會再訪👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Ps.號稱像志玲姊姊的老闆娘真的很美又溫柔耶 …","Come to visit the store on the pocket list ~ the environment is comfortable and clean, the service is good, the food is delicious, and it is very suitable for friends to drink.The sugar heart is super invincible and delicious, it must be ordered!IntersectionIntersectionIt's really the best sugar heart egg I have ever eaten ❤️, bacon scallop skewers (two strings and four) $ 150 is also very delicious, delicious, push -roasted chicken cartilage $ 70 flavor and cartilage chewing is just right ☺️
You can order a glass of white peach wine for $ 150 with friends.
Ps. The boss who is like Sister Zhiling is really beautiful and gentle ..."
與朋友一起享受休閒氛圍的完美場所。各種關東煮和美味的肉湯（可以無限補充）都很棒！美味的食物值得高於平均價格，但準備好在晚餐時間排隊至少 15-30 分鐘。,"Enjoy a perfect place for leisure atmosphere with friends.Various Kanto cooking and delicious broth (can be added infinitely) are great!Delicious food is worth higher than the average price, but it is ready to queue for at least 15-30 minutes in dinner time."
關東煮絕對是我迄今為止吃過的最好的關東煮之一。關東煮雖然湯底清澈清淡，但味道卻很好。除了關東煮外，他們還提供日式燒烤食品，如牛肉串、蝦、鯖魚等。你在入口處點了餐，直接從櫃檯挑選關東煮，然後就座。,"Kanto cooking is definitely one of the best Kanto cooks I have eaten so far.Although the soup base is clear and light, the taste is very good.In addition to Kanto cooking, they also provide Japanese -style barbecue foods such as beef skewers, shrimp, catfish, etc.You order at the entrance, choose Kanto to cook directly from the counter, and then seat."
和朋友一起出去玩的好地方。關東煮清淡，味道好，帶有辣味。烤雞肉串還可以，但他們的關東煮更好。他們還有清酒、不同的啤酒和其他進口的日本無酒精飲料。,"A good place to go out with friends.Kanto cooks light, tastes good, and has spicy taste.The grilled chicken skewers are okay, but their Kanto is better.They also have alcoholic drinks, different beer and other imported Japanese alcoholic drinks."
很棒的奧登燒烤美食。我想推薦魚肝，這是與日本酒精飲料搭配的必嘗項目,"A great Oden barbecue food.I want to recommend fish liver, this is a must -have project with Japanese wine fine beverages"
環境不錯，食物也很棒！放鬆的好地方。此外，這個地方營業到很晚，是夜晚外出的理想場所。我絕對會推薦這家餐廳！,"The environment is good and the food is great!Relaxed place.In addition, this place is very late, which is an ideal place to go out at night.I will definitely recommend this restaurant!"
溏心蛋、牛筋肉串好吃,Heart eggs and beef tendons are delicious
週末一定要早點來，因為在下午 6 點開門時間之前就開始排隊了。食物新鮮、美味而且價格非常合理。也相當適合家庭入住 - 我們帶著三個孩子 - 兩個坐在普通座位上，另一個坐在嬰兒車裡。牛肉和培根包裹的扇貝是必備品。,"We must come earlier on the weekend, because it started to line up before the door opening time at 6 pm.Food is fresh, delicious and very reasonable.It is also quite suitable for family check -in -we bring three children -two sitting in ordinary seats and the other sitting in a stroller.Scallops wrapped in beef and bacon are necessary."
這個地方太棒了。沒有多少地方同時擁有很棒的酒吧和烤雞肉串。這個地方是我去的地方之一。,This place is great.There are not many places to have great bars and grilled chicken skewers at the same time.This place is one of the places I go.
我第一次在農曆新年期間拜訪家人。與朋友/家人分享的好地方（帶孩子也可以）。餐廳還允許攜帶寵物。對於食物…CP值高的你一定會喜歡。我會帶我的朋友/家人再次拜訪。,I first visited my family during the Lunar New Year.A good place to share with friends/family (can also bring children).The restaurant also allows pets.For food ... you will definitely like with high CP value.I will take my friend/family to visit again.
我認為這裡是我在內湖下班後最喜歡吃舒適食物的地方之一。很棒的氛圍和食物。很適合認識朋友。,I think this is one of my favorite places to eat comfortable food after get off work in Neihu.A great atmosphere and food.Very suitable for knowing friends.
好吃的關東煮，幹貝培根捲第一選!,"The delicious Kanto boiled, the first choice of the scallop bacon volume!"
蝦子、雞肉和魚都很美味。  價格還可以。  不是很貴,"Shrimp, chicken and fish are delicious.The price is okay.Not very expensive"
這裡的食物很棒，但是吃飯的時候會有很多人來這裡！有時間的話就來嘗試吧！,"The food here is great, but many people will come here when eating!Just try it if you have time!"
食物不錯但價格昂貴。,Food is good but expensive.
"開放但環境比較差。

只需熱水煮，","Open but the environment is relatively poor.

Just boil hot water,"
老闆娘親切，東西好吃。明太子玉子好讚,"The boss is kind, and the things are delicious.Prince Ming Yuzi praises"
很棒的地方 可惜人太多 要排很久,"It's great, but there are too many people to rank for a long time"
可愛的地方，友善的員工，食物很美味,"Cute place, friendly employees, food is delicious"
尚可,Still
吃好幾年了，週末晚上依然大排長龍，老闆娘一樣漂亮溫柔，關東煮比串燒厲害，日本酒很多種，適合小酌一下度過開心週末夜,"I have been eaten for several years, and there are still long queues on weekends and nights. The boss is as beautiful and gentle, and the Kanto boiled skewers is severe. There are many types of Japanese wine."

鑑於有很多人排隊，我期待更多的東西。沒有什麼是高於平均的，但也沒有什麼是不好的,"Given that many people lined up, I look forward to more things.Nothing is higher than the average, but there is nothing bad"
聊天小小點心一下的好地方,Chat a good place for a little bit of snack
適合餐後小酌續攤，氣氛不錯，但生意太好，得現場候位，週邊不易停車。,"Suitable for a drink after meals, the atmosphere is good, but the business is too good, you have to wait on the scene, and it is not easy to stop around."
我去過那裡兩次，我喜歡他們的食物和服務:)他們還會說英語，讓我的家人了解情況。只希望他們的價格能降一點點哈哈,"I have been there twice, I like their food and services :) They also speak English and let my family understand the situation.I just hope their price can be reduced a little bit haha"
"食材新鮮 料理美味
尤其牛肉串跟乾貝培根
價位在燒烤店算平價","Fresh foods are delicious
Especially beef skewers and scallops bacon
The price is cheap in the barbecue restaurant"
好吃,tasty
"湯頭偏淡
不過豆皮生湯葉、乾貝培根、胡麻豬肉捲口味不錯👍🏻 …","Soup is light
However, the taste of bean skin soup, scallop bacon, flax pork rolls are good ..."
味道好，氣氛好，就像在日本一樣,"The taste is good, the atmosphere is good, just like in Japan"
好吃的廣東珠，我想就叫它。它就像鹵味風格的食物，但在肉湯中加熱。可以免費續杯湯。麵條也很好吃。,"A delicious Guangdong bead, I want to call it.It is like loquat -style food, but heated in the broth.You can renew the cup soup for free.Noodles are also delicious."
"關東煮推薦：鱈魚豆腐 菜捲
烤物推薦：燒🐔串 …","Kanto cooking recommendation: cod tofu roll
Recommended grilled object: Boiled skewers ..."

好吃的日式關東煮 好吃的燒烤 適合下班聚會聊天 老闆娘依舊漂亮,"The delicious Japanese -style Kanto cooking delicious barbecue is suitable for get off work party Chat, the boss is still beautiful"
奧登很好但不令人興奮。  烤肉很好吃。服務還可以，但是不周到。創新裝飾。   雖然價格昂貴。,"Oden is good but not exciting.Bakery is delicious.The service is okay, but it is not thoughtful.Innovative decoration.Although the price is expensive."
老闆娘漂亮，東西不錯，燒烤貴了一點，用餐環境佳，服務也很好,"The boss is beautiful, the things are good, the barbecue is more expensive, the dining environment is good, the service is also very good"
介於日本和台灣之間的小餐廳，相當友好和時尚，晚上或晚上喝一杯的好選擇。,Small restaurants between Japan and Taiwan are quite friendly and fashionable. Drink a cup of good choices at night or at night.

好吧，如果你想要一些普通（日本平均水平）的關東煮，這裡是正確的地方。只是不要像我一樣期待任何真正美味的食物。,"Well, if you want some ordinary (Japanese average) Kanto to cook, this is the right place.Just don't look forward to any real delicious food like me."
