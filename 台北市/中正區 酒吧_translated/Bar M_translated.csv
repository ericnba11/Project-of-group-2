"二訪Bar M
假日的低消是至少兩杯飲品，但還是整間客滿！

這次點了兩杯酒都超級喜歡：
▪️包種茶Fizz （很清爽甚至點了第二杯！）
▪️Oriental Sour 茶酒 (喝起來有side car感但又有香片茶的茶香！很喜歡！！！）

推薦！","Second visit Bar M
Holidays are at least two cups of drinks, but they are still full!

I like two cups of wine this time:
▪️ Packing tea FIZZ (very refreshing and even ordering the second cup!)
▪️Oriental Sour tea wine (drinking car feels but also has fragrant tea tea! I like it very much !!!)

"日本人開的小酒吧
坦白說我個人覺得不是太合格
首先一坐進來店內發現位子偏擁擠雖然店面本來就不大要創造出更多座位才能獲利這點我能理解  店內還有一個樓中樓得空間  坐在上面的會覺得天花板稍低  坐在下面的更壓迫基本超過180會撞到頭的那種  總覺得可以再優化一下座位配置
此外菜單設計的很不好理解
有隱藏菜單but QRCode又小又三個擠在一起想點還要思考要怎麼掃描
此外點了酒之後店員還會搞不清楚你點的東西有沒有然後會先回答你沒有再去幫你確認完回來告訴你其實有要不要再點？
此外很多外場人員但依然很常叫不到人
服務人員也常常搞不清楚你要點什麼但是這點就算了因為有些店員是日本人中文沒那麼好
餐點的部分挺好吃是加分項目雖然沒有炸物
酒類的部分其實坦白說沒有扣分可是並沒有太驚艷價格以中正大安的物價算一般標準
整體給人的感覺沒有到不好可是總覺得都差一點很不像是職人那種的日本人開的店不好意思我就不客氣的講很像是在日本開不了才來台灣
最後有一個極為扣分的地方  店家營業時間顯示為1:30打烊  店裡大概11:30人潮就明顯減少  店家大概11:40左右就開始收東西  這過程陸陸續續店員一直來東收一下西收一點東西  很像是在暗示我們想趕我們走要不要趕快離開  觀感不是那麼好  另外我們還坐在店裡  你營業時間寫到1:30  結果不到12點救災收外面的椅子打掃最後甚至關一部分的燈還關到我們頭上的那盞  我就想請問一下這是什麼意思？我們幾個朋友也不是只點一杯酒就坐到底不但點超過低消很多而且也沒有造成多大困擾不理解為什麼店家會這樣做  唯一的解釋是大家可能想早點下班  我得說如果真的想要我們今早離開或許下次直接過來跟我說你們要準備打烊了  或許會比我們都還坐在裡面就開始收東西關燈來得好","The little bar opened by the Japanese
Frankly, I personally don't think it's too qualified
First of all, when I came in in the store, I found that the seat was crowded although the store was not very needed to create more seats in order to make a profit. The more compression of more than 180 will hit the head that will always feel that you can optimize the seat configuration
In addition, the menu design is very difficult to understand
There are hidden menu but qrcode, small and three crowded together, thinking about how to scan
In addition, after ordering the wine, the clerk will not know if the things you ordered will even even answer you before you can help you confirm that you will come back and tell you if you actually order it again?
In addition, many outsiders are still very unable to call people
The service staff often can't figure out what you want to order, but this is not so good because some clerks are not so good in Chinese in the Japanese.
The part of the meal is very delicious.
The alcohol part is actually frankly that there is no deduction, but it is not too amazing.
The overall feeling is not bad, but I always feel that it is almost not like a Japanese who is like a job.
In the end, a very deducted local store business hours were displayed at 1:30. The crowd of people in the snooze shop significantly reduced the store about 11:40. It seems that it is implying that we want to drive us to go if you want to leave the view, not so good. The lamp is still located on the one on our head. I want to ask what does this mean?A few of our friends, do n’t just order a glass of wine, do n’t just order more than low, but it does n’t cause much trouble. I do n’t understand why the store will do so. Everyone may want to get off work early. Early leave may come and come directly to tell me next time you are ready to snooze.

山盛り！いくら丼（鮭魚卵丼飯）
這是一碗放滿滿日本產鮭魚卵的日本米，每天限量三碗；鮭魚卵清涼的感覺以及鮮味、配上熱呼呼且帶有嚼勁的米飯，在口中無論是口感還是溫度通通都是一絕，旁邊的山葵和醃蘿蔔也起了很強的提味效果，再度拉升品味的層次。

牛小排的口感極度軟嫩，輕輕咬就能把肉撕開，而其油脂感並不太強烈，不太會搶調酒的味道，反而起到了經歷酒精刺激的味覺校正效果。

【品飲】
麝香葡萄調酒有著鮮明的琴酒杜松子氣息，本來還感受不到麝香葡萄的氣息，當酒稍微回溫、以及吃了那顆清甜的麝香葡萄之後，就在酒中重新找到了那股清甜味。

Negroni剛開始喝的時候，柑橘氣息和草本氣息的表現很平衡，然而吞嚥後會回沖一股很強的酒精感上來；待融冰程度增加之後，酒精感變得越來越溫潤，直到成為宜人的樣貌。","【Food Notes & Taste】

If you do n’t look at the bartending, you do n’t find the sausage in the ordinary supermarket in Taiwan. When you go to the food, you can apply a little Bashami vinegar, which is very flavorful.

"點了一杯negroni，但喝了兩口發現裡面有蟑螂。

針對您所說蟑螂是從外面飛入這件事，您可以看見蟑螂是全濕的狀態，並且已經死掉，所以由外面飛進去的可能性很低。如果是由外面飛進去杯中，那麼應該會浮在液體表面，而不會是全濕的狀態，這個解釋說不通。再者，也可以調監視器確認，是否真如您所判斷，由外面飛入。

吧檯客人真的可以看得清楚杯中狀況？在店內的燈光還有客人有飲酒的狀態下，我很懷疑是否真的能看清楚。

前次造訪，貴店在沒有告知缺少原料的狀況下，出了一杯不完整的調酒。如若不是之前喝過，想必顧客是不會知道那是一杯不完整的調酒，在這樣的狀況下，是由客人告知商品有問題，然後才跟客人說原因，已經是不誠實的行為。身為一個光臨貴店次數不少的客人，發生這兩次狀況實在心寒，更無法理解貴店在第一時間的處理方式。緣分已盡，或許貴店並不差我們這一組客人，日後不會再造訪，言盡與此。

I ordered a negroni, but after drinking two sips, I found a cockroach in it.

Regarding your statement that the cockroach flew in from the outside, you can see that the cockroach is completely wet and dead, so the possibility of it flying in from the outside is very low. If it flew in from the outside, it should float on the surface of the liquid, not be completely wet. This explanation does not make sense. Additionally, you can check the surveillance camera to confirm if it really flew in from the outside as you judged.

Can the customer really see the condition of the glass clearly? In the lighting conditions of the store and the state of the customer drinking, I doubt whether it can be seen clearly.

On my previous visit, your shop served an incomplete cocktail without informing me that the ingredients were missing. If it weren't for the previous experience, I think the customer would not know that it was an incomplete cocktail. In this case, it is an dishonest act to tell the customer the reason after the customer has informed you that the product is defective.

As a customer who has visited your shop many times, these two incidents are really disheartening. I also cannot understand the way your shop handled it in the first time. We are now strangers. Perhaps your shop does not need our group of customers. We will not visit again in the future.

"藏酒豐富，價格合理，我想喜歡純飲威士忌或琴酒都能在這找到喜歡的單杯。

先是滿心期待的酒吧，卻是滿滿的失望（酒還是好喝的）。室外坐沒有置物欄，主動和店員要了一個，拿來了一個比自己包包還軟爛又扁平的置物籃（是垃圾袋？），帶位莫名其妙沒有先來後到的概念，希望可以對客人用心才不會辜負昂貴的低消！,The bars that are looking forward to first are full of disappointment (wine is still delicious).There is no staple fence outdoors.

因為需要低消2杯飲料 要花這筆錢了 還是希望可以入內 所以一而再再而三的詢問 店員才肯挪出一個靠牆的小圓桌給我們 剛好那店員所謂的5人座就在隔壁 看了一下 根本就是4人座再加一張椅子呢😊
臨近關店 空桌越來越多 看到比較大的桌位空了 希望可以換 得到的回覆是那桌是8-9人不能移動 然後到我們離開為止那桌都是空的

過去三年來過不下30次，是很喜歡的酒吧，但可惜的是老闆不在，或是平日的時候調酒的品質不一，一個禮拜內點同一杯酒喝起來還可以差很多，讓消費者很嘔，昨天點了一杯honey 獺祭gin fizz ，酒水分離，重點是在菜單介紹中含有米釀，而調酒中卻完全沒有，跟服務生反應後也未能得到改善，非常失望。,"It has not been less than 30 times in the past three years. It is a very favorite bar, but unfortunately the quality of the boss is not there, or the quality of bartender is different on weekdays. The same cup of wine in the inside of a week can be much worse. Very vomiting. Yesterday, I ordered a cup of Honey otter Gin FIZZ. The wine is separated.

日本老闆，威士忌跟琴酒選擇多。相較之下食物略顯遜色。推薦調酒或純飲。低消略高。,"Japanese boss, whiskey and piano choose more.In contrast, the food is slightly inferior.Recommended bartending or pure drink.Low low.",False
老闆的店內選備的酒很棒，很有水準，是相當適合純飲的店家，但相較於硬體上的高品質，店內人員的水平就有待加強。,"The wine selected in the shop is great, very standard, and is quite suitable for pure drinks, but compared to the high quality on the hardware, the level of the staff in the store needs to be strengthened.",False
調酒種類豐富，也有各式日本烈酒，從威士忌、琴酒到清酒一應俱全，是下班放鬆喝酒的舒適去處,"There are rich types of alcohol, and there are various Japanese spirits. From whiskey, piano wine to sake, it is a comfortable place to relax and drink after get off work.",False

調酒很好喝很有層次 風味特別 幾乎每個禮拜都來 日本店員也很可愛💜 …,"The bartending is very delicious, very layered, special flavor, especially every week, Japanese clerk is also very cute ...",False
還不錯的日式酒吧～調酒以日本酒為基酒，也可以客製調酒，但最好會日文，可直接和老闆(bartender)溝通。,"The pretty Japanese -style bar ~ Bart -ups are based on Japanese wine, and can also customize alcohol, but it is best to communicate with Bartender directly.",False

但還是優質
這陣子真的又下滑了一個檔次
老闆是日本人，可能中文不好
但這兩三年來其實也真的感受不到老闆的親切
可能因為前陣子擴店
老闆自己出來站外場
但是當老闆退出吧檯站在外場時
外場人力也沒有獲得紓解
因為老闆也不會去詢問客人需要什麼，就只是站在原地
反而是剩下的一個外場要顧更大的範圍
服務品質被稀釋，調酒的品質又下滑
連餐點都要等超過一個小時以上
（通常我跟老婆一入座點酒前就會先點餐）
讓我們可能下次去之前要先好好思考一下

還是很推薦各位前往

店的消費讓人感到難受，原本只想小酌一杯作為整個晚上的結尾，低消兩杯實在難以接受，喝酒喝的是開心，不是喝的撐死在那邊，幹嘛呢？換地方喝吧,"The consumption of the store is uncomfortable. Originally, I just wanted to drink a cup as the end of the night. It was difficult to accept the two cups of low cups. I was happy to drink and drink.Change the place to drink",False

日本老闆開的小酒吧，服務態度很好，酒類多樣，餐食部分也十分美味，只可惜如果你只會講中文，可能不太適合去。,"The bar opened by the Japanese boss has a good service attitude, a variety of alcohol, and a delicious meal part. Unfortunately, if you only speak Chinese, it may not be suitable.",False
餐點還行，酒也ok，但動作實在太慢，等到喝酒的興致都沒了，點兩份牛排也只來一份，初次體驗感覺不優。,"The meal is okay, the wine is OK, but the action is too slow. When the interest of drinking is gone, there is only one order of two steaks. The first experience feels good.",False

迄今為止，日本人在台北喝酒大多是在林森北路的商店，但近年來，像這樣在平靜的街道上營業的商店並不罕見。店主說：“我們很高興您能和他談談”，那麼為什麼不喝一杯並詢問他關於酒精的知識呢？","This is a bar operated by Japanese people, located in the direction of the MRT Guting Station towards the direction of Zhongzheng Memorial Hall Station.The staff are locals, but they all understand Japanese, so there is no problem with tourists in shopping.

Because the boss is Japanese, their Japanese cocktail choices are also very rich.The four -page menu is filled with cocktails, and you will be dazzling.

In addition, Japanese TV broadcasts on the counter seat. When there is a Japanese national team's football or other games, the bar is also a sports bar.It may not be a bad idea to cheer for Japanese compatriots encountered in a foreign country.

So far, most of the Japanese drinking in Taipei is mostly shops on Linsen North Road, but in recent years, it is not uncommon for shops operating on peaceful streets.The owner said, ""We are glad that you can talk to him."" So why not drink a glass and ask him about alcohol?",False

一家威士忌酒吧，有日本員工。日本威士忌有山崎、響、白州等多種。光是山崎就有超過 5 種不同年齡的類型。還有寬敞的桌子，可容納7-8人。我們的日本員工數量有限，因此您可以獲得友善的客戶服務。,"A whiskey bar, a Japanese employee.Japanese whiskey has a variety of Yamazaki, Xiang, and Baizhou.There are more than 5 types of different ages alone in Yamazaki.There are also spacious tables that can accommodate 7-8 people.Our Japanese employees are limited, so you can get friendly customer service.",False
這裡我收到了一套比較台灣蒸餾威士忌噶瑪蘭的飲料。店主是在當地居住的日本人，所以他可以用日語解釋各種事情。目前台灣好像存貨有限，所以價格有點貴，但因為可以同時享用幾種，我覺得還是很值得的。,"Here I have received a set of beverages that compare Taiwan's distilled whiskey Karma.The owner is a Japanese who lives in the local area, so he can explain various things in Japanese.At present, Taiwan seems to have limited inventory, so the price is a bit expensive, but because it can be enjoyed at the same time, I think it is worth it.",False

The taste was very interesting.The bar itself is a bit small, but it provides a variety of high -quality alcohol to choose from.",False
老闆親自走遍台北的各個酒吧，研究美味的雞尾酒。這是一家酒吧，您不僅可以享用雞尾酒，還可以享用真正美味的飲料，特別注重玻璃杯、冰塊和裝飾。,"The boss personally traveled to various bars in Taipei to study delicious cocktails.This is a bar. You can not only enjoy cocktails, but also enjoy real delicious beverages. Pay particular attention to glass, ice cubes and decorations.",False
由於他們的座位政策而失去了我們的生意。  想把我們塞到一對夫婦旁邊的一張小桌子上，而不是讓我們坐在我們想坐的空桌子上，因為它被保存起來，以防四人一組走進門。  更好的是手上有一隻鳥......,"Our business was lost due to their seat policy.I want to stuff us on a small table next to a couple, instead of letting us sit on the empty table we want to sit, because it is preserved to prevent four people from entering the door.The better is that there is a bird in hand ...",False
