有些會先炸過，是用烤爐烤的（不是用木炭烤的）看似二位年輕人創業開店，一般串烤的水準沒有特別的特色，尚有很大的進步空間，加油！,"Some will be fried first. It looks like two young people to open a shop with baking (not grilled with charcoal). Generally, there is no special feature of skewers. There is still a lot of room for improvement. Come on!",False
"店家說20-30分鐘好，等了40分鐘，看他考鹹豬肉，給我加辣，跟他說我沒有說要加辣，他說那他沖一下，還不知道怎麼剪，剪一塊瘦肉一塊肥肉….

我剛到看他在烤鹹豬肉，烤好我以為好了，他說還有魷魚，魷魚烤了不到五分鐘說好了

重點！店員還拿他工作手套碰食物，真的很沒衛生，建議大家三思…..","The store said that 20-30 minutes are good. After 40 minutes, watch him take salty pork and add spicy to me. He told him that I did not say that he would add spicy. He said he rushed and didn’t know how to cut it. One piece of fat ...

I just came to see that he was roasted salted pork, and I thought it was good. He said that there were squid, and the squid was baked for less than five minutes.

The point!The clerk also touched the food with his working gloves. It was really un hygiel. I suggest you think twice ...",False

"我是ㄧ位店裡的常客，因為近期比較忙所以沒有時間上來做評論，剛才突然想到正要進行評論的時候發現大部分都是好評不斷，但是剛才卻看到一則評論讓我有點傻眼感覺有點在毀壞此店的名聲，這是一則兩週前的評論，我大概知道是哪一位客人留下的評論，因為好死不死我剛好當天任在現場而且正在用餐。
是這樣的，當天因為店裡比較忙一些當下只有兩名員工且有點小忙，一位在裡面一直不斷地烤食材趕著出給客人，另外一位還要支援廚房出餐備餐跟招呼客人很明顯的已經忙不過來了，這就算了，突然來了一位客人（是男是女就不說了）點好餐之後到櫃檯結帳，因為烤手（員工）當下較多食材要烤（旁邊堆了一些）
所以另外一位幫忙那位客人點餐的員工就有禮貌性的告知客人說因為目前單量比較大所以可能要等一下大概20-30分鐘左右，結果客人當下並沒有問題直到…客人差不多時間回來拿餐的時候，店員也是很有禮貌的告知說還沒好可能要再等一下不好意思之類的，結果那位客人就不爽了那位客人覺得不是跟我說20-30分鐘嗎？（感覺就是講怎樣就怎樣的概念）
然後這則評論還有講到魷魚跟鹹豬肉的部分，這點我必須幫忙商家澄清一下，鹹豬肉這道料理我點過，它比較厚所以烤的時間後要比較久，但是那位客人執著的點是鹹豬肉要怎麼剪？怎麼切？說店員不會剪切？
我就想問一下了請問怎麼剪怎麼切很重要嗎？重要的是好不好吃跟並沒有熟的的問題而已吧？鹹豬肉它就有點像五花肉的概念，會有肥油跟肥肉是一定會有的，這位客人你如果當初要怎麼剪切可以先跟店員告知，事後在那邊放馬後炮甚至刁難員工我真的覺得說不過去，再來這位客人又對魷魚有意見了，這倒菜我點過而且很常點，有曾經觀察過店員是怎麼處理魷魚的，店店員會先清洗過，然後把一些不應該存在的東西要去除掉，然後直接剪開來變成攤平的，講真的攤平的魷魚就是薄薄扁扁的一層，很快就好了，而且他們似乎都用大火下去烤魷魚，我就想問了就剪開來攤平也就是薄薄扁扁的影片這樣而且，在那邊說什麼搞不到五分鐘就說好了？哈囉請這位客人搞清楚那個東西就是這麼快…並不是這沒有熟然後還出給客人，不然請問是要烤到太乾變成魷魚乾這樣嗎？再來這位客人還說店員用工作手套去觸碰食物很沒衛生，對啦的確是這樣，但是講真的廚房裡面已經忙的一團糟的時候到屁那位當烤手的人員哪裡有美國的時間脫手套？再來我也是都這樣吃也沒事啊…
再來我講真的外面很多串燒店很多的烤手師傅也許都是這樣的….那個是因為他們都在裡面你們根本不得而知，但是這家店並不大他們也不是封閉廚房而且半開放廚房，而且我真的覺得雖然工作手套的觸碰食材不太好是沒錯，但是我發現他們單量很多的時候基本上都是這樣，因為員工的工作手套一脫一戴的真的也是很花時間很麻煩，而且我有發現他們在很忙的時候幾乎所有的設備從頭到尾都是維持在大火的火力在烤食材，破百度的高溫對於員工來說是一件非常難熬的事情。不要想盡辦法刁蠻員工，而且等待的時間講真的員工並不會通靈，每一樣的食材都有所需花費的時間沒辦法完全保證要多久會好？只能給個大概，大概這詞看得懂嗎？
不要因為等太久就給人家負評，員工也是很努力的在敢出餐給客人，不然正常是要照順序烤，這樣你只會等待更久，看到評論真的很替店家感到惋惜，加油！我們常客會支持的！","I am a frequent visitor in the store. Because I have been busy recently, I have no time to make comments. I suddenly thought that when I was about to comment, I found that most of them were well received, but I saw a comment just now. It is a bit of destroying the reputation of this shop. This is a comment two weeks ago. I probably know which guest is left by the guests, because I was at the scene and was dining on the same day.
This is the case. On the day, because of the busy store, there were only two employees in the present and a little busy. One kept roasting ingredients and rushed to the guests. Obviously, it is already too busy. Even if it is, a guest (if a man is a woman or a woman, I won't say it), ordered the meal at the counter, because the grilled hands (employees) are baked at the moment. (Some piled up next to it)
Therefore, another employee who helped the guest or ordering told the guests politely that because the current volume is relatively large, they may have to wait about 20-30 minutes. When taking the meal, the clerk also politely told that it was not good to wait for the other way, but the guest felt uncomfortable that the guest felt that the guest felt to me for 20-30 minutes?(It feels like what is the concept of what kind of concept)
Then this comment also talks about the part of squid and salted pork. I have to help the merchant clarify this. I ordered the dishes of salted pork. It is thicker. The point is how to cut salted pork?How to cut it?Said that the clerk wouldn't cut it?
I just want to ask how to cut and how to cut it?The important thing is that it is just a problem that is not delicious and not familiar with it?Salted pork is a bit like the concept of pork belly. There will be fat oil and fat. This guest can tell you if you should cut it at the beginning. I feel that I ca n’t say it, and I have any opinions on the squid again. I have ordered the dishes and very often. I have observed how the clerk has dealt with the squid. The things should be removed, and then cut directly to become flattened. The squid that is really flat is a thin and flat layer, and it will be fine soon, and they seem to use a high fire to roast squid. I am. If you want to ask, cut it out and flatten it, that is, the thin and flat film, and what is said to say there for five minutes?Haruka invited this guest to figure out that the thing is so fast ... Isn't it that it is not familiar and then given to the guests, otherwise, do you want to bake until it is too dry and turn into a squid?Come again, the guest also said that the clerk touched the food with work gloves and was not hygienic. It was true, but when he was really busy in the kitchen, he went to the fart. Take off gloves?It's okay to eat it again ...
Let's talk about it again. There are a lot of roasted players in the skewers outside. Maybe this is like this ... That's because they are all in it, but this shop is not large. The kitchen, and I really think that although the touched ingredients of the work gloves are not very good, it is right, but I find that they are basically the same when they have a lot of single volume, because the employee’s work gloves are really very very worn. It ’s troublesome to spend, and I found that when they were very busy, almost all the equipment from beginning to end was the firepower that maintained the fire in the fire. The high temperature of breaking Baidu was a very difficult thing for employees.Don't try to do everything possible, and the time you wait to say that the employees will not be psychic. Every time the ingredients have the time to spend, it will not guarantee how long it will take?Can you only give it a matter, do you understand the word?
Don't give others commenting because you wait too long, employees are also working hard to dare to go out for the guests, otherwise it is normal to bake in order. This will only wait for the review. I really feel sorry for the comment. come on!We will support it!",False
