千層馬鈴薯好美，從中剖開真的驚艷！搭配酸紫洋蔥跟帶著起司味道的醬料真的好好吃！適合兩人分食，吃到後半部比較油膩。

皎白筍是今天最驚艷的一道！大推！

炸牛排三明治的牛排炸得剛好，不會太老也不會太生，嫩得可以直接咬斷。用切的也很好入口，女生不用擔心動手或是吃到妝花掉。

油封鴨腿是今天唯一不符期待的餐點，鴨腿肉老也不嫩，吃起來很乾柴。但底部的炒芋頭丁、毛豆、火腿、包心菜很好吃！

甜點檸檬千層也很好吃！

帳單用幸運餅乾送上桌真的很有巧思！重點是幸運餅乾竟然也很好吃XDDDD可以搭上檸檬千層的醬😋","There is a reservation in the evening of the holidays, and you can directly enter the seat after arriving.

Thousands of potatoes are so beautiful, and it is really amazing to cut it from it!It is really delicious with sour purple onion and sauce with cheese flavor!Suitable for two people to eat, and the second half is greasy.

Jiao white bamboo shoots are the most amazing way today!Push!

The steak of the fried steak sandwich is just blew up, it will not be too old or too raw, tender can be bite directly.The cut is also very good. Girls don't have to worry about it or eat makeup.

The oil sealing duck leg is the only meal that is not looking forward to today.But the fried taro diced, edamame, ham, and cabbage at the bottom are delicious!

"-馬鈴薯千層酥（台幣260元）
一上桌就可以看到這道菜有多厲害，切薄片的馬鈴薯片層層堆疊，搭配蔥奶油和起司很完美，是一道很不錯的開胃小點，也是現場觀察到每桌必點的一道菜！

-炸魚日式脆餅（台幣460元）
酥炸的午仔魚還保留魚肉特有的嫩度和油脂感，配上醃漬的楊桃一開始會很讓人困惑這個組合，但實際吃完後只會覺得沒有其他水果可以代替！ 是今日最驚艷的一道菜，吃完後嘴裡還會留有淡淡米餅的香氣

-海鮮飯（台幣640元）
類似義式燉飯的手法，中間的米心沒有完全煮透，一入口的茄汁酸味偏明顯與突兀，但是海鮮飯上方鮭魚卵帶來的海味和波波的口感增加了這道料理的層次感，時不時吃到的大蝦也增加了口感上的變化，可點但推薦4人左右一起分食最適合（保持在一種吃到且意猶未盡的感覺，如果兩人分食有點偏多，口味偏重）

-炸牛排三明治（台幣980元）
本日最期待也是本日最膩，牛排非常軟嫩，搭配烤過酥脆的牛奶麵包剛剛好，可惜仍有牛排炸過後的油膩感，個人口味是普通可嘗試，但建議四人分食（一人一塊剛好）

整體來說是一家非常不錯的餐酒館，菜色特別、有創意且好吃！
最後的帳單裝在幸運餅乾裡面很可愛！ （幸運餅乾本身也很好吃唷）","-The potato thousand layers (Taiwan dollars 260 yuan)
As soon as you serve, you can see how powerful this dish is. The thin potato chips are stacked layer by layer. It is perfect with green onion cream and cheese. It is a very good appetizer. A dish!

-Chafoma Japanese -style crispy biscuits (NT $ 460)
The fried noon fish also retains the tenderness and fatness of the fish. With the pickled cattoes, it will be confusing this combination at first, but after eating, there will only be no other fruits to replace!It is the most amazing dish today. After eating, there will be a light rice cake in the mouth.

-Haihai Rice (NT $ 640)
Similar to the method of stewed rice, the rice heart in the middle is not completely cooked, and the sour taste of the eggplant juice at the entrance is obvious and abrupt, but the taste of seafood and Bobo brought by salmon eggs above the seafood rice increases the level of this dish. Feeling, the prawns that are eaten from time to time have also increased the taste change, but you can order about 4 people to eat together (keep it in a feeling of eating and you still. Dispute)

-Onfall Steak Sandwich (NT $ 980)
The most anticipated today is the most greasy today. The steak is very soft and tender. It is just right with grilled crispy milk bread. Unfortunately, there is still the greasy feeling after steak fried. Personal taste is normal to try, but it is recommended that four people eat it (one person is just right. .

On the whole, it is a very good dining tavern. The dishes are special, creative and delicious!

"第一次在此店用餐
算是一間精緻的餐酒館
食物都有經過擺盤以及設計過
吃到滿經驗的是一道筍子的菜色
以及炸牛排三明治 其肉質的軟嫩程度就很像是成三片吐司一樣，咬下去軟到感覺不出來，入口即化的感覺令人驚艷
豬肋排有很多不同的辛香料
稍微偏重口味一點

稍嫌有點可惜的是甜點稍微沒這麼對我的味
有點稍微甜膩了些~

"這次是因為替妹妹慶生到此店消費，來之前也先做好功課，把網路上大家推薦的幾道餐點都點了一輪，不確定是不是期望抱太高，馬鈴薯千層酥沒有大家說得那麼驚艷，反倒是炸和牛三明治深得我心! 那個牛油融進烤吐司裡面，厚實的口感整個咬下非常滿足!! 但一定要趁熱吃麵包才不會軟掉。海鮮燉飯我個人覺得是可以想像的味道，有在水準之上但不到驚艷。最後必須稱讚一下服務，從接待到上餐點的人員臉上都掛滿笑容，也非常親切!!! 還是值得一吃的餐廳!

推薦份量: 我們這次是兩個女生用餐，點了馬鈴薯千層派/海鮮燉飯/炸牛排三明治/猴子麵包就非常飽","This time, because I celebrated my sister's birthday to this store, I also did my homework before I came. I ordered a few meals recommended by everyone on the Internet for a round. Everyone said so amazing, but the fried and beef sandwiches won my heart! That butter was melted into the grilled toast, and the thick texture was very satisfying! But you must eat bread while it is hot.I personally think that the seafood stewed rice can be imagined, there is a standard but not amazing.Finally, you must praise the service. From the reception to the person who goes to the meal, the face is full of smiles, and it is very kind !!! It is still worth eating restaurant!

Recommended amount: We dine two girls this time, and we ordered potato thousands of layers/seafood stew/fried steak sandwich/monkey bread.",False
"先說結論，餐點上下限高，服務好的沒話說

我們是中午的時段前往非瓶用餐，店內的氛圍很有商務用餐的感覺，服務非常周到，態度熱情介紹也十分詳細。

點完餐到出餐等了些時間，有招待玉米球是蠻貼心的，不過玉米球是精緻澱粉，吃完容易產生飽足感，影響後續食慾，這點有一點點小可惜，而且玉米球味道普通。

海鮮沙拉的部分，味道酸甜拿捏恰到好處，醬汁搭配的很完美沒什麼好挑剔的，海鮮的處理也很到位，賣相也不錯看得出用心！

主餐的部分我們聽了服務員的推薦點了炸雞比司吉與烤雞漢堡。烤雞漢堡的調味添加許多酸酸的感覺，讓漢堡吃起來比較沒有負擔，是不錯的想法，不過整體吃起來沒有很驚艷。炸雞比司吉的部分則讓人出乎意料，除了雞肉不柴以外幾乎沒有任何優點，炸雞本身十分普通，吃不出什麼特點，兩個比司吉也只是虛有飽足感的澱粉炸彈，與前面提到的海鮮沙拉有著天壤之別。

甜點的部分我們選了香蕉蘋果可麗餅，這道與海鮮沙拉雷同，不論從味道到賣相上都可圈可點，沒有什麼好挑剔的，對得起近乎主餐的價格。

最後帳單也以相當驚喜的方式呈現，很不錯

總結：吃完後感覺非瓶的定位至始至終都很明確，就是主打精緻有趣的料理，我覺得前菜跟甜點都很完美的符合這個設定，但主餐的部分相當差強人意，既不有趣也與其他餐點水準落差很大，蠻讓人失望的，建議可以拿去這項餐點。稍微看了下晚上的菜單後，我想我仍對這件餐廳抱持很高的期待與興趣，希望下次也能被好吃的主餐驚艷到！","Let's talk about the conclusion first.

We go to non -bottle dining during the noon period. The atmosphere in the store is very business meal, the service is very thoughtful, and the attitude is very detailed.

After ordering meals and meals for some time, it is quite intimate to entertain corn balls, but corn balls are exquisite starch. After eating, it is easy to have full sense of satiety and affect subsequent appetite. This is a pity, and the corn ball The taste is ordinary.

The part of the seafood salad, the taste is sweet and sweet, the sauce is perfectly matched, and it is not very picky. The processing of seafood is also in place.

In the main meal, we listened to the waiter's recommendation and ordered the fried chicken Biji and grilled chicken burgers.The seasoning of grilled chicken burgers adds a lot of sour feeling, making the burger less burden. It is a good idea, but the overall taste is not amazing.The part of the fried chicken Biji is unexpected. There is almost no advantage except the chicken. The fried chicken itself is very ordinary. The bomb is very different from the seafood salad mentioned earlier.

In the dessert, we chose banana apple cocoa. This is the same as the seafood salad. It is remarkable from the taste to the selling. There is no picky ones.

The last bill is also presented in a very surprising way, very good

Summary: After eating, the positioning of non -bottle is clear from beginning to end, that is, the main special dish. I think the former dishes and desserts are perfectly in line with this setting, but the main meal is quite unsatisfactory, which is neither interesting. It is also very different from the level of other meals, which is quite disappointing. It is recommended to take this meal.After looking at the next night's menu, I think I still have high expectations and interests about this restaurant. I hope that I can be amazed by the delicious main meal next time!",False

"烤芥蘭的味道和口感層次變化都很豐富，味蕾和大腦都會很忙，但不會過於複雜，各個角色都表現得很到位，像看了一齣精彩的微電影

海鮮飯料多實在，搭配白酒很適合！（服務人員推薦的是蘋果風味的，很清爽超級搭！）

猴子麵包是整個麵包泡在醬汁裡面，麵包體口感會變得很軟很濕潤（雖然我個人比較喜歡吃紮實有咬勁的麵包，但還是不可否認它是好吃的）。其實是為了蘭姆酒冰淇淋點這道的，冰淇淋好吃之外，覺得這道有趣的地方是可以搭配蘭姆酒冰淇淋冰火交錯的滋味！

環境乾淨舒適、服務人員專業親切，一個人來吃也很自在，謝謝非瓶讓我有一頓完美的生日晚餐！（一個人吃完這些真的超級飽）","The taste and taste of roasting must be rich in the layers of taste. The taste buds and brains will be very busy, but it will not be too complicated. Each role is well performed, like watching a wonderful micro -movie

The seafood rice is so real, it is suitable for white wine!(The service staff recommends the apple flavor, very refreshing and super!)

Monkey bread is soaked in the sauce, and the taste of the bread will become soft and humid (although I personally like to eat solid and bite bread, it is still undeniable that it is delicious).In fact, it is for Rim wine ice cream. In addition to the delicious ice cream, I think this interesting thing is to match the taste of Rim's ice cream ice and fire!

"聽聞很久的餐廳，終於前往用餐！
由於帶蛋糕需要另外收費，當日選擇店內甜點當作生日蛋糕！
首先前菜挑選馬鈴薯千層（也是當天我最喜歡的餐點）很脆的外層搭配醬料解膩，很喜歡的搭配
牛肉三明治的肉比較像燉牛腩的感覺，原本想像會是牛排，有點差異，但還是好吃的
中卷玉米那道前菜有附上數顆義大利餃，包裹起司，玉米本身香甜好吃，朋友很喜歡這道
鴨腿的醬料是酸甜口味，有提升鴨肉的香氣，搭配起來很順口
最後一個豬排（？）忘記是什麼菜，很像在中式餐廳會吃到的餐點😂挺驚訝的，但是味道也算好吃
甜點很推薦！
檸檬千層好吃，很酥脆，夠酸
另一個甜點選擇鳳梨萊姆猴子麵包 萊姆冰淇淋酒味又香又濃，是道大人的甜點，也被朋友評選為當天最愛","The restaurant that has been heard for a long time, finally go to dinner!
Since the cake is required to be charged, choose the dessert in the store as a birthday cake that day!
First of all, choose the potato thousands of layers (also my favorite meal that day) with crispy outer layer with sauce to dissolve and greasy. I like it very much
The meat of beef sandwiches is more like stewed beef. I originally thought it would be steak, which was a bit different, but it was still delicious
There are several Italian dumplings attached to the front dish of the middle roll of corn, which wraps cheese, and the corn itself is sweet and delicious. Friends like this very much.
The sauce of duck legs is sweet and sour, which has the aroma of duck meat, which is very smooth to match
The last pork chop (?) Forget what dish is, it is very surprised like the meal that you can eat in a Chinese restaurant, but the taste is delicious

"1. 環境是採開放式廚房，看到了chef Cathy（本人怎麼這麼年輕🥹）。用餐區域邊角的位子較寬敞，在走道上的位子很小，偏不舒適，但最後店家很貼心的在有客人用完餐離去後提出要幫我們換位子。

雖然上餐速度中等偏慢（也有可能是我們太餓），但服務人員的態度都非常好，也有詢問我們合不合胃口、是否有吃飽等，是非常加分的一項。

2. 餐點部分想特別提到茭白筍那道菜～可能是因為我們剛好很餓而那是我們吃的第一道菜，我覺得有被wow到，微酸的茭白筍沾上那個醬我覺得非常開胃。

至於很多人點的炸牛排三明治，有可能是我個人的喜好，但我更喜歡偏結實的牛肉，感覺會更有「嗯～這是一道很結實（？的炸牛排三明治」的感覺。但我可以理解因為要更好入口而選擇使用舒肥過後的牛肉拿去炸，肉會更軟嫩，這點純粹是喜好問題。

而燉飯的部分就是像其他人照片拍的，是想像得到的味道，不會好吃到驚訝到你，就是一個偏濕的risotto，然後偶爾有鮭魚卵在嘴巴咬破的味道。

3. 價錢部分符合食物價值，對於一間在網路上很紅的點來說不會overpriced。

總結：第一次去非瓶用餐，可能我預期太高，所以有一點不符合我的期望，但整體來講是一間不錯的餐酒館，但跟類似價位的餐酒館感覺沒很大的區隔（我認為這可能是我較失望的原因）。 我覺得可以跳脫出可預期的料理味道，雖然可能會比較冒險，但會更有新鮮感，","1. The environment is a open kitchen, and I saw Chef Cathy (why I am so young).The position of the corner of the dining area is relatively spacious. The seat on the aisle is very small and uncomfortable, but in the end, the store was intimate after the guests finished the meal and left.

Although the meal is slow (maybe we are too hungry), the attitude of the service staff is very good, and it is also a very bonus to ask us if we do not agree with appetite and whether they are full.

2. The meal section wants to mention the dish of the white bamboo shoots in particular ~ Maybe it is because we are just hungry and that is the first dish we eat. I think there is wow to get it. I feel very appetizing.

As for the fried beef steak sandwich that many people ordered, it may be my personal preference, but I prefer the strong beef, and I feel that it will be more ""um ~ this is a very strong (?? Fried beef steak sandwich"". It can be understood that it is softer and tender because it is necessary to use the beef of the fat to fry because of the better entrance. The meat will be softer and tender.

The part of the stewed rice is taken like other people's photos. It is the taste of imagination. It is not delicious to be surprised to you. It is a humid Risotto, and occasionally there is the taste of salmon eggs biting on the mouth.

3. The price partly meets the value of food. For a very popular point on the Internet, it will not be OVERPRICED.

Summary: For the first time to go to non -bottle dining, I may expect too high, so there is one thing that does not meet my expectations, but overall is a good dining tavern, but it feels like a dining tavern at similar prices.

"在台北一般我比較不願意到西餐廳，原因在於收費及烹調，但朋友極力推薦所以就來試試，也稍有期待，首先點了一缶2016 年的 Vigne Vecchie Primitivo di Manduria，十分滿意，可能是幾個月前在南義的Puglia 自駕，所以特別選了這一區的紅酒
前面幾道頭枱都很不錯，牛肉塔塔，番茄冷盤，都還很ok,但馬鈴薯千層酥則一般，最後上的紐約客牛排我是十分失望，但我的朋友覺得還不錯，服務人員並未詢問牛排的熟度就直接上了medium rare,還好我們都可以接受，但這一道菜的擺盤真的有些讓我哭笑不得，太亂太複雜了","In Taipei, I generally do n’t want to go to the Western restaurant because of charges and cooking, but my friends are highly recommended, so I try to try it. I also look forward to it. First, I ordered the Vigne Vecchie Primitivo di Manduria in 2016. It was Puglia self -driving in Nanyi a few months ago, so I chose red wine in this area.

"本人不愛喝飲料跟喝酒，必須說個人的評論對這間餐廳不是很公平，如果你不是來喝酒的，那建議晚餐鹹食除了主餐以外的餐點不要超過三道。

這次失策兩人除了主餐點了六道，吃完除了膩以外沒有別的記憶，也沒辦法再點甜點。

如果跟我一樣不喝酒的，會建議點必點的 馬鈴薯千層酥（是炸的非常重油，熱熱的吃味道很好，起司點綴很香）、青甘魚（唯一較清爽的，一訪時候吃有驚艷到👍）、一個海鮮飯（濃郁型），怕吃不飽再點主餐。但最好還是點一個去膩的飲品。

不推薦日本茄子，醬料吃起來很像夜市牛排的黑胡椒醬，吃一口好想來碗飯或一個麵包，然後就不想再吃第二口。

生牛塔塔一般般，不驚艷，沒吃出什麼層次，整口都是麻油味道沒其他的，也不搭美乃滋

也不推薦花枝（如果點了馬鈴薯千層），因為花枝也是滿滿奶油跟起司…. 玉米很香 就是少了個kick，也沒吃出什麼花枝的香味

整體服務氣氛都很好，就是小心大多的菜都偏膩口。不然小酌聊天，配菜（1-3道）很剛好👌🏻","I do n’t like drinking drinks and drinking. I have to say that personal comments are not fair to this restaurant. If you are not here to drink, it is recommended that you do n’t have more than three meals except for the main meal.

This time, the two had six people who ordered the main meal. After eating, there was no other memories, and there was no way to order desserts again.

If you do n’t drink like me, you will be recommended to order the potato for thousands of layers of crispy (it is very heavy oil, the hot taste is very good, the cheese is very fragrant), the green fish fish (the only one is more refreshing, a one, one I was amazing when I visited), a seafood rice (rich type), I was afraid that I would not eat and order the main meal.But it is best to order a non -greasy drink.

It is not recommended for Japanese eggplant. The sauce tastes very much like the black pepper sauce of steak in the night market. If you want to eat a bowl of rice or a bread, you don't want to eat the second bite.

The raw beef pagoda is general, it is not amazing, I do n’t eat any level, the whole mouth is all the taste of sesame oil.

It is not recommended that Hua Zhi (if you ordered a thousand layers of potatoes), because the flower branches are also full of cream and cheese ... The corn is very fragrant, but it is less KICK.

The overall service atmosphere is very good, that is, be careful of most dishes.Otherwise, chat, side dishes (1-3) are just 👌🏻",False

The amount of each dish of the lunch menu is relatively large, and the three of us have a meal and 5 dishes are full.
The salty food is recommended for charcoal -grilled seafood salad ($ 420) and the fried chicken Biji ($ 420). It is crispy and crispy than Siji, and it tastes a bit like Sikang, but it does not lose some Sikang stores at all.
No matter how full of desserts, you must have a comprehensive berry French toast ($ 420). The sour and iced berries are equipped with hot French toast. There are many types of berries. point!

馬鈴薯千層酥 $280
十分的驚豔，超級好吃，全部最滿意的一道，很好奇他的工法是如何處理的，青醬的搭配更是絕配，與酥脆的千層馬鈴薯一同入口，真是美味，上面的香菜一開始還沒有發現，長得跟一般的香菜真不像
海鮮飯 $640
送來的時候發現有點小碗，看網路上別人拍還以為很大一碗，但這道也是蠻滿意的，整碗的蝦熬出來的醬十分濃郁，搭配著有鮭魚卵做點綴的燉飯，太爽了⋯還有檸檬的清香陪襯，讓吃完一整碗也不會覺得油膩
豬肋排 $640
上面有淋上辣麻油，超香，服務員說這道是新的料理，覺得這道菜的肉軟骨有點太多了，實際吃到的肉量蠻少的，應該是可以換別的比較少軟骨的部位會更好，調味上也是無可挑剔的美味
起司烏龍茶蛋糕 $360
甜點就略顯遜色，覺得普普，烏龍茶淋醬搭配冰淇淋還不錯，蛋糕體跟乳酪慕斯的搭配覺得還好，慕斯的調味太酸太搶戲了
飲品還有點了鮮奶茶與啤酒花蘋果酒，都很好喝，總體而言美味程度值得5顆星，CP值來看稍嫌太貴，外場服務生很多，看起來都沒事做，會站在一旁聊天，但服務態度很好","The deliciousness of the meal is impeccable.

Pork ribs $ 640
There are spicy sesame oil and super fragrant on it. The waiter said that this is a new dish. I think there are too many cartilage of this dish. The actual amount of meat is quite small. The location will be better, and the seasoning is also impeccable delicious
Cheese oolong tea cake $ 360
The dessert is slightly inferior, I think Pop, oolong tea sauce with ice cream is not bad, the cake body and cheese mousse feels good, the mousse seasoning

份量走精緻不多但剛好。當日點5道。上菜時會介紹菜色的搭配方式。

個人首推：
1️⃣炸牛排三明治必點👍  ，很簡單的一道料理 ,卻很出色。牛奶麵包:包著一層厚切烤至五分熟的牛排，牛肉有著酥脆的外皮和千島醬做結合，口感多汁又酥脆的，讓人一口一口再嘴中環繞，💕而且不會死鹹，切的剛剛好。
2️⃣ 鳳梨蘭 姆酒猴子麵包 甜點：這道需要等半小時
黑糖醬的蓬鬆麵包沾一點蘭姆酒冰淇淋，入口極化，不過蘭姆酒有點重，開車🚗不能吃呀😂。
3️⃣海鮮飯 ：可能是干貝和蝦子的結合真的粒粒的飯中有鮮甜的海鮮滋味，上面放了鮭魚卵，更加提升嘴巴的口感。
馬鈴薯千層酥：這道也很特別，一層層馬鈴薯烤的酥脆堆疊而成一串，青醬和一點鴨油的香氣，更加突顯風味。

香料皎白筍：僅能說蔬菜比較特別是沾蛋黃醬。
餐廳🍴：可用現金和信用卡和apple pay 。

價格：高價位😂對個人來說。

Personal first push:
1️⃣ Fried steak sandwiches must be ordered, a very simple dish, but it is excellent.Milk bread: wraps a layer of thick cutting until five -point steak. The beef has crispy skin and Thousand Island sauce as a combination. The cut is just right.
2️⃣ Pineapple Lanjum Monkey Bread: This way needs to wait for half an hour
The fluffy bread of brown sugar sauce is stained with a little Rim ice cream, and the entrance is polarized, but Rim is a bit heavy.
3️⃣ Seafood rice: It may be that the combination of scallops and shrimp is really a sweet seafood flavor in the rice. The salmon eggs are placed on it to enhance the taste of the mouth.
Potato thousands of crispy: This is also very special. The crispy stack of potato roasted layers of potato is stacked into a string. The aroma of green sauce and a little duck oil is even more highlighted.

Plusal white bamboo shoots: It can be said that vegetables are more than egg yolk sauce.
Restaurant 可: Available cash and credit cards and Apple Pay.

"用餐日期2/18，三人共4800-5000左右

服務生服務非常好，眼力跟服務的速度都很剛好且不會給人壓力且親切，訓練得當。另外一點我比較在意的是餐廳的桌子，有點不穩，在切牛排的時候能感覺到晃動，除此之外沒有其他狀況，蠻適合來約會用餐的，餐點品味可以給好的印象，氛圍舒服，服務也很加分。

開胃菜
蝦醬奶油麵包
因為本人當時以經很餓，有點忘記他細節的狀況，不過是好吃的，蝦醬本身長得有點像太妃糖，起初有點甜味，蝦味在後面才出來，所以請細嚼慢嚥，不要一次太快忘記品嚐。

馬鈴薯千層酥
前陣子在社群上才看到這道料理很想吃，居然在這邊能點到所以一定要來試試。馬鈴薯千層外皮酥脆，裡面的馬鈴薯鬆軟，沾上奶油和青醬味道都很不錯，但老實說我個人吃完覺得還行，驚艷程度比起其他料理稍微遜色一些些。

香料茭白筍
這道料理蠻常見的，值得一提是難得見到茭白筍這麼有肉也切得夠厚的，醬料調理的得當，吃起來非常開胃。

前菜
義式番茄冷盤
這道冷盤是目前前菜中我覺得很過癮的一道，一盤裡面涵蓋了兩三種番茄，有的醃漬過有的單純就是沾著羅勒醬的味道，清爽中帶著濃郁，搭配炸過的酸種麵包 ㄎㄠㄎㄠ，像是吃披薩一樣大膽大口的咬下去咀嚼很爽。

炙燒青甘魚
平常很常吃日式類型的餐點，看到炙燒青甘魚的時候並沒有特別吸引我。不過在餐點上來後看到旁邊的點綴物以及調料擺盤，還好差點沒有粗魯的一口咽下，青甘魚沒有腥味，除此之外還有沾醬的一股酸，搭配起魚肉有種意想不到的濃郁鮮味，後面再來一口新鮮葡萄柚果肉，清爽，意猶未盡。

主菜
炸牛排三明治
相對於我們點的牛排，我覺得這道更深得我心。市面上有許多這樣炸牛排的料理，非瓶在處理牛肉這塊有感覺到用心，外皮不是由麵包粉包裹，而是他們自製的麵衣。肉質鮮嫩就像燉過的口感，看得到油脂在裡面的狀態，咬下去肉汁充滿鼻腔，嫩得不得了，搭配麵包的感觸感極高，得說這道吃完對有些人來說可能會偏膩，但吃過這樣的處理方式我覺得會回不去。

肋眼
五分熟，切開是漂亮粉紅色，中規中矩，搭配羽衣甘藍還有特調的醬汁，咀嚼起來肉汁鮮甜，就是標準牛排。","The dining date is 2/18, and the three people have a total of about 4800-5000

The waiter's service is very good, the speed of eye power and service are just right and will not be stressful and kind, and the training is proper.Another thing I care about is the restaurant's table, which is a bit unstable. I can feel shaking when cutting the steak. There is no other situation. It is quite suitable for dating to dine. Comfortable, the service is also very bonus.

Appetizer
Shrimp sauce cream bread
Because I was hungry at that time, I forgot to the details of his details, but it was delicious. The shrimp sauce itself was a bit like a concubine sugar. At first, the shrimp flavor came out. Don't forget to taste too quickly.

Potato thousands of layers
I only saw this dish I wanted to eat in the community a while ago. I can try it here so I can try it.The potato is crispy in the outer skin. The potatoes inside are soft, and the cream and green sauce are very good, but honestly, I feel that it is okay after eating. The stunning level is slightly inferior to that of other dishes.

Spice white bamboo shoots
This dish is quite common. It is worth mentioning that it is rare to see white bamboo shoots so meaty enough. The sauce is properly conditioned, and it tastes very appetizing.

Front dish
Bonus -style tomato cold plate
This cold plate is a one that I feel very enjoyable in the previous dish. One plate covers two or three types of tomatoes. Some pickled some of them are simply stained with the taste of Lales sauce. The bread of bread is boldly biting like eating pizza.

Roasted green fish
I usually eat Japanese -style meals, and I did not particularly attract me when I saw burning green fish.However, after the meal comes up, I see the embellishment and seasoning of the side. Fortunately, there is no rude swaying. The green fish does not have a fishy smell. In addition, there is a sour. There is an unexpected rich umami, and there is another fresh grapefruit flesh in the back.

main course
Fried beef steak sandwich
Compared to the steak we ordered, I think this is more deeply my heart.There are many such fried steak dishes on the market. Non -bottle feels attentive in treating beef. The skin is not wrapped in bread flour, but their homemade noodles.The tender meat is like stewed taste. It can see the state of the oil inside. The gravy is full of nasal cavity, which is too tender. It is very high to match with bread. I was tired, but I felt that I couldn't go back after eating such a treatment.

料理手法相當不錯，不要在意吃相整個放到嘴裡，外酥內軟，整個在嘴裡的口感，我超愛😍

牛排三明治
牛排真的是軟嫩 軟嫩 軟嫩
牛排外層還有一層炸薄皮， 額外增加一層口感
但是如果只單吃有點偏鹹吃到第二個就我覺得有點小膩，如果有搭配紅酒 一定會大加分！

店內環境跟廚房都是開放式的
抽風做的很好不會有太多料理過程的烹飪味道參雜在環境中，很多開放式的廚房最怕就是身上會有食物餐廳的味道

但店內有點小 所以感覺會少了一點氣氛的感覺

"第四次來，週六中午用餐，兩個人點了牡蠣炒蛋、牛小排、莎莎鮭魚，以及兩杯無酒精飲料，共約 2640 元。

"最好吃的是筊白筍！炭烤的香氣很棒
不過跟黃檸檬不太搭 單吃就很好吃了
美乃滋味道普通有點油

The potato thousands of potatoes are recommended to eat while it is hot
Otherwise, the more you put more oil and you can't finish eating
Although it is a thousand layers, it actually tastes fried potatoes
No surprise
I can't understand this in the middle of the roll
The noodles of Italian dumplings are so thick -filled, the flavor is not obvious
The overall seems to be eating a large dough
The rarely rolled volume is that the corn kernels occasionally bite the fragmented hazelnut taste and the taste of the sauce and the sauce is sour?

"今天是第二次來吃，和上次的菜單幾乎都不一樣了，但是經典的氮氣馬鈴薯還是在。
除了餐點好吃，尤其服務非常好，態度親切，服務迅速而且不會有壓迫感，用餐環境很舒適！

今晚點的餐
1.氮氣馬鈴薯：
口感綿密、風味濃郁，這兩次都有點，非常推薦。
2.馬鈴薯千層酥：
和起司跟醬料搭配，拉到完美的平衡。
3.炙燒青甘魚：
魚肉鮮嫩，搭配佐料和葡萄柚，口感很味道都很清爽。
4.青醬蘆筍：
清爽，餐前適合開胃，餐中可以解膩。
5.中卷：
新鮮的海鮮搭配義大利餃，奶油味十足極推。
6.海鮮飯：
料多且風味濃郁，且非常有飽足感。
7.Negroni：
常點的調酒，但店內的Negroni是用氣泡水調製，增添口感，酒體感覺上也變薄，相對清爽，適合大眾點選（需滿18）。

甜點
1.猴子麵包：
麵包烘培得綿密好入口，底層還有濃厚的香蕉泥，搭配玉米濃湯風味的冰淇淋和自製焦糖爆米花，應該算是店內招牌之一。
2.咖啡焦糖千層酥：👍
咖啡融入馬士卡彭起司，覆蓋在焦糖千層酥上，頂層搭配利口酒果凍，氣味香甜，擺盤精美，口感酥脆，色香味都屬上層，今日最推，極度推薦！

Order tonight
1. Nitrogen potato:
The taste is dense and rich in flavor. These twice are a bit, it is very recommended.
2. Potasse thousand -layer crisp:
Match with the cheese and sauce to pull the perfect balance.
3. Roasted green fish:
The fish is tender, with condiments and grapefruit, the taste is very refreshing.
4. Green sauce asparagus:
Refreshing, suitable for appetizers before meals, can be relieved in meals.
5. Mid -volume:
Fresh seafood with Italian dumplings, creamy flavor is full.
6. Seafood rice:
There are many materials and rich flavor and very full.
7.negroni:
Frequent bartending, but the Negroni in the store uses air bubbles to adjust, adding taste, the body feels thinner, relatively refreshing, suitable for the public to choose (need to be over 18).

dessert
1. Monkey bread:
The bread is baked and the entrance is dense. The bottom layer also has a strong banana mud. Ice cream with the flavor of corn soup and homemade caramel popcorn should be regarded as one of the signboards in the store.
2. Coffee caramel thousand layers of crisp: 👍
The coffee is blends into the Maska Peng cheese, covered with caramel thousand layers of crispy, and the top layer is matched with liquor jelly. The smell is sweet, the dish is exquisite, the taste is crispy, and the color and fragrance belong to the upper layer.

"坐在裡面吧台的位置，剛好可以觀賞開放式廚房運作的情形，整體而言分工非常清楚、大家各司其職，都認真在崗位上做好自己負責的餐點。
三個人沒有點酒水，吃了快3000元...總結來說份量精緻、價位偏高。食物基本上是走創意料理的路線，但有些搭配個人吃不太懂就是了...
#馬鈴薯千層酥：就是疊在一起的炸薯片，外面酥脆中間濕軟，搭配酸奶和醃漬的紫洋蔥，是店內點餐率非常高的一道
#海鮮飯：份量比想像的小，但用料豐富，海鮮種類多，飯粒則保留米心，算是相對安全常見的口味
#氮氣馬鈴薯：馬鈴薯泥綿密中帶有濃厚的奶香，上頭灑上咖啡粉，吃到咖啡粉時有種在吃提拉米蘇的感覺，反而有點出戲，個人覺得單純馬鈴薯泥應該非常優秀XD
#豬五花：表皮烤的酥脆，肉也不會太肥，配上自家醃製的泡菜，還有口感特殊的豆腐泥在兩種強烈的味道中協調、平衡
#炸牛排三明治：因為看到不少評論說千島醬很失敗，特別請店家幫我們分開放。不沾醬的吐司和炸牛排真的是沒味道，但搭上千島醬又覺得沒有起到加分的作用，最後結論是單吃炸牛排，或單吃吐司沾千島醬都好吃...
#伯爵茶猴子麵包：布里歐麵包站上伯爵茶醬進去烤，吃起來像布丁麵包的口感，伯爵茶香夠，搭配的檸檬雪酪也好吃，但一樣，吃不太懂兩者加在一起的美味QQ
#幸運餅乾：一桌一份，個頭很大，甜度偏高，裡面有兩張小紙條，算是店家的小巧思吧","Sitting in the bar is just to watch the operation of the open kitchen operation. On the whole, the division of labor is very clear. Everyone has their own duties.

#: It is the fried potato chips stacked together. The crispy outside is soft and soft in the middle, with yogurt and pickled purple onions.
#: The portion is smaller than expected, but the ingredients are rich, and there are many types of seafood.
#Nitrogen potato: The potato puree is dense with a strong aroma, and the coffee powder is sprinkled on it. When eating coffee powder, there is a feeling of eating Tiramisu. XD
#: The crispy of the skin is grilled, the meat is not too fat, with its own pickled kimchi, and the special tofu puree coordinate and balance in two strong flavors
#Steak sandwich: Because I saw a lot of comments saying that Qiandao Sauce failed, I asked the store to help us open.Toast and fried steaks that do not dip the sauce are really tasteless, but the thousands of island sauce feels that it does not play a role in adding points.

"很久以前看到牛排三明治就想來嚐鮮了！

今天點了四道菜：千層馬鈴薯、海鮮飯、豬五花、牛排三明治。

馬鈴薯的口感非常好，跟起司醬跟醃菜的搭配不錯，酸酸微鹹，吃起來滿開胃的，把馬鈴薯片一片一片疊上去，實在是太牛了，給備料的一個讚👍🏻

海鮮飯雖然份量少，但整體味道非常夠，充滿蝦子的味道，稱他為蝦飯也不錯。

豬五花卡滋卡滋的，雖然沒吃過館長的燒肉飯，但我認為這邊的豬五花吃起來跟館長的一樣頂，不信你去問店家。搭配他們旁邊配的韓式泡菜，可以緩解五花肉的油膩感。

牛排三明治，最後壓軸登場的，但我現在不吃牛，女朋友覺得很好吃，她以前國文課不專心，導致詞彙很少，只能講出很好吃三個字。

整體下來還不錯，服務也還可以。

畢竟我也不太喜歡服務員太熱心服務，有感到被服務就心滿意足了。","A long time ago, I wanted to have a trout when I saw steak sandwiches!

Today I ordered four dishes: thousands of layers of potatoes, seafood rice, pork pork flowers, steak sandwiches.

The taste of potatoes is very good. The matching with cheese sauce and pickles is good, sour and salty, and appetizing. It is too good to stack the potato chips one by one.

Although the seafood rice is small, the overall taste is very enough. The taste of shrimp is full of shrimp rice.

Pig Wulin Kakaki, although I haven't eaten the curator's roast rice, but I think the pig Wuhua here has the same as the curator. I don't believe you ask the shop.With the Korean -style kimchi next to them, the greasy feeling of pork belly can be relieved.

Steak sandwiches, finally the finale appeared, but I do n’t eat cows now, and my girlfriend feels delicious. She used to do n’t concentrate on the Chinese class. As a result, the vocabulary was very small, and I could only speak three delicious words.

豬胸肉-肉處理得讓人吃不出是豬胸肉

海鮮飯-食材本身夠好吃，但吃太多會膩，建議多人分食再點

不推：
馬鈴薯千層酥-就是一般的烤馬鈴薯，很普通

"價位高，不過食物是真的好吃
但是！服務品質真的有夠差，尤其是戴眼鏡的男服務生，我們上座只問我們要礦泉水還是氣泡水，要不要加檸檬？
送來水以後詢問他氣泡水要錢嗎？才知道原來一罐$150，我就說那不需要了一般水就好，然後他態度沒很好的收走了

水要錢不是應該先講嗎？這是最基本的吧？是打算不告知等到結帳才發現自己喝了$150的水嗎？
事後我告知那位男服務生你態度不良好，他也是只說了「喔 不好意思」臉上的態度實在非常不情願
這是我的主觀感受，不適用其他人，畢竟我也看到那位服務生非常「用心」及「熱情」的招待其他客人，也許其他客人消費金額比較高並且有點氣泡水^_^

實在不是要計較那瓶水，這真的是感受問題，收費不便宜，餐點很有水準，但服務態度是最基本的，況且收了服務費還這樣？
事後查看過往的評價，發現不告知水要加錢及服務態度的問題已經存在很久了！

所以請問店家是有要改善嗎？是有打算要檢討嗎？這家店的五星評價不知道是洗出來的還是店家會看人服務^_^

個人覺得跟朋友花了$2300吃這頓飯有夠不值得==","The price is high, but the food is really delicious
but!The quality of service is really bad, especially the male waiter wearing glasses. We only asked us to want mineral water or bubble water. Do you want to add lemon?
After sending water, ask him if he asked for money for bubble water?I only knew that a can of $ 150, I said that it doesn’t need to be normal water, and then he doesn’t take it well.

Shouldn't water ask for money first?Is this the most basic?Do you plan not to tell you until the checkout and find that you drink $ 150 water?
Afterwards, I told the male waiter that you have a bad attitude, and he only said that the attitude on his face was really reluctant
This is my subjective feeling, and I am not applicable to others. After all, I also saw the waiter's very ""intentional"" and ""enthusiastic"" entertaining other guests. Perhaps other guests have a high amount of consumption and a bit bubble.

It is really not to care about that bottle of water. This is really a problem. The charges are not cheap. The meal is very standard, but the service attitude is the most basic. Moreover, this is the service fee?
Checking the past evaluation afterwards, I found that the problem of not being informed of water and service attitude has been for a long time!

So does the store want to improve?Is there a plan to review?I don’t know if the five -star evaluation of this shop is washed or the store will see people service^_^

Personally, I think it ’s not worth eating at $ 2300 to eat this meal. ==",False

🔹 馬鈴薯千層酥:第一次看到馬鈴薯弄成千層的樣子感覺非常費工，仔細掰開真的是一層一層疊上來
蔥奶油超級香，比品客洋芋片的洋蔥味還香，整道配上蔥奶油才好吃

🔹 氮氣馬鈴薯:MVP！！！！馬鈴薯泥搭配奶油的關係吃起來得像布丁液化般地口感要仔細品嘗才會感覺得出馬鈴薯泥的味道與奶油香氣，個人覺得像布丁液化後的樣態外表看起來很像蒸蛋

🔹 雲林究好豬五花:皮非常的酥脆，中間肥肉油滋滋入口即化，下方瘦肉很軟嫩一咬即斷咬起來有點彈性，店員建議搭配旁邊的泡菜與豆腐泥吃下去，但店員說可以配氮氣馬鈴薯比較合我胃口

🔹 炸牛排三明治:推薦必點！！牛小排超級香的還沒上桌就先聞到香氣，肉質嫩又多汁，然後吐司麵包塗有千島醬帶來有層次的食物印象

🔹 海鮮飯:推薦！！！用大蝦熬的湯做出來的燉飯味道很濃郁的，我最近吃很多海鮮燉飯都是用蝦熬成的，雖然不是我心中的最好吃的但灑有鮭魚卵非常好吃，干貝切成小碎塊，蝦子吃得到整隻，

"第一次造訪，行前有先查閱過網路資訊，防疫期間都有落實防疫需求，這一點很棒，入座後會先詢問您喝的水要哪一種，這些也沒有問題，也建議等到同行友人抵達後再進行菜單介紹。
第一位服務同仁抵達時，介紹如果前兩樣(200/360)比較像前菜，(520/760)比較像主菜，因此可以點個4-6份適合兩位吃，但沒有針對菜色進行介紹，點餐時也沒有針對點的內容是否合適介紹，也許走比較隨性的路線。
上餐時陸續發現我們點的餐點較為濃郁，無論是莎拉還是經典的馬鈴薯千層酥，都屬於較為重口味的調味，所以一開頭吃得很辛苦，之後上的中捲，口味上應該是比較清爽，但也因前兩道的重口味而使中捲感到清淡，最後的豬五花真的好吃，但整條不好切的泡菜幾乎讓整盤看起來像場災難，最後上的海鮮飯是真的很好吃，不過他上的順序是最後一道，對我來說負擔已經太大。

最最後，我期待服務人員可以詢問，今天的餐點都還習慣嗎？是否有需要調整或是建議的地方？但由於店內即便服務滿分，但缺少這一個詢問讓服務品質下降不少。","For the first visit, I first checked online information before the trip, and there was a need for implementation of epidemic prevention during the epidemic prevention.

When the first service colleagues arrived, the introduction. If the first two (200/360) are more like a pre-dish, (520/760) are more like the main dish, so you can order 4-6 copies for two, but you are not introduced to the dishes. There is no content to introduce the content of the point when ordering, maybe take a more casual route.
When I went to the meal, I found that the meals we ordered were relatively strong. Whether it was Sarah or the classic potato thousands of crispy crispy, it was a more flavorful seasoning, so it was very hard to eat at the beginning. It is relatively refreshing, but because of the heavy taste of the previous two, the middle roll feels light. The last pig Wuhua is really delicious, but the entire bad kimchi almost makes the whole market look like a disaster. The seafood rice is really delicious, but his order is the last one, which is too burden on me.

蠻喜歡這間店對於食材的重視，肉品來源清楚；也喜歡他將食材搭配的很有意思，感覺的出在思考材料時的腦力激盪。

午餐和晚餐的菜單不同，真心希望中餐的份量可以多一點，畢竟菜單做了落差，應該有預期到午餐並不太喝酒而是來餐聚，但盤子真的好空曠呀～很難訂等很久沒關係，讓人家吃飽麻～","American vegetable Italian noodles use wide noodles with fresh vegetables. The taste is OK but the amount of vegetables is not large.

The potato cuisine in the dice beef steak is good. It is quite smooth. The beef is not good or bad.

Hamburg personally thinks that it is a satisfactory burger.

The ink -style five -flowering corn tablets probably have the best one this time. The taste is just all of them. It is crispy and tender. The smooth and tender of the semi -cooked eggs make a good decoration for the taste of the whole dish.

The red -hearted guava French cake tastes very special but not violated. Lemon cream cheese will not be greasy, or maybe the portion is too small to get too long for a long time, about four to five.

I like this store's importance to ingredients, and the source of the meat is clear; I also like to match the ingredients with very interesting, and feel that the brain power of thinking when thinking about the material is excited.

我在這家餐廳的經歷非常令人失望，根據高評價和我的朋友一起用餐，但是食物非常咸，當向服務員提出時，服務和反應是災難性的“我們的食物就是這樣為了適合你的飲料”，我們喝了白葡萄酒。我不會推薦這個地方，因為他們有很多更好的餐廳，提供更好的食物和服務。,"My experience in this restaurant is very disappointing.

-------------------------------------------------- --
幾個月來我一直試著預訂週五晚上或週末的房間，但總是被訂滿。我終於決定在周四晚上去吃晚飯，看看到底有什麼大驚小怪的，我不得不說，我現在明白為什麼他們總是完全保留了。我們點的所有東西不僅非常美味（我正在舔盤子裡的醬汁），而且非常有創意和獨特。馬鈴薯舖絕對是一大亮點。空間很好，服務也很好。原來為我們服務的人描述了菜餚並且做得很好。第二個人只是把東西放在桌上，沒有任何解釋。雖然這對我們訂購的大多數東西來說都不是太大問題，但令人非常沮喪的是她沒有告訴我們我們訂購的日本茄子菜。它上面放著薯片，下面有一種我們甚至看不到的醬汁，我們無法真正弄清楚理想的吃法是什麼。","Since the first visit, I have been back many times, and the service has been in place!Food is still amazing, innovative and delicious.After trying a breakfast and dinner menu, I think the dinner menu must be more interesting and unique.Red curry octopus is so delicious!I think botttless is definitely one of my favorite restaurants.

In the past few months, I have been trying to book a room on Friday night or weekend, but I have always been full.I finally decided to go to dinner on Thursday evening to see what a scaryness was, and I have to say that I now understand why they always keep it.Everything we ordered is not only very delicious (I am licking the sauce in the plate), but also very creative and unique.The potato shop is definitely a highlight.The space is very good and the service is good.The people who served us described the dishes and made well.The second person just puts things on the table without any explanation.Although this is not a big problem for most of the things we ordered, it is very frustrating that she did not tell us that we ordered the Japanese eggplant.There are potato chips on it, and there is a sauce we can't even see. We can't really figure out what the ideal is.",False
早午餐整體來說味道比較濃。義大利麵的番茄醬很濃，排骨的味道有點鹹，但它們很嫩😉如果你喜歡寬敞的用餐體驗，休息區有點小，這不是一個可以去的地方，加上開放式廚房會讓你有點不舒適。幸運🥠餅乾是比爾的創意，而且很有趣，很好吃。,"Somalonous lunch meals as a whole.The Italian tomato sauce is very strong, and the taste of the ribs is a bit salty, but they are very tender.

這個地方太棒了。  我們和全家人一起去了那裡，吃了一頓很棒的早午餐。  他們的炸雞配餅乾是最好的。  我的 2 個兒子（10 歲和 11 歲）吃了 3 個，而且還吃不夠……真正令人瞠目結舌的是我們最後吃的肉桂麵包。  這真是我們這頓飯的完美結束:)。  我的一些照片拍得有點晚，因為在我拍照之前，兩個飢餓的男孩就狼吞虎嚥地吃完了食物……是的……那太好了！ :),"This place is great.We went there with the whole family and had a great breakfast.Their fried chicken with biscuits is the best.My two sons (10 years old and 11 years old) ate 3, and I didn't eat enough ...

休閒精緻的餐飲，非常適合團體聚餐。  所有的菜色無論是擺盤還是味道都超級有創意。  此外，工作人員非常細心，對桶裝葡萄酒的選擇也很了解。,"Leisure and exquisite catering is very suitable for group dinner.All dishes are super creative whether it is set or taste.In addition, the staff is very careful and knows the choice of barrel wine.",False
"我們是衝著它有趣的「桶裝葡萄酒」概念而來的，在周末晚上嘗試了菜單上近 60% 的菜餚。

食物整體不錯，概念上清爽，尤其是西葫蘆麵包和味噌捲心菜等開胃菜。

我們發現上鏡的牛排三明治非常令人失望，因為它太油膩了，太重了，無法享用。開胃菜咖哩花椰菜也有同樣的問題。

同時甜點也比較出色，絕對推薦南瓜冰淇淋三明治和香蕉猴麵包。

我們很喜歡那裡的服務，但服務速度還需要一些改進。我們感覺從第一道菜開始就很匆忙，一切都上得很快，我們感到有壓力去完成一道菜，然後在下一道菜上，它以某種方式扼殺了整個體驗的樂趣。","We came for its interesting ""barrel wine"" concept, and tried nearly 60% of the dishes on the menu on weekends.

The food is good as a whole, and the concept is refreshing, especially the zucchini bread and miso rolls.

We found that the steak sandwich is very disappointing because it is too greasy and too heavy to enjoy.The appetizers have the same problem.

At the same time, desserts are also excellent. It is absolutely recommended that pumpkin ice cream sandwich and banana monkey bread.

"酒很好，人們友善又幽默，食物也很棒！總而言之，這是一個我會再回來的地方！

當天最好的兩道菜是調味牛肉和法式水果吐司。吐司又鬆又濕，讓我有種在吃舒芙蕾的錯覺！

I will come here to taste their signature dishes in the next dinner -fire roasted beef sandwiches!",False
這家餐廳在一天中的不同時間提供不同的菜單項目。我們去吃早午餐，我們想吃他們的雞肉三明治，但當時沒有。不過他們的其他菜色也很不錯。雞肉和餅乾製成的餅乾本身就是一種享受。他們的可麗餅也很好吃。他們甚至在早上也提供某種無酒精雞尾酒，並且還提供一些酒精飲料。他們在用餐結束時會給你一塊幸運餅乾，餅乾本身的味道也很好。他們的菜單上有英文，並且接受本地和外國信用卡。,"This restaurant provides different menus items at different times of the day.We went to have brunch, and we wanted to eat their chicken sandwiches, but we didn't.But their other dishes are also very good.Biscuits made of chicken and biscuits are a kind of enjoyment.They are also delicious.They even provided some wine -free cocktails in the morning, and also provided some alcoholic beverages.They will give you a lucky biscuit at the end of the meal, and the taste of the biscuits itself is also very good.They have English on their menus and accept local and foreign credit cards.",False
@bottlesstw 讓我的肚子空著，裝瓶子。食物棒極了。我們點了 5 道主菜，都沒有讓人失望。最喜歡的是馬鈴薯層和西葫蘆麵包。脆皮鄉村雞作為主菜也很美味。烤牛肉三明治也很好吃。我們最重要的是一些香蕉蛋糕和巧克力甜點。,"@bottlesstw made my belly empty and bottle.The food is great.We ordered 5 main dishes, none of them were disappointing.Favorite is the potato layer and zucchini bread.Crispy rural chickens are also delicious as the main dish.Roasted beef sandwiches are also delicious.The most important thing for us is some banana cakes and chocolate desserts.",False

"很棒的服務。喜歡我們點的所有菜餚，特別是海鮮飯。我們非常喜歡它，所以我們訂購了兩次。我們還吃了冷湯蝦、馬鈴薯配奇米秋裡醬和羊奶酪、韃靼牛肉、羊肚菌泡芙和牛肉三明治。飲料方面，我們喝了義大利細麵內格羅尼、含羞草和起泡烏龍茶。

The bill is packed in lucky biscuits.Too creative!",False
有趣的地方。食物製作精良，相當精緻，質地和口味層次分明。對於玉米雜燴，他們拿出一個碗，裡面只盛有濃湯，然後將奶油部分倒入餐桌上的碗中。另一個新穎的方法是：將支票放在新鮮製作的幸運餅乾內，這樣你就必須打破餅乾才能支付食物費用。,"Interesting places.The food is well -made, quite exquisite, and the texture and taste are clear.For corn hodgepodge, they took out a bowl with only thick soup inside, and then poured the cream part into the bowl on the table.Another novel method is to put the check in the freshly made lucky biscuits so that you must break the biscuits to pay for food costs.",False
"午餐和晚餐的菜單完全不同。

幾個月來一直想嘗試這個地方。這家餐廳最糟糕的部分是你需要帶上自己的耳塞。我不敢相信一家在網路上看起來很友善和親密的餐廳事實證明是完全令人失望的。空間很擁擠，桌子緊挨著，使得你無法與坐在你面前的人交談。業主在設計這個地方時很便宜，牆壁或天花板上沒有任何吸音材料。老實說，在這裡吃飯後我覺得我的耳朵需要休息一下。食物還不錯。其實很好吃。但不會再讓我的耳朵聽到這句話。,"I have been trying to try this place for a few months.The worst part of this restaurant is that you need to bring your earplugs.I dare not believe that a restaurant that looks friendly and intimate on the Internet proves that it is completely disappointing.The space is very crowded, and the table is next to it, making you unable to talk to the person sitting in front of you.The owner is very cheap when designing this place, and there is no sound absorption material on the wall or ceiling.Honestly, after eating here, I think my ears need to rest.The food is not bad.Actually delicious.But I won't let my ears hear this.",False

"無瓶不會讓人失望。他們的食物、服務和設計都是高品質的。 Gen 和 Bottless 優雅、時尚、有趣且美味。

我想給4分。女服務員非常友善。食物的擺盤還不錯。然而，餐廳裡的噪音太可怕了，破壞了用餐的樂趣。我幾乎不聽女服務生解釋每道菜以及朋友和我說話。而且我還必須說得又重又大聲。我沒想到會這樣，特別是我只是想和我的朋友隨意聊天，輕鬆吃頓飯。在這種用餐環境下，我可能不會因為食物而回店。有點失望..,"I want to give 4 points.Women's waiters are very friendly.The dish of food is not bad.However, the noise in the restaurant is too terrible, destroying the fun of dining.I hardly listen to the female waiter to explain every dish and talk to me.And I must say heavy and loud.I didn't expect this to be like this, especially I just wanted to chat with my friends and eat easily.In this dining environment, I may not return to the store because of food.A little disappointed ..",False

最後在幾個朋友的推薦下決定去這家餐廳，這裡的食物和服務讓我感到驚喜。對我來說最精彩的是雞肉漢堡，炸雞和餅乾也很好吃。如果您想吃一些正宗的西式早午餐，我會推薦您。,"Finally, I decided to go to this restaurant with the recommendation of a few friends. The food and services here surprised me.The most exciting for me is the chicken burger, and fried chicken and biscuits are also delicious.If you want to eat some authentic western brunch, I will recommend you.",False
Bottleless 是個很好的驚喜。創意美食簡單而現代，但精緻且性價比高。我喜歡大沙拉。鰤魚本來可以更好。魚是熱的，但盤子上的所有其他元素都是冰箱冷的！味道不錯，但由於溫度不同，有點奇怪。比爾在幸運餅乾裡得到了！創意觸感。服務非常好：休閒、優雅、周到。,"Bottleles is a good surprise.Creative food is simple and modern, but exquisite and cost -effective.I like big salads.The catfish can be better.The fish is hot, but all the other elements on the plate are cold in the refrigerator!The taste is good, but because the temperature is different, it is a bit strange.Bill got it in lucky biscuits!Creative touch.The service is very good: leisure, elegance, and thoughtful.",False

"這是一次積極的用餐體驗。工作人員很友好，很高興他們讓你品嚐你感興趣的葡萄酒。
然而，我認為食物勝過酒品。我嘗試了兩種起泡酒和黑皮諾。沒有什麼對我來說真正引人注目。此外，我發現當酒單沒有列出酒的名稱、製造商、地區或風味特徵時，它的幫助不大。
早午餐菜單很簡單，但很關鍵。西蘭花沙拉充滿了驚喜。它有很好的柑橘味，我喜歡燒焦的味道。
雞肉和餅乾（照片中沒有）也很棒。不過，一定要索取肉汁（要額外收費）。這真是個遊戲規則的改變者！ （太糟糕了，我們的女服務員對我們想要一份肉汁不太高興，但最終她確實要了我們）。
總的來說，我們度過了愉快的時光，並想回來嘗試晚餐。","This is a positive dining experience.The staff is very friendly, and I am glad that they let you taste the wine you are interested in.

The lunch menu is simple, but it is critical.The broccoli salad was full of surprises.It has a good citrus flavor, and I like to burnt.

良好的氛圍和良好的服務。炸雞可以搭配另一面——與烤餅（或他們所說的餅乾）的組合太多了，應該添加一些蔬菜。,"Good atmosphere and good service.The fried chicken can be paired with the other side -there are too many combinations with the barbecue (or the cookies they call), and some vegetables should be added.",False

食物和酒都很棒！這個地方的氣氛非常好，有開放式廚房和酒吧。然而，我們對服務有點失望，因為他們缺乏熱情，沒有真正解釋菜餚或提供很多關於葡萄酒的建議。他們在 22:25 來到我們的餐桌前，多次告訴我們他們要關門了，我們需要離開，儘管我們還在吃甜點。我們是22點40分出發的，所以感覺有點匆忙。我仍然非常推薦這個地方，因為食物很美味而且品質很高。,"Food and wine are great!The atmosphere in this place is very good, with open kitchen and bar.However, we are a little disappointed with services because they lack enthusiasm, do not really explain dishes or provide a lot of suggestions on wine.They came to our table at 22:25 and told us that they were going to close, and we needed to leave, although we were still eating desserts.We started at 22:40, so we felt a little hurried.I still recommend this place very much because the food is delicious and high.",False

餐廳的服務很好。  食物很美味。  然而預訂的過程並不愉快。  當我打電話預訂並給出電話號碼和客人人數時，對方說，你確定有5位客人嗎？在您之前的 2 次訪問中，您超額預訂了，並且到場人數比您的預訂少了 1 人。  我說過沒有人可以控制人們是否因為家庭緊急情況等情有可原的情況而在最後一刻取消。   他說得好像我是故意的。  後來又回我電話說最低消費是2500。假設政策改變。  然後他對我這麼說感到震驚。  當然不是，是整張桌子的。  我在他應該有我的賬單歷史之前就已經去過那裡了……所以我確信我之前的訪問已經超過了每人的最低消費。  因此，除非政策發生變化，否則第二次致電是不必要的，只會進一步惡化預訂體驗。  我說你之前斥責我少了一個人，現在又斥責我最低消費了。  他堅稱他不是在訓斥我。  我阻止了他，說這已經足夠預訂餐桌了。,"The restaurant's service is very good.The food is delicious.However, the booking process is not happy.When I call to book and give the phone number and the number of guests, the other party said, are you sure there are 5 guests?In your previous two visits, you have reservations, and the number of people present is one less than your booking.I have said that no one can control whether people are canceled at the last moment because of their family emergency situations.He said it seemed to be intentional.Later, I called me and said that the minimum consumption was 2500.Assume that policy changes.Then he was shocked to me.Of course not, it is the entire table.I have been there before he should have my bill of history ... so I am convinced that my previous visit has surpassed the minimum consumption of each person.Therefore, unless the policy changes, it is unnecessary for the second time, and it will only further deteriorate the booking experience.I said that you have rebuked me less than one person before, and now you blame me to the minimum consumption.He insisted that he was not reprimanding me.I stopped him and said that it was enough to book a dining table.",False

在這裡吃完晚餐後印象深刻。  總共嘗試了7 道菜，幾乎每道菜都很棒- 特別喜歡琥珀魚酸橘汁醃魚配一些美味的柚子，海鮮燴飯配上健康劑量的i Kira（我忘記了它的名字），茄子，這樣的例子不勝枚舉。  唯一的遺憾是鮭魚主菜，我認為這道菜太瘦了，煮得有點過頭，使它有點太硬和鮭魚味。  即使是啤酒單也很好，雖然很小，但總是對醜陋的一半朦朧感到滿意。  一定會回來！,"I was impressed after dinner here.I tried a total of 7 dishes, almost every dish is great-I especially like the nulbotic orange juice pickled fish with some delicious grapefruit, seafood risotto with a healthy dose i kira (I forgot its name), eggplant Such examples are endless.The only regret is the main dish of salmon.

美味的食物。專業服務👍,Delicious food.Professional service 👍,False
"早午餐點了三道不同的菜色：

1：瓶裝雞肉三明治

味道很一般，麵包的外觀和味道就像是從隔壁的7-11買的，這道菜唯一的優點是薯條，意外地美味。

2：短肋雜碎

擺盤很漂亮，味道也很棒，但是吃到一半，我開始覺得馬鈴薯和排骨的分量不平衡，太多的澱粉讓這道菜幾乎無法下嚥。對於這道菜中提供的蛋白質含量來說，價格有點高。

3：炸雞和餅乾

餅乾做得很好，調味也很好，雞肉對我的口味來說有點煮過頭了，雞肉的味道也很混合，也許廚師應該嘗試在前一天晚上把雞肉醃一下，以獲得更多的味道。

整體評分：3/5","Somalonal lunch has three different dishes:

1: Bottle chicken sandwiches

The taste is very average. The appearance and taste of the bread are bought from 7-11 next door. The only advantage of this dish is the fries, which is unexpectedly delicious.

2: Short ribs mixed

The plate is very beautiful and the taste is great, but half of it, I started to feel that the weight of potatoes and pork ribs was unbalanced. Too many starch made this dish almost unable to swallow.For the protein content provided in this dish, the price is a bit high.

3: fried chicken and biscuits

The biscuits are made very well and the flavoring is also very good. Chicken is a bit cooked for my taste, and the taste of chicken is very mixed. Maybe the chef should try to marinate the chicken the night before to get more flavors.

Overall score: 3/5",False
提供美味的食物和體面的服務，這對我來說是最好的之一。,Providing delicious food and decent services is one of the best for me.,False
這裡的氣氛和服務都很棒，但不幸的是食物沒有我想像的那麼好。我點了幾道菜，其中之一是早午餐菜單“牛排和雞蛋”，描述說這是和牛a9牛肉。但是牛肉太乾了。也許我只是運氣不好才得到那個。我點了炸雞和餅乾，雞肉很淡。五花肉和排骨還可以。,"The atmosphere and service here are great, but unfortunately, the food is not as good as I think.I ordered a few dishes, one of them was the lunch menu ""Steak and Eggs"", describing that this was Hetao A9 beef.But the beef is too dry.Maybe I only got that lucky luck.I ordered fried chicken and biscuits, and the chicken was very light.Pork belly and pork ribs are okay.",False

店裡氣氛溫馨，所有的工作人員都很友善。我點的chilaquiles裡有微甜的台灣玉米，味道與其他食材和醬汁很平衡，非常美味。食物的量對一個女人來說有點太多了，所以我認為兩三個人點不同的菜餚是個好主意。我還想再去那裡吃飯。,"The atmosphere in the store is warm, and all staff are friendly.I ordered Chilaquiles to have a slightly sweet Taiwanese corn.

對非亞洲人不友善。我去過那裡兩次，兩次都是在商務會議之後，沒有任何問題。我今天去那裡時沒有穿商務裝，我是下午 2:05 走進去的。有人告訴我他們下午 2 點停止服務。我問他們是否可以為我做點什麼......我被告知「你可以喝酒」。網站明確指出他們在下午 3 點停止服務。明顯的歧視。非常失望。我不會在這種地方爭著付錢。,"Not friendly to non -Asians.I have been there twice, two times after the business meeting, there are no problems.I didn't wear a business dress when I went there today, I walked in at 2:05 pm.Someone told me that they stopped service at 2 pm.I asked them if they could do something for me ...

良好的氛圍和服務，中等融合美食，第二次來這裡，但仍然不足為奇……在我看來，這只是另一個普通的餐廳。菜色大多比較油膩，如果你喜歡油炸的東西，這是一個值得一去的好地方。有限的菜單對我來說很好，但不幸的是不符合我的口味。就價值而言，Gen Creative 在各方面都更好。,"A good atmosphere and service, medium integration of food, come here for the second time, but it is still not surprising ...

很好吃。這是在這裡住了7年以來第三個餐廳的菜單上有「當地鱒魚」。這是最好的，但仍然不確定什麼是“本地鱒魚”。工作人員給我看了一張虹鱒魚或非常相似的東西的照片，她認為這是農場飼養的。我想要更多資訊。,"It's delicious.This is the ""local catfish"" on the menu of the third restaurant since I lived here for 7 years.This is the best, but it is still not sure what is ""local catfish"".The staff showed me a photo of rainbow catfish or very similar things.
