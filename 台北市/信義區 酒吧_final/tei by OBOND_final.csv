作為開始 5.紅韻黃茶的清新感非常棒！很有趣的組合，本來擔心花果組成很多會偏甜，意外的清新爽口。
第二杯15.蜜香紅茶上層奶蓋，富有綿密又濃郁的奶香，真的是難以忘懷。我不喜歡薑，但薑的一絲香氣不會顯得違和。個人沒嚐出微苦，反倒覺得起司微鹹香中帶著甜~

外面很低調，穿越幽暗的長廊後，來到茶室聽服務生介紹奉茶，倒了一杯迎賓茶後，領我們穿過一扇門才是真的進到裡面。

一開始看照片想像是靜謐的氛圍，比想像中的更可以用比正常音量稍大點聲音交談，座位間距離近。

"＊調酒：推薦06(直接喝就挺喜歡的，配上抹茶粉滋味更提升)、青蘋果特調(氣泡感、尾韻帶薑)

這天試了十多款都蠻特別的，印象深刻的是石頭(鮮蚵和番茄)、土壤(根莖味明顯)、No17(有隱藏版第二階段嗅味覺體驗)、和No15(像甜點的一杯哈密瓜和北海道起司)。嚐鮮挺有趣但我還是最愛06😆

＊餐點：推薦皮蛋豆腐(概念來自義大利餐點，皮蛋豆腐做成慕斯底下藏著肉片搭配解膩的酸菜，風味美妙難以忘懷)；封肉(切薄片不油膩、配蘿蔔絲和白芝麻，讓人好想搭一小口白飯啊)

舒肥醉雞也挺好醬料蠻喜歡的、油封鴨三明治起司牽絲吐司夠脆趁熱吃很優(旁邊的醬菜超重要讓整體味覺豐富許多)、月見麵非常非常辣上桌時會附牛奶和麵筋(原先困惑但吃了一口後就完全明白)、炸醬麵和杏鮑菇就比較普通了。Btw, 他們家麵食都偏硬，不知道喜歡偏軟能不能調整

＊服務和環境：服務無話說的好，儘管是試營運期間，依然絲毫不馬虎，每道餐點、每杯酒都詳盡的介紹。老闆也在現場和各桌客人聊天，自信但又親切。環境打造的十分雅緻，喜歡奉茶的機關、和前廳大張茶桌營造的氛圍，彷彿真的來到了間茶館品茗。是所有感官都相當滿足的一場體驗。樂意再訪，謝謝招待！","＊ Bart -up: Recommended 06 (I like it directly, I like it, the taste of matcha powder is more improved), the green apple special (bubble feel, tail rhyme ginger)

I tried more than a dozen models on this day, which was very special. The impressive was stones (fresh crickets and tomatoes), soil (obvious rhizome flavor), NO17 (with the second phase of the hidden version of the smell experience), and NO15 (like desserts of the dessert A cup of campaign and Hokkaido cheese).It's interesting to try something early, but I still love 06

＊ Meal: Recommend preserved egg tofu (the concept comes from the Italian meal, the preserved egg tofu is made into mousse with a piece of meat with a piece of fried sauerkraut, the flavor is beautiful and unforgettable); Sesame, people really want to take a small mouthful of rice)

Shu Fei Drunk Chicken is also pretty good. The oil seal duck sandwich cheese cheese toast is crispy enough to eat while it is hot (the sauce next to it is very important to make the overall taste a lot). It will be attached to milk and gluten (it was originally confused but fully understood after taking a bite), fried noodles and Pleurotus eryngii.BTW, their noodles are hard, I don’t know if they like soft or not

香片紹興酒63度雞胸
這兩道真的是大推，肉非常的軟嫩，味道又非常帶勁，喜歡口味重一點的人可以吃香片紹興酒雞胸，真的吃得停不下來

隱藏的椒香冷麵（有點不確定名字）的辣跟茶油辣椒子月見麵條那道真的都辣，辣的方式不太一樣，一種是花椒麻麻的那種辣帶香、另一個因為我已經被辣到吃不出來了，兩個辣的程度對我來說差不多。
另一道油封鴨的三明治覺得比較還好，但因為看到油封鴨就會想試試。加了三明治後其實吃不太到裡面的風味，也可能是因為我點了太多東西有點味覺疲乏，有機會再來嘗試。

茶酒的部分分別點了2.3.6.7.另一杯沒拍到想不起來

金萱綠茶的花生油味道蠻明顯的，然後裡面的冰球果凍要趁冰的時候吃完比較好，退冰後吃會是另一個世界。

其他沒寫不是不好喝，是因為不小心更認真在吃東西了，餐點真的有好吃。

空間的氣質照理說應該是文雅的品茶（雖然這裡是茶酒），訂位說明也有說不宜大聲喧嘩。如果就是想約朋友來大聊特聊各種八卦真的不適合這樣的地方，我相信沒有人想要在跟朋友聊的正嗨卻被其他桌或服務人員提醒。消費者有消費者的權益但店家也有自己的堅持，為了有更好的用餐體驗真的需要大家的努力🙈🙈

可以試試將空間的音樂放的小聲一點，說不定會讓人比較有意識的壓低音量。

The hidden pepper fragrance (a bit uncertain name) spicy and tea oil pepper Ziyue meeting strip is really spicy. The spicy way is not the same. Because I was so spicy that I couldn't eat it anymore, the two spicy levels were almost the same.
Another sandwiched duck's sandwich feels better, but I want to try it because I see the oil sealing duck.After adding sandwiches, the flavor that is not enough to eat is actually because I ordered too many things to have a little smell, and I have the opportunity to try again.

The part of the tea wine was ordered 2.3.6.7 respectively. The other cup couldn't remember

Jin Xuan Green Tea's peanut oil tastes quite obvious, and then the ice hockey jelly inside is better to eat while ice, and it will be another world after retreating.

Others are not bad because they are accidentally eating more seriously, and the meal is really delicious.

The temperament of the space is to say that it should be elegant tea (although this is tea wine), and there are also no loud noise.If you just want to ask friends to talk about all kinds of gossip, you are really not suitable for such places. I believe no one wants to talk to his friends and is reminded by other tables or service staff.Consumers have the rights and interests of consumers, but the store also has their own persistence.

說真的我都還蠻喜歡的，

熱壓吐司也都在水準～
唯獨沒在菜單裡的拌麵
口味比較一般般，麵口感偏硬！

整體而言算是個很棒的體驗！

Back to the space part, there are many thoughts before entering the main space. After using the lights of the corridor to slowly calm down, enter the Japanese -style space to show the design of the Japanese and modern fusion. At the same time, the need for unsuitable to play.

經過幽暗的長廊，開啟門的那刻，你不會覺得這裡是酒吧，像是世外桃源，最吸引眼球的莫過於日式涼亭席，感覺坐在上面喝酒格外愜意，很幸運的Joe除了日式涼亭席外也有換到吧台區，簡單的小互動，當茶裝滿的那一刻，大門緩緩開啟，門後又是另一個世界，台式的裝潢風格，古早味的餐櫥酒櫃，整體用餐氣氛真的非常舒適。﻿
﻿
另外不得不說的就是服務上面，除了酒單上能看到的素材，每一杯富有茶香的酒到客人桌上時，服務員用淺而易懂的詞彙，訴說著這杯的發想，酒液經過舌根時不經讚嘆一聲amazing😯﻿
﻿
以下為Joe推薦來到Tei必點的﻿
#紅玉紅茶﻿
Joe覺得這杯的層次非常豐富，咖啡、紅酒、茶香味、甜味，尾韻又有點苦味，當服務員噴上自製的醋，又是另一種風味的展線，酒體變的更為溫順，當杯中的冰塊漸漸融水後，又是更清爽的風格，主推這杯👍﻿【圖3】
﻿
#DaySpecial青蘋果﻿
Joe本身就喜歡Botanist Gin，帶點氣泡感的特調，清爽也不會太甜，當第一杯Joe非常推薦。【圖2】（此杯不在酒單上，為當日限定特調）﻿
﻿
#皮蛋豆腐舒肥豬里肌﻿
別看照片上沒有什麼料，真正好吃的是把皮蛋打成像慕斯，加上最底層軟嫩的豬里肌，這道料理最精華的部分是甜洋蔥搭配上皮蛋慕斯，那個美味的口感令人驚艷，真的太好吃了。﻿【圖6】
﻿
#劉奶奶祖傳炸醬家常麵﻿
不會死鹹的獨特醬汁，拌一拌大口一吃，人間美味﻿【圖7】

Joe覺得Tei給了酒另一種方式呈現，更深入的讓客人了解這杯酒的初衷，同時結合台灣的茶葉文化，食材也是使用最新鮮，用餐環境也寬敞不會擁擠，來到Tei你／妳需要留2個小時的時間來認識這裡，細細品嚐茶與酒液上的藝術，讚嘆這新的視覺與味覺饗宴。﻿

Tei visual and taste feasts, the art of tea and wine, is like an immersive experience in Tei By Obond. Decoration, food, and bartending all make JOE amazing.﻿
﻿
After the dark promenade, the moment you open the door, you will not think that this is a bar, like a paradise, the most eye -catching is the Japanese -style pavilion seat. I feel that sitting on it and drinking is extremely comfortable. There are also changes to the bar area outside the gazebo. Simple small interaction. When the tea is filled, the door is slowly opened, and the door is another world. The meal atmosphere is really comfortable.﻿
﻿
In addition, what I have to say is the service on the service, in addition to the material that can be seen on the wine list, every cup of tea with a tea fragrance on the guest table, the waiter uses a shallow and easy -to -understand vocabulary to tell the thoughts of this cup. When the liquid passes through the tongue, it is not admired by amazing😯

The following is a must -see for Joe to TEI
#红 #红 红 红
Joe thinks that the level of this cup is very rich, coffee, red wine, tea flavor, sweetness, and tail rhyme is a bit bitter. When the waiter sprays homemade vinegar, it is another flavor of the exhibition. After the ice cubes in the cup gradually melt the water, it is a more refreshing style.

#DaySpecial Green Apple
Joe itself likes Botanist Gin, with a little bubble, refreshing is not too sweet, when the first cup of Joe is very recommended.[Figure 2] (This cup is not on the wine list, it is a limited special adjustment on the day)

Overall evaluation ✍🏻
Joe thinks that TEI has given wine another way to present it. Let the guests understand the original intention of this glass of wine. At the same time, combined with Taiwan's tea culture, the ingredients are also used, and the dining environment is also spacious. You need to stay for 2 hours to meet here, taste the art of tea and liquor in detail, and admire this new visual and taste feast.﻿

"2020年底開幕的茶酒創新實驗室，目前還在試營運期間，不開放訂位，但抱著姑且一試的心情竟然訂到了！而且還是涼亭席(但要脫鞋而且女生穿裙子會不太方便就是)

店面有兩個空間，大門一進來就是包含涼亭的茶室，開了另一扇門才真的有來到bar的感覺，兩邊音樂風格也截然不同。

最推薦15號蜜香紅茶，用人頭馬V.S.O.P.做基底，輔以法國香橙干邑甜酒，又用北海道起司去做成奶蓋感，還帶有一點哈密瓜香氣。平常愛喝奶蓋類手搖的酒鬼朋友絕對不能錯過！

There are two spaces on the store. As soon as the gate comes in, it is a tea room containing the gazebo. It feels that the other door really came to BAR. The music style on both sides is also very different.

The most recommended No. 15 Honey Black Tea, uses the head of the horse V.S.O.P. as the base, supplemented by the French orange cognac sweet wine, and uses Hokkaido cheese to make the milk cover. It also has a little cantaloupe aroma.Bacchus friends who usually love to drink milk cover must not miss it!

"台灣茶酒一直是台灣調酒界經常會提到的部分，卻很少酒吧讓台灣的茶葉好好的傳承與融合與酒之中，而在這邊卻搭配不一樣的味道，每一杯就像是天作之合，似乎回到天地人和的千萬世界。在來到這邊我已經被非常多調酒師推薦這裡，不過因為繁忙一直沒來，直到一次找路，用Google Map定位自己時，發現我就在它門口，低調又安靜的門口，也讓我開始思索起一場偶遇，因為這場偶遇開起了一段旅程，並且堅定了我的所在，往往有些東西，在很想要的時候遲遲未來，而在無限場際遇中，有緣一定會出現。

"重點：完全沒有服務可言，老闆只想被捧，遇到顧客差評的態度就是狡辯到底。這家店已經試營運一年左右了，附近有很多很棒的酒吧，請跳過這家。

2/12訂了晚上八點的位子，訂位時收到落落長的訊息交待細節。以下是當天消費後讓我們不舒服的地方。
1.我跟同行友人八點準時到門口發現店家還在準備中。怎麼好意思要求顧客準時，結果店家晚開門讓一堆客人在門口群聚呢？
2.點了月見麵跟皮蛋豆腐，用餐時店員詢問餐點還可以嗎？我們一致表示皮蛋豆腐口味不合，只吃了兩口。店員僅表示：好，知道了。便離開。不懂是在問什麼意思欸？
3.當天位置是茶室的中島。我跟友人聊天的時候會一直被前方的店員與店員間聯繫聲影響，如：問訂位本在哪？拿著筆按彈簧發出答、答的聲響...老闆在我們前方對著門口大聲說哈嘍～～～整個聊天過程超、不、舒、服！
4.店家對自己的酒單搭配很自豪，我第二杯點了茶枝，老闆建議我點17號酒，原因：我們比較好介紹。而後同行友人第二杯點了17號則被服務人員建議等第三杯再點。我們依然要第二杯就點17後，朋友跟我抱怨了一句：店員幹嘛一直管我們啊？結果這句抱怨被店員聽到還記恨。
5.第二杯酒喝到一半，當天最胖的服務人員（後來被告知是老闆本人）來打斷我們對話，友人當下即告知：我們聊天的時候不喜歡被打斷。過了五秒後胖服務人員再次打斷我們詢問怎樣算打斷？友人：就是現在這樣。
隨即胖服務人員用非常不悅的語氣回：好，我再也不會跟你們講話了。
6.上述第五點發生後感到非常不舒服，便在結帳後跟現場另一位店員反應，店員告知我們，胖服務人員是老闆，老闆會這樣跟我們對話是有來龍去脈的，也就是他剛剛建議我們第二杯不要點17號時，友人的抱怨他聽到了。
我真的不懂，店家要建議是店家的事情，顧客可以不接受。而且友人對我抱怨，跟你們的情緒、沒禮貌的應對到底有什麼關係？
後續由老闆來跟我們對話，就如其他評論說到的，老闆遇到顧客在網路上給評論覺得不尊重店家；而我們在現場反應的結果就是聽老闆找一堆藉口、狡辯說他沒有惡意，他不知道到底要怎麼處理我們的反應........
並強調他們店還在試營運中，請包容這些不完美的地方。

我非常後悔當天浪費時間跟金錢在這家店。
於是花了時間寫這篇評論建議大家不要去這家「試營運」一年的店，附近有很多很多氣氛跟調酒都很優秀，已正式營運的店家。
不是為了再看老闆狡辯回應～而且老闆還會懷疑留差評的人真的有去光顧嗎？附上發票證明我真的有消費餒！","Key points: There is no service at all. The boss just wants to be held. The attitude of encountering a bad review of customers is to quibble to the end.This shop has been operating for about a year. There are many great bars nearby. Please skip this one.

2/12 Book the seat at 8 o'clock in the evening, and receive the details of the information to explain the details.The following is a place that makes us uncomfortable after consumption that day.
1. I went to the door at the door at the door and found that the store was still preparing at eight o'clock.How do you want to ask customers to be on time. As a result, the store opened the door late to let a bunch of guests gather at the door?
2. Click the moon to meet with preserved egg tofu. Is it okay to ask the meal during the meal?We unanimously said that the taste of preserved eggs and tofu was inconsistent, and we ate only two.The clerk only said: Okay, you know.Then leave.Don't understand what you mean?
3. The position of the day was the middle island of the tea room.When I chat with my friends, I will always be affected by the contact between the clerk and the clerk in front. For example, where is the book?Holding the sound of the answer and answering the sound of the spring ... The boss said loudly to the door in front of us ~~~ The whole chat process was super, no, comfortable, and convinced!
4. The store is very proud of his wine list. I ordered the tea branch in the second cup. The boss suggested that I order the No. 17 wine. The reason: We are better to introduce.Then the second cup of the same friends ordered the third cup of the service personnel to recommend the third cup again.We still want to order 17 after the second cup. My friend complained with me: Why do the clerk keep in charge of us?As a result, the complaint was remembered by the clerk.
5. Drink half of the second glass of wine. The fattest service staff (later was told as the boss himself) to interrupt our conversation. Friends told that we did not like to be interrupted when we were chatting.After five seconds, the fat service staff interrupted again how we asked how to interrupt?Friends: That's it now.
Then the fat service staff returned in a very unpleasant tone: Okay, I will never speak to you anymore.
6. After the fifth point of the above, I felt very uncomfortable, so I reacted with another clerk at the scene after checkout. The clerk told us that the fat service staff was the boss, and the boss would talk to us in this way. It is recommended that when we do n’t want to click on the 17th, my friend complained that he heard it.
I really do n’t understand. The store must recommend that it is the store's business, and customers can accept it.And my friends complained to me, what is the relationship with your emotions and rude response?
After the boss came to talk to us, as other comments mentioned, the boss encountered the customer and felt disrespectful to the shop on the Internet. He didn't know how to deal with our reaction ...
And emphasized that their shop is still in trial operation, please tolerate these imperfect places.

I regret that I waste time and money in this shop that day.
So I spent time to write this comment. I suggest you not go to this ""trial operation"" store for a year. There are many, many atmosphere and bartending shops nearby.

備受期待的開門儀式原本是為了成為一個獨特的亮點，結果卻感覺像是主題樂園團體旅遊。迎賓員將 3 個人聚集在一起進行一次介紹，卻沒有按照預期為每個人提供歡迎茶。在整個訪問過程中，伺服器可以付出更多努力來了解我們的喜好，提供個人化的建議，或與我們互動以創造難忘的體驗。

混合了多種元素的茶雞尾酒提供了獨特的風味，儘管它們可能掩蓋了原始茶的味道。最終，這完全取決於個人喜好。

酒吧顯示出巨大的潛力，但需要提高對細節和服務品質的關注，以確保整體體驗物有所值，並與其著名的雞尾酒品質保持一致。","Unfortunately, the experience of this bar's creation failed to reach its commitment.Decoration, magnificent entrances, repeated award -winning cocktails, and even minimum charges have laid the foundation for special experience.However, enthusiastic hospitality failed to meet these expectations.From the welcome members at the door to other waiters, the staff rely on conventional script -enough, but lacks the skills required to improve the overall experience.

The highly anticipated door opening ceremony was originally to become a unique highlight, but the result was like a theme park group tour.The welcome members gathered three people to introduce it, but did not provide everyone with welcome tea as expected.Throughout the visits, the server can work more to understand our preferences, provide personalized suggestions, or interact with us to create an unforgettable experience.

Mixed tea cocktails provide a unique flavor, although they may cover the taste of the original tea.In the end, this depends entirely on personal preferences.

這些天我對台灣的雞尾酒界印象真的越來越深刻。我在這裡嘗試的每一種雞尾酒都恰到好處——我特別喜歡我最後喝的一杯哈密瓜雞尾酒和北海道牛奶蓋。事實上，我們幾週前就參觀過這個地方，事實上我仍然記得那天晚上我喝的東西，這確實說明了這些飲料是多麼令人難忘。也看看這個空間有多漂亮！ 10/10 對我來說🙌🏼 …,"These days I have become more and more impressed with Taiwan's cocktail industry.Every cocktail I tried here is just right -I particularly like a cup of cantaloupe cocktail and Hokkaido milk cover I drank.In fact, we visited this place a few weeks ago.

"我對這家雞尾酒吧的前提很感興趣——全部以台灣當地茶為基礎，並融入了茶道。可悲的是，我並不認為處決已經完成。

整個體驗似乎被創造得非常獨特。每天有兩次入場時間，並分配結束時間。你到達前面，被告知當你的一杯茶從機器裡倒滿時，門將如何打開，聽起來很宏偉，但每張桌子只能喝一杯，一旦你知道該怎麼做，就完成了。我們都認為這是一個演示，而不是真正的交易，然後我們很失望，我們不得不共享一個玻璃。

菜單上——我和我的伴侶都是素食主義者，這意味著我們也不食用來自蜜蜂的蜂蜜。 80%的雞尾酒都含有蜂蜜！服務員告訴我們，他們對食譜沒有任何改變，這意味著許多產品對我們來說都是禁區。為什麼不用糖、楓糖漿、龍舌蘭花蜜或任何其他甜的東西來代替它呢？我感覺到這又是一種「特殊」「排他性」類型的事物 - 可悲的是，這是以犧牲動物為代價的，這對我來說沒有什麼特別的，恰恰相反。請想想環境、動物和您多樣化的客戶群。奢侈不是透過剝削動物來體現的。更不用說食物菜單不包括任何素食。

總的來說，這些雞尾酒很有趣，但我們發現，對於以茶為主的雞尾酒吧，當與威士忌或波本威士忌等烈酒混合時，茶的香氣就會消失。我確實很喜歡帶有八角茴香和五香粉的那種，但同樣，茶的背景太多了，這真的很遺憾。

我還發現，這家酒吧的目的是在您到達時將自己推銷為一個奢華而神秘的地方，但當您進入時，這種感覺就完全消失了。主房間時尚簡約，外觀乾淨，但你與其他顧客的距離太近，以至於失去了那種特殊的感覺。它最終就像普通酒吧一樣，標價極高，每人最低訂購金額為 900 美元。","I am very interested in the premise of this cocktail bar -all based on local tea in Taiwan and incorporate the tea ceremony.Sadly, I don't think the execution has been completed.

The entire experience seems to be created very unique.There are twice admission time and allocating time.When you arrive in front, you are told when your cup of tea is filled with the machine, how the door will open, it sounds magnificent, but each table can only drink one cup. Once you know what to do, it is done.We all think that this is a demonstration, not a real transaction, and then we are disappointed. We have to share a glass.

On the menu -I and my partner are vegetarians, which means that we do not eat honey from bees.80%of cocktails contain honey!The waiter told us that they have not changed any recipes, which means that many products are the restricted area for us.Why not use sugar, maple syrup, lipstay nectar or any other sweet things to replace it?I feel that this is another kind of ""special"" and ""exclusive"" type -sad thing is that it is at the expense of animals, which is not special for me, the opposite.Think about the environment, animals and your diverse customer base.Luxury is not reflected by exploiting animals.Not to mention that the food menu does not include any vegetarian food.

In general, these cocktails are very interesting, but we find that the aroma of tea will disappear when the cocktail bar domaining is the main cocktail bar, when mixed with whiskey or Buben whiskey.I really like the kind of octagonal fennel and spiced powder, but the same, the background of tea is too much, which is really regrettable.

I also found that the purpose of this bar is to sell yourself into a luxurious and mysterious place when you arrive, but when you enter, this feeling completely disappears.The main room is fashionable and simple, and the appearance is clean, but your distance from other customers is too close to lose that special feeling.It is like an ordinary bar in the end.
