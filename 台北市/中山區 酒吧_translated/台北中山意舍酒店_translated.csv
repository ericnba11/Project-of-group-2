"你飯店標榜四星
訂完房間，不會跟客人確認 前往時間跟是否訂房確定嗎？
這是你們一般的做法嗎？ …","Your restaurant advertises four stars
After the room is booked, do you not confirm whether the time is going to be or not to book a house?
Is this your general approach?Mowing"
"地點不錯離中山商圈都很近，連續住三天，房務整理很好😁,櫃台人員很親切。

（ps 大廳簡潔俐落，但小可惜沒有比較舒適空間可以待在那邊） …","The location is very close to the Zhongshan business district. It lives for three consecutive days. The housing affairs are well organized, and the counter staff is very kind.

(The PS Hall is simple and neat, but there is no more comfortable space to stay there) ..."
"在入住時櫃檯小姐很親切，也幫了許多忙！

我們住的是雙床房，空間不算大，不太能放下兩個人的行李箱。（一個大概就會擋住走道）適合帶著背包或小行李箱輕便出行的人。 …","The Miss Course was very kind and helped many busy at the time of check -in!

We live in double beds. The space is not large and can not let go of the suitcase of two people.(One will block the aisle) It is suitable for people who travel with a backpack or a small suitcase lightly.Mowing"
房間簡單乾淨，外面有交誼廳，如果多人組合住宿蠻方便，地點也不錯但是停車稍稍不方便，房間內有附厚實的浴袍，掛衣服空間夠大但是衣架不多，剛好遇到中秋節有多送兩個月餅，服務台人員看起來有點累，浴室門的防水壓條跟馬桶完全貼合導致都炸開了很不行，建議要提供止滑墊，以免滑倒，早餐普普通通,"The room is simple and clean, and there is a posterity outside the outside. If the multi -person combination is convenient, the location is good, but the parking is slightly inconvenient. There is a thick bathrobe in the room. There are two more moon cakes. The service desk staff looks a bit tired. The waterproof pressure bar and the toilet at the bathroom door are completely exploded. It is recommended to provide a slip mat"
"此次入住有些失望
1.行前致電酒店詢問停車場資訊，接電話的服務人員明確告知未提供停車場，要在附近自行尋找停車位，結果現場check in時被告知有停車場且就在酒店正後方只好再去移車。 …","Some disappointment this time
1. Call the hotel to ask the parking lot information before the trip. The service staff who answered the phone clearly informed that the parking lot was not provided and wanted to find the parking space by themselves. As a result, when checking in on the spot Moving.Mowing"
"飯店前面沒有地方可以暫停車子，就算只放行李就離開短短30秒，後面的車子也是會被我擋住過不去。

隔音不好，半夜12點聽隔壁房間的洗澡聲、唱歌聲、聊天聲一清二楚。 …","There is no place in front of the hotel to suspend the car. Even if you just put your luggage, you will leave in just 30 seconds. The car in the back will be blocked by me.

The sound insulation is not good. At 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, listen to the bathing sounds, singing, and chat.Mowing"
"交通方便
停車格比較少但提早去還是有位置
服務也還不錯 …","Convenient transportation
There are relatively few parking grid but there is still a place to go early
The service is pretty good ..."
"環境乾淨、配色優雅，家具和電器選品都不錯，特別喜歡沖茶機、電動窗簾和可連接藍芽的音響。
正好跟六月優惠，住過非常喜歡，即使非優惠期間也會考慮再入住。","The environment is clean, the color matching is elegant, and the furniture and electrical selection are good. I especially like to rush the tea machine, electric curtains and sound -connected Bluetooth sounds.
It happened to be in the June discount. I liked it very much, and I would consider staying again even during non -discounts."
位於中山北路上的高級飯店，附設於一樓的buttermilk美式餐廳，是個很有格調的用餐地點。餐點美味，服務也很到位，雖然價位偏高但物有所值，有錢有閒就能享受這種高品質的用餐服務。,"A high -end restaurant on the North Road in Zhongshan, an American restaurant attached to the first floor, is a very stylish dining place.The meal is delicious and the service is in place. Although the price is high, it is worth it. You can enjoy this high -quality dining service if you have money and leisure."
"訂2人房2客早餐，1人入住，1客早餐內用1客要求外帶餐盒被拒。覺得不合理。

沒有停車位也有點麻煩，但剛剛看前一篇寫說有停車位，這，更令人不悅了。
頓時服務從三星變二星","Book 2 people rooms and 2 guest breakfast, 1 person to check in, 1 customer breakfast for breakfast is required to take a lunch box to be rejected.I feel unreasonable.

It is a bit troublesome to have no parking space, but just read the previous article that there is a parking space, which is even more unpleasant.
Suddenly serving from Samsung to two stars"
"透過Alex經理介紹，入住體驗相當滿意，環境乾淨、空調恆溫穩定、連馬桶坐上去都是溫熱的，這個價位有ToTo讓我相當訝異，櫃檯人員親切快速的服務，然後一定要去餐廳用餐。炸雞真的是棒，一定要吃。
在這個價格帶，意舍是我住過最滿意的飯店。","According to Manager Alex, the check -in experience is quite satisfactory, the environment is clean, the air conditioner constant temperature is stable, and even the toilet is warm. This price has TOTO that makes me quite surprised. Dine.Fried chicken is really great, you must eat it.
At this price belt, Yishe is the most satisfactory restaurant I have lived."
房內空間不大，床舒適，但外面有公共空間可以坐著聊天吃東西，附近生活機能便利。停車場不好找，位子不多，但工作人員很nice會協助引導,"The space inside the room is not large and the bed is comfortable, but there is a public space outside to sit and eat, and it is convenient to live nearby.The parking lot is not easy to find, there are not many seats, but the staff is very nice to help guide"

台北中山區小而美的酒店，房間很乾淨、也很安靜，還有親切的工作人員，附設的洗衣房👍，可以少帶些衣服，大大減輕行李的重量🎒。 …,"The small and beautiful hotel in Zhongshan District, Taipei, the room is very clean and quiet. There are also kindergarten staff. The attached laundry room can bring less clothes to greatly reduce the weight of luggage.Mowing"
隔音超級好，整體整潔、空間規劃及裝潢很棒，空調溫度可有效調整，另有很不錯的藍芽喇叭！,"The sound insulation is super good, the overall cleanliness, the space planning and decoration are great, the air conditioner temperature can be effectively adjusted, and there are very good Bluetooth speakers!"
"出差到台北三天兩夜，第一次選擇中山意舍為兩個晚上的休息飯店。

兩天的住宿房間整潔乾淨衛生，設計感也不錯，床跟枕頭睡起來也很舒服。兩天住宿體驗中特別感謝Alex接待與熱情款待，整體而言感受非常好👍是一個值得再次住宿的飯店","On a business trip to Taipei for three days and two nights, the first time I chose Zhongshan Yishe as a rest hotel for two nights.

The two -day accommodation room was clean and clean, and the design was also good. The bed and pillow were also very comfortable.Thank you in the two -day accommodation experience. Thank you Alex for reception and enthusiasm. Overall, I feel very good."
"➡️房間乾淨整潔！
只是設計挺失敗的
上完廁所需要到外面洗手 😂

➡️停車場真的很扣分
諾大的飯店只有五個停車位
這次五點來飯店辦理入住
因為隔壁有包場的活動
所以停車場滿了，我必須去停外面的
飯店說以前有其他特約，現在沒了

非常抱歉…我當天的行程是晚上有酒局
所以我無法移車了
因此我就這樣停在外面一整天

➡️環保部分很推薦！
牙刷要記得跟櫃台說喔！可以提供給住客
非常環保♻️ 很棒

➡️住宿位置離捷運站很方便
建議要住中山意舍的朋友就不要自己開車了
搭捷運來的話會讓旅程整個加分！
❤️❤️","洁️ The room is clean and tidy!
It's just that the design failed
You need to wash your hands outside after you go to the toilet 😂

️ The parking lot is really deducted
There are only five parking spaces in Nuo Da's hotel
Come to the hotel at five o'clock this time to check in
Because there is an event next door
So the parking lot is full, I have to stop outside
The hotel said there were other specials before, but now it's gone

I'm very sorry ... My trip that day is that there is a wine bureau at night
So I can't move the car anymore
So I just stopped outside for a whole day

！️ The environmental protection part is very recommended!
Remember to say to the counter!Can be provided to the guest
Very environmentally friendly 很️ Very great

捷️ The accommodation location is very convenient to be from the MRT station
It is recommended that friends who live in Zhongshan Yishe don't drive by yourself
If you come to the MRT, you will add points to the entire journey!

"房間乾淨舒服，真的很乾淨，採光足夠，餐廳炸雞很好吃
會再來","The room is clean and comfortable, really clean, enough lighting, the fried chicken in the restaurant is delicious
Will come again"
"電視的網路極差，在看youtube時會一直斷線或跳出。
地點位置佳，床單舒適。","The Internet on the TV is extremely poor, and it will be broken or jumped out when watching YouTube.
The location is good and the sheets are comfortable."
很棒的體驗，交通方便、硬體設備好、有藍芽喇叭、聯網電視，還有可愛的迎賓點心🥺我想外國人來住也能有好的體驗，重點是不貴，推推～ …,"A great experience, convenient transportation, good hardware equipment, Bluetooth speakers, connected TVs, and cute welcome snacks. I think foreigners can have a good experience. The focus is not expensive, push ~ Mowing"
位在繁華的中山站附近，極好的住宿體驗，隔音好，床也十分舒適好睡，另外一樓的Buttermilk餐廳，更是吃過最好吃的炸雞，必須得大力推薦。然而不知是否是此區的蚊子特別多，連帶著飛進酒店的蚊子也多，光一個晚上就在房內打了4隻蚊子，另外提供的浴袍感覺也偏舊，建議可適宜汰舊換新。,"Located near the prosperous Zhongshan Station, the excellent accommodation experience, good sound insulation, and sleeping in the bed very comfortably. The Buttermilk restaurant on the first floor is the best fried chicken, and it must be highly recommended.However, I do n’t know if there are so many mosquitoes in this area, and there are many mosquitoes flying into the hotel. I just hit 4 mosquitoes in the room for a night. new."
"飯店營運整體舒適親切，營運經理Alex接待很熱情，相關問題回覆迅速熱心。
早餐特別推薦「炸雞🍗」！！
床和枕頭很舒適～","The restaurant's operation is comfortable and kind, the operating manager Alex is very enthusiastic, and the related issues are quickly and enthusiastic.
Breakfast is particularly recommended ""Fried Chicken""!Intersection
The bed and pillow are very comfortable ~"
"我覺得早餐好用心好讚，食物種類多樣化
盤子是9宮格，我第一次看過；食物的湯湯汁汁不會混在一起，而且可以一次拿9樣；很細膩的巧思，很棒","I think the breakfast is good and praised, and the types of food are diverse
The plate is 9 palace, I have seen it for the first time; the soup and sauce of the food will not be mixed together, and I can get 9 at a time; very delicate ingenuity, great"
設備、毛巾對於一晚5000真的對不上價格，老公睡了整晚過敏、流鼻水，完全沒有睡好。,"Equipment and towels are really not worth the price for 5000 a night. Her husband has been allergic and flowing nose water all night, and he has not slept well at all."
"地理位置非常方便，旁邊有許多超商及捷運站
當天因還有外帶年菜，飯店很貼心的幫忙加熱，晚上棉被很暖伙！也很安靜
須自行帶牙膏牙刷，飯店的熱水水量也很穩定！
覺得很適合小家庭、情侶住宿！","The geographical location is very convenient, there are many supermarkets and MRT stations next to it
Because there were still New Year's dishes that day, the restaurant helped to heat it very intimately, and the quilt was very warm at night!Also quiet
You must bring toothpaste toothbrush by yourself, and the hot water volume of the hotel is also very stable!
I think it is very suitable for small families and couples!"
家庭旅遊第一次入住，這次入住的是5樓的中房房型3間，飯店有附設一些車位，家人都很喜歡，房間的配置也很好，checkin時因尚未到達入住時間，櫃檯人員很好幫我們提早入住，很感謝，地理位置也很棒，離雙連捷運站蠻近的，還可以走去寧夏夜市，這次的入住體驗很棒，希望下次還有機會入住,"For the first time family tourism, there are 3 Zhonghe Housing -type rooms on the 5th floor. There are some parking spaces attached to the hotel. The family likes it very well. Good help us stay early, thank you very much, the geographical location is great, it is very close to the Shuanglian MRT station, and you can go to Ningxia Night Market."
Ivy服務很好，桌面一直幫我們保持的很乾淨，值得讚許👍 …,"The Ivy service is very good, the desktop has been helping us very clean, it is worthy of praise ..."
餐點很好吃，記得要先預訂，不然會白跑一趟喔,"The meal is delicious. Remember to book it first, otherwise you will run in vain"
除夕年夜飯，主菜有三個選項a.鮭魚+半隻龍蝦 b.牛排+半隻龍蝦 c.戰斧豬排+半隻龍蝦，搭配自助吧有烏魚子炒飯，炸物類，炒蔬菜，生菜吧，烤乳豬（冷的），三樣水果，三樣甜點，兩樣糖品，炸年糕，起司盤，冷熱飲，以年夜飯的價格來看並不貴，也算豐富，但主餐的龍蝦有些雷(烤太熟？冷凍太久?肉質不好），牛排很厚很軟，有些部位只有約3分熟，預定5分熟的，戰斧肉也太熟，很澀。除夕特別的節日，客人太多，對餐廚人員也很辛苦，是極大工作量。外場服務人員非常nice ，感謝中山意舍的工作人員犧牲與家人團聚時間，成就我們的團聚時光。,"On New Year's Eve, there are three options for main dishes a. Salmon+half lobster B. Steak+half lobster C. Tomahawk pork chop+half lobster. , Cold ones (cold), three fruits, three desserts, two sugar products, fried rice cakes, cheese dishes, hot and cold drinks. The lobster is thunderous (too cooked? It is frozen for too long? The meat is not good). The steak is very thick and soft. Some parts are only about 3 cooked. It is scheduled to be cooked with 5 points. Tomahawk meat is too cooked and astringent.There are too many guests on New Year's Eve, and there are too many guests, and it is also very hard for the kitchen staff. It is a great workload.The service staff in the field is very nice. Thanks to the staff of Zhongshan Yishe for sacrificing time to reunite with family members to achieve our reunion time."
"停車場太少，20個，滿了後只能自行停車。河景不錯。服務上有點冷淡，床感覺不大好移動後晃動有點大會互相干擾。電視提供youtube,但整個系統不好操作，會lag跟整個跳出系統。飯店設計感很好，但精緻度不夠。ae下還可，原價就有點不划算。7/10","There are too few parking lots, 20, and you can only park on your own after full.The river scenery is good.The service was a bit cold, and the bed felt that the shaking was a bit disturbed by each other after moving.The TV provides YouTube, but the entire system is not easy to operate, and LAG will jump out of the system.The hotel design is very good, but the refinement is not enough.Under AE, the original price is a bit cost -effective.7/10"
"飯店地理位子不錯，飯店還有附停車場（位子不多，不保留車位，先到先停）；房內還有一個小陽台(面停車場), 沒有什麼景觀啦⋯
房間內也提供 Stelle 藍芽音響，操作上都很方便
我們兩大一小入住算不上親子飯店，但空間使用上不會覺得太狹小；早餐就是在樓下的buttermilk摩登美式餐廳用餐（炸雞很好吃）","The geographical seat of the hotel is good, there are parking lots in the restaurant (there are not many seats, no parking spaces, first stop first); there is also a small balcony in the room (surface parking lot), there is no landscape ...
The room also provides Stelle Bluetooth audio, which is very convenient to operate
The two big and small stays in the parent -child restaurant, but the space will not feel too small; breakfast is the Buttermilk modern American restaurant downstairs to dine (fried chicken is delicious)"
"9/25入住酷景房，當初從網站上看到面對中山北路林蔭大道的窗景而下訂，實際入住開房完全沒有失望

入住前mail詢問店家可否在房間內慶生呢？很謝謝飯店給的生日小驚喜，房內佈置的很可愛，還有梳妝台上的小點心與小卡片，真的暖到心坎裡🫶🏻

地理位子很棒，飯店還有附停車場（位子不多，不保留車位，先到先停）

房間內也提供 Stelle 藍芽音響，操作上都很方便，音場環繞效果很不錯，在房間的時間幾乎都是開著聽音樂

無論是外縣市來訪住宿，或是想讓自己享受外宿一晚的新鮮感，都很推薦來此住上一晚","9/25 Check in the cool scenery room. At first, I saw the window view facing the Layin Avenue of Zhongshan North Road.

Before staying, Mail asked the store if he celebrated his birthday in the room?Thank you very much for the birthday surprise given by the hotel. The room is very cute, and the snacks and small cards on the dressing table are really warmer.

The geographical seat is great, there are also parking lots in the hotel (there are not many seats, do not keep the parking space, stop first) first)

The room also provides Stelle Bluetooth audio, which is very convenient to operate. The surrounding effect of the sound field is very good. The time in the room is almost open to listen to music

Whether it is visiting and accommodation in other counties and cities, or wanting to enjoy the freshness of one night of fangs, I recommend coming here for one night."
"12/2 入住體驗很差

1.走入飯店準備check-in，發現櫃檯人員完全沒有抬頭看客人

2.跟櫃檯人員詢問可否再給一床棉被，被回覆：「阿我們只有毛毯」，請問這是跟客人說話還是朋友？不用加敬語？不好意思，可以嗎？加一些友善的輔助用語對於服務業原來已經不是基本配備了嗎？

3.同住家人將行李寄在櫃檯，我在外用完餐先回飯店想先取行李，詢問櫃檯人員，沒想到臉超臭，還一副客人要找麻煩的臉，一直不願意幫忙查詢，我重複解釋了幾次，他們才願意拿出寄物的登記本查看，查看後還說沒有這件行李，我還要自己去指認行李，真的很不專業

4.硬體部分，房間超小（跟松山意舍一樣價位，房間及床都小超多）、冷氣完全不會涼、房間超悶、洗手乳加超多水超級稀

非常喜歡松山意舍，因為訂不到才嘗試入住了中山，很差的體驗。","12/2 The check -in experience is poor

1. Enter the hotel to prepare for Check-in, and find that the counter staff did not look up at the guests at all

2. Ask the counter staff if you can give a quilt again, and the response was replied: ""Ah, we only have a blanket."" Is this talking to guests or friends?No need to add respect?Sorry, can you?Add some friendly auxiliary terms, isn't the service industry basically equipped?

3. The family members sent the luggage at the counter. I went back to the hotel first after using meals and asked the counter personnel. I didn't expect the face to be stinky. I also had a guest to find a troublesome face. After repeated explanations, they were willing to take out the registration book of the sending object to check it. After viewing, I said that there is no such luggage. I have to identify my luggage by myself. It is really unprofessional.

4. The hardware part, the room is super small (the same price as the Songshan Yishe, the room and the bed are small and there are many), the air -conditioning will not be cold at all, the room is super stuffy, the hand washing milk, the superb water and the super sparse

I like Songshan Yishe very much, because I couldn't try to stay in Zhongshan because I couldn't order it. I had a poor experience."
"支付的費用有包含小朋友們，可惜的是小朋友們小失望…
沒有給小朋友的拖鞋…洗完澡光著腳在房間走來走去不舒服的！後來打給櫃台詢問，服務人員隔了一會兒補拖鞋。

水，只給大人的…我們就沒再詢問。

有看到之前的住客分享進房桌上有迎賓小點心，所以小朋友有小期待，但進房的時候什麼桌上什麼都沒有…😂","The fees paid include children, but unfortunately the children are disappointed ...
I didn't give the children slippers ... After taking a shower, they walked in the room and walked uncomfortable!Later, I called the counter and asked the service staff for a while to make up the slippers.

Water, we only give adults ... we didn't ask anymore.

I saw the former residents shared the snacks on the table, so the children had a small expectation, but when I entered the room, there was nothing on the table ... 😂"
"居然停水。早上7點又打電話吵醒顧客通知「有水了」。
房間小。
床小。
隔音差。
差不多的價位，可以選擇和逸民生，以後不會選擇中山意舍了。","Actually stop water.At 7 o'clock in the morning, I called and wake up the customer to inform ""there is water.""
The room is small.
The bed is small.
The sound insulation is poor.
At the same price, you can choose to live with Yimin, and you will not choose Zhongshan Yishe in the future."
"服務和地理位置都超好！
前臺的服務員日語都很棒👍
前臺哥哥推薦給我的飯店也很好吃。
下次來我想再住這裡。","The service and geographical location are super good!
The waiter at the front desk is great in Japanese
The restaurant recommended to me at the front desk is also delicious.
Next time I want to live here again."
"之前都住松山意舍，12/2第一次入住中山意舍，真是沒有比較沒有傷害。
1. 松山的櫃檯親切，經過的時候就會親切的打招呼，中山的一進去要辦理入住櫃檯連抬頭也不會。
2. 房間比起松山的小一半，服務態度也差一大截，有問題要詢問櫃台，櫃台一副不屑的態度，還以為是住到什麼三流酒店。
入住體驗極為差勁，完全沒有四星酒店的品質。","Before I lived in Songshan Yishe, I stayed in Zhongshan Yishe for the first time in 12/2. It was really not harmful.
1. The counter of Songshan is kind. When you pass it, you will say hello kindly. As soon as Zhongshan goes in, you will not even look up at the counter.
2. The room is half smaller than Songshan and the service attitude is a lot worse. If you have any questions, ask the counter. A disdainful attitude at the counter, thinking that it is a third -rate hotel.
The check -in experience is extremely poor, and there is no quality of the four -star hotel at all."
"房間網路wifi 不穩
電視無法收看一般頻道
浴室熱水很快就熱了水壓也很夠
早餐的部分很多樣化還有現做的餐點
服務人員也很親切","Room network wifi unstable
Can't watch the general channel on TV
The hot water in the bathroom is hot quickly and the water pressure is enough
There are many samples of breakfast and there are current meals
The service staff is also very kind"
"很棒且很用心的酒店，櫃檯人員很親切，入住前以及退房後有提供寄放行李的服務，房間住起來也很舒服、乾淨。
這次選擇中山意舍過紀念日，酒店貼心了提供佈置以及點心，來自國外的男友和我都覺得很驚喜，下次絕對會在入住的！！","The hotel with great and attentive counters is very kind. Before check -in and after check -up, there are services to store luggage, and the rooms are also very comfortable and clean.
This time I chose the Zhongshan Yishe on the anniversary. The hotel was intimately provided with the layout and snacks. My boyfriend from abroad and I felt very surprised. I will definitely stay in next time!Intersection"
"優點：
整體環境空間不錯，床的軟硬適中
早餐選擇豐富也算好吃，有肉蛋吐司和蛋料理可以選擇。

缺點：
1.913樓上有機房 晚上睡覺會發出一個頻率很吵，飯店提供耳塞，也說如果還是不行可以換房，這間有這個問題，就不應該提供給客人，會造成後續的麻煩和浪費時間。

2. 餐廳服務人員很冷淡，服務態度也沒有很好。","advantage:
The overall environment space is good, the hard and hard of the bed is moderate and moderate
Breakfast choices are rich and delicious. You can choose from meat egg toast and egg dishes.

shortcoming:
1.913 The organic room upstairs will send out a very noisy frequency at night. The hotel provides earplugs. It is also said that if you still can't change the house, this problem should not be provided to the guests, which will cause subsequent trouble and waste of time.

2. The restaurant service staff is very cold and the service attitude is not very good."
"我應該是第一個在評論稱讚餐廳歌單的人吧🤣

還不說住房，光是早餐整體體驗就喜歡到不行！餐廳播放的是2010年代西洋流行歌單，各種原唱和翻唱版本，心情好起來，胃口也跟著大開。

10/4週二早上8點多來吃早餐，幾乎是包場。早餐涵蓋美式（炸物、熱狗、烤麵包等，大推可頌！）、中式（粥品）、日式（味噌湯、壽司、漬物、還有冷豆腐！）、水果、脆片、飲品咖啡等也是必備。也有現煮的蛋料理，現場服務人員也都蠻親切～

10/3晚上入住707酷景房，當初是看網站上面對中山北路的窗景而下訂，實際開房也完全沒有失望。飯店還提供生日小驚喜，整體設計風格現代中帶有詼諧（床頭掛畫是穿西裝尤達大師🤣）；浴室洗手台獨立出來，結合梳妝台和點心吧，喜歡這種善用空間的設計巧思；備品用紙類包裝而非塑膠，這點也好讚！

房間也提供Stelle藍芽音響，操作上都很方便直覺，以房間裡還有隔著半面牆之下的音場環繞效果還是很不錯👍🏻幾乎是在房間的時間都開著聽音樂～

整體來說都沒有遇到前面評論提到的問題，對聲音、味道都敏感的我度過一夜好眠：隔音很好，空調的運轉聲也幾乎無感，隔天被陽光曬到自然醒，早上6點多就精神百倍，感到幸福。

唯一小小缺點是剛好遇上飯店無線網路壞掉（入住時服務人員有告知，但也無提供其他解決方式），不過現在都是用自己手機4G所以倒不算大問題。

無論是外縣市來訪住宿，或是想讓自己偶爾享受外宿住一晚的新鮮感，都非常推薦來此體驗～","I should be the first person to comment on the restaurant's song list.

Don't talk about housing, just like the overall breakfast experience!The restaurant was played by Western pop singles in the 2010s. Various originals and cover versions of them were in a good mood and appetite.

10/4 Tuesday at 8 o'clock in the morning for breakfast, almost in the charter.Breakfast covers American style (fried, hot dogs, grilled bread, etc., pushing can be pushed!), Chinese (porridge), Japanese style (miso soup, sushi, stains, cold tofu!), Fruits, crisps, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks Coffee, etc. are also necessary.There are also cooked egg dishes, and the on -site service staff are quite kind ~

10/3 evening, staying in the 707 cool view room. At first, it was viewed on the website of the website facing the window of Zhongshan North Road. The actual opening of the house was completely disappointed.The restaurant also provides a small birthday surprise. The overall design style is modern in modern times (the bedside painting is a master of a suit Youda); the bathroom hand -wash table is independently came out, combined with the dressing table and snacks, and like this kind of design that make good use of space. Ingredients; packed paper packages instead of plastic, which is also good!

The room also provides Stelle Bluetooth audio, which is very convenient to operate. In the room, there is a sound field around the half -face wall in the room.

Overall, I did n’t encounter problems mentioned earlier. I ’m sensitive to sound and taste. I am a hundred times more spiritual in the morning and feel happy.

The only small disadvantage is that it happened to meet the restaurant's wireless network (the service staff was notified, but there were no other solutions), but now it is not a big problem with your own 4G, so it is not a big problem.

Whether it is visiting accommodation in other counties and cities, or wanting to allow you to enjoy the freshness for one night, it is recommended to come here to experience ~"
房間整潔，有空間感。酒店為男友生日準備了小禮物及佈置，感謝。可步行去寧夏夜市。,"The room is neat and has a sense of space.The hotel has prepared a small gift and layout for her boyfriend's birthday, thanks.You can walk to Ningxia Night Market."
我是單人旅行，中山意舍離中山站不遠，也離夜生活的林森北不遠，可以算鬧中取靜，晚上回飯店的路上也都算是人多安全。我入住一中床無早餐方案。飯店很貼心依我的需求讓我住在最高樓層，感覺當天晚上沒有其他住客，所以還蠻安靜的，但是外面如果有大車（公車之類的）經過整棟樓都會共振不知為何，左右沒聽到鄰居，不過如果關門沒拉著關門聲就會很大。枕頭比較有支撐力我蠻喜歡的。樓層的休息區看起來很像冒險公會交誼廳蠻可愛的。總之我覺得沒有特別不好的地方，附近騎腳踏車坐公車吃飯也都蠻方便的，房價有優惠的時候還蠻值得住的。,"I am a single travel. Zhongshan Yishe is not far from Zhongshan Station. Lin Sen, who is also from nightlife, is not far from the north. It can be considered as quiet as you go back to the restaurant at night.I stay in a middle bed without breakfast plan.The restaurant is very intimate, according to my needs, I live in the highest floor. I feel that there are no other residents that night, so it is quite quiet, but if there are large cars (buses and the like) outside, I will resonate with the entire building. I didn't hear my neighbors, but it would be great if the door was closed without closing the door.I like the pillow more supportive. I like it.The rest area on the floor looks very cute like the adventure guild.In short, I don't think there is a particularly bad place. It is quite convenient to ride a bicycle by bicycle nearby. It is worth living when the house prices are favorable."
"能看到101的房型真的太棒了
非常喜歡💕","It's great to see the room type of 101
I like it very much 💕"
"整體是很不錯的住宿經驗，設備上不是到頂好，但又處處有感受到一些小細節帶來的貼心便利感，整合空間讓盥洗台面延長是我覺得最便利最喜歡的一點。雖然廁所偏小、但浴室空間夠，而且隨時有足夠水壓的冷熱水，浴室置物平台也做了小巧思方便放置+拿取洗髮沐浴品，提供的備品都是台灣的薑心比心也蠻好用的。備品提供牙刷和牙膏分開包裝我覺得非常好！因為自己有帶牙刷，可以只使用牙膏而不去拆封沒有要使用的牙刷。
窗戶內有遮光簾，讓人可以完完全全的休息不會被早上的陽光影響。
早餐提供也非常不馬虎，餐點選擇不少，且蠻多我喜歡吃的，有日式早餐還有現做吐司可以直接跟廚師點。
還有自助洗衣烘衣間，且提供洗衣精和熊寶貝，甚至還有掛燙機，雖然我沒使用到，只是去裝水看到的，但覺得非常方便！
整體來說我會想再來，也會推薦給別人。","The overall is a very good accommodation experience. The equipment is not good at the top, but there are some intimate and convenience brought by some small details everywhere. The integrated space to extend the washing table is the most convenient and favorite point.Although the toilet is small, but the bathroom space is sufficient, and there is enough water pressure hot and cold water at any time. It's also pretty easy to use.I think the reserve provides toothbrushes and toothpaste is very good!Because you have a toothbrush, you can use toothpaste without sealing toothbrushes that are not used.
There is a shading curtain in the window, so that people can completely rest without being affected by the morning sun.
Breakfast is also very sloppy. There are a lot of meals, and there are many things I like to eat. There are Japanese breakfast and now toasts can directly point with chefs.
There are also buffet laundry -baking rooms, and laundry essence and bear baby, and even hanging hot machines. Although I didn't use it, I just saw it to see water, but it was very convenient!
On the whole, I will want to come again, and I will recommend it to others."
早餐炸雞超好吃、地點很讚,"Breakfast fried chicken is super delicious, the location is great"
"用餐環境舒適， 餐點好吃手藝很好 煮食很用心，
沙發好幾個都外觀好好的 坐下去會凹陷 飯店的經營應該要注意物品的損壞更換 免得發生危險意外。
服務真好 我說：想坐角落位 接待員說： 那個位置已有人預訂了 （但是……2個小時過去了……  都沒人出現 一直對每個來客說： 已預約 ）原來可以為客人保留2個小時這種服務讓我大開眼界也， 真的很用心為客 。
＊要注意＊ 店家有限時 2小時用餐  時間一到 就算沒有客人來 有一堆空位，餐廳也會要你離開 喔！ 自己要注意一下用餐時間 。
廁所要走到地下室 只能走樓梯 ，對腳不方便的人可能要考慮一下 ……","The dining environment is comfortable.
Several sofas sit well and sit down. The operation of the restaurant should pay attention to the damage and replacement of the items.
The service is so good. I said: I want to sit in the corner to receive the receptionist and say: Someone has reservations in that position (but ... 2 hours have passed ... no one has always said to everyone: The service of 2 hours made me eye -catching, and I was really attentive.

"要求三樓樹景房，安排301，樹景很舒適，而且低樓層也沒有太多車流聲，浴室在入門右手不算大間但淋浴水壓很足夠，毛巾放在洗手台下(有點低)，還好免治馬桶及整體檯面&角落都非常乾淨。 房內咖啡機是搭配子彈咖啡(歐洲小旅館很常見，懷念～)
－
感謝服務人員協助更換故障的藍牙喇叭。
但桌上檯燈故障無法開…
－
櫃檯人員有一位很親切…其他還真如評價說的很冷淡，但不影響服務的品質…也不要求太多😌","It is required that the tree scenery room on the third floor is required to arrange 301. The tree scenery is very comfortable, and there are not many car sounds on the low floors. Fortunately, the toilet and the overall countertop & corner are very clean.The coffee machine in the room is paired with bullet coffee (small European hotels are very common, nostalgia ~)

Thanks to the service staff for helping to replace the faulty Bluetooth speaker.
But the table lamp on the table cannot be turned on ...

There is one of the counter staff ... others are really cold as the evaluation, but it does not affect the quality of the service ... nor does it require too much 😌 😌 😌 😌 😌 😌 😌 😌 😌 😌"
"房間設備俱全，設計感十足外，動線規畫也很順暢。還有很多置物空間、掛勾等小巧思，住起來便利又舒適。
而且床跟枕頭都是我喜歡的硬度，所以睡得不錯（夜間偶有車流聲，但影響不大）。
這次入住中房，空間比預期更加寬敞，還有俯瞰中山北路林蔭大道的景觀。
乾濕分離浴室有免治馬桶，淋浴間水壓夠空間足。

早餐菜色品該有的品項都有，有蛋料理、現做三明治、日式、美式與清粥小菜區，另有生菜、水果跟飲料吧。
招牌的炸雞超好吃，外酥內嫩又多汁，是意料之外的獨家風味。其他料理口味都偏淡，比較清爽。
當天的水果有西瓜、香瓜跟蘋果，非常清甜又富水份；好吃的優格也挺搶手。","The room equipment is full, the design is full, and the moving line planning is smooth.There are also a lot of ingenuity such as the space, hooking, etc., which are convenient and comfortable to live.
And the bed and the pillow are my favorite hardness, so I slept well (there are occasional cars at night, but the impact is not great).
This time, the space is more spacious than expected, as well as the landscape overlooking the Bulin Avenue of Zhongshan North Road.
The wet and wet separation bathroom has a toilet, and the water pressure in the shower room is enough.

Breakfast dishes have the items that have the items, including egg dishes, now we are made of sandwiches, Japanese, American, and porridge, and there are lettuce, fruits and beverages.
The signature fried chicken is super delicious, crispy, tender and juicy, which is an exclusive flavor outside.Other dishes are light and refreshing.
The fruits of the day include watermelon, melon and apples, which are very sweet and rich in water; the delicious yogurt is also very sought after."

❸ 環保無毒的瑞典編織地板，不知道為什麼就是很喜歡房間內的地板。

❹備品完整且包裝環保：天然沐浴備品，且有提供潤髮乳、身體乳唷！使用紙類包材很環保。

❺交誼廳空間有設計感且空間足夠、電梯有兩台不用等很久！","This time I stayed in the ""big house"", there are too many advantages. The very satisfactory accommodation experience ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I can feel the intimate design from the perspective of ""contemporary users"":

❤️ Practical work table: The room provides independent and spacious long tables+two retro style chairs. Whether it is a working table or a dining table (coffee table), it is satisfactory!

❤️ TV that can extend/conversion direction: You can face the bed when playing in bed. You can turn to the working table during meals. Don't be afraid to eat or stain the sheets on the bed.

❤️ Picking slippers that can be taken away: colorful slippers, travelers may be leather shoes, sneakers, etc., can be more comfortable to put on the pinch slippers, and you can wear it home!(Unlike abandoned slippers, it is not easy to wear and not environmentally friendly)

❤️ Intimate rental service, buffet laundry space: simple and clean laundry room, including dryers, water dispensers, ice making machines. Yoga mats and so on.

✅ Other places you like:

令 The speed of the Internet is satisfactory, and the remote video has not encountered problems; the room provides wireless Bluetooth surrounding audio, you can place the bedside, bathroom, etc. at will, and you can enjoy music.

、 The room is bright, large glass windows, electric curtains, and double -layer curtains are excellent.

瑞 Environmental protection and non -toxic Swedish woven floor, I don't know why I like the floor in the room very much.

且 Complete and packaged and environmentally friendly: Natural bathing spare supplies, and providing moisturizing milk and body milk!It is environmentally friendly using paper bags.

设计 The space of the field has a sense of design and sufficient space. There are two elevators that have not been waited for a long time!"
房間非常乾淨，浴室設有蓮蓬及花灑雙頭淋浴架，軟硬體設備周全，房間內還有美式咖啡機，尤以附加的早餐是自助餐式的，餐點多樣且中西餐都有，CP值高，服務人員貼心親切，交通便利，價格合理，很適合商務出差，下次台北出差，還是要住這。,"The room is very clean. The bathroom has a lotus and a shower double -headed shower rack. The hardware and hardware equipment is fully available. There is also an American coffee machine in the room. The additional breakfast is buffet. High value, intimate service personnel, convenient transportation, reasonable price, very suitable for business trips. Next time Taipei travels, I still have to live here."
"吃個早餐，蒼蠅飛來飛去！
可見環境衛生不佳，需要加強！","Breakfast, flies fly around!
It can be seen that the environmental hygiene is not good and needs to be strengthened!"
地點不錯，房間乾淨整齊，使用台灣品牌薑心比心的備品，另外推薦附近的不二家拉麵，很特別好吃的台式拉麵。,"The location is good, the room is clean and tidy, and the Taiwanese brand Jiang Xinxin's spare supplies are recommended. In addition, the nearby restaurants are recommended, which is very delicious."
"住中房，跟近半年的評論者差不多，我住得很舒適，預先查的負評都沒遇到，寢具好睡、浴室水溫穩定、早餐好吃、室內外噪音都不至於影響睡眠、服務人員中規中矩(再說我不喜歡太熱情的)。

真的要說缺點的話，衛生紙太容易碎掉、沐浴乳不容易起泡、肥皂盒會一直積水，住到後面有點想自己去藥妝店買。

整體來說下次有機會還是會選住這裡。","Living in the middle house, the commentators in the past six months are similar. I have lived very comfortably. I haven't encountered the negative reviews in advance. The personnel are quite satisfactory (let's talk about it too enthusiastic).

If you really want to say the disadvantage, it is easy to break it in toilet paper. It is not easy for bathing milk to make bubbles. The soap box will keep water. If you live, you want to go to the medicine shop to buy it yourself.

Overall, there will be a chance to choose here."
"AMBA品牌一直是極高CP值的酒店，用著少少的預算能享受到國賓體系的服務品質（個人覺得相較於晶華捷絲旅，國賓AMBA在CP值表現上更勝一籌）。

中山AMBA的建築物跟西門町AMBA一樣都偏老，但踏入房間有讓人驚艷到，中山AMBA會覺得房間真的…非常非常的新，不曉得是不是防疫轉一般旅館有經過大整理，整間房間新到讓人有surprise，聯網電視、藍芽音響、免治馬桶這些也是中山獨享的，衛浴使用Hansgrohe、Kohler也是非常超出預期的。

AMBA在服務方面上一直都無需擔心，親切的服務態度，讓人賓至如歸的感覺永遠都是AMBA旅館的強項，此次入住期間借用燙板熨斗，索取額外備品、借用藍芽音響等等的，都能感受到客務、房務的親切。

唯一可惜的是，早餐在美式餐廳雖然餐點食材準備得很用心，但口味上仍輸給西門町一點，但絕對也是超乎商旅水準的品質了。

整體而言給予極度高度的肯定！","The AMBA brand has always been a very high CP -value hotel. With a small budget, the service quality of the national guest system can be enjoyed (I personally feel that compared to Jinghua Jetz, the AMBA AMBA is better in CP value performance).

Zhongshan AMBA's buildings are old -fashioned as AMBA in Ximending, but stepping into the room is amazing. Zhongshan AMBA will feel that the room is really ... very, very new, I don’t know if it is a large -scale organizing in general hotels. The entire room is new to the Surprise. Networked TVs, Bluetooth audio, and toilet -free toilets are also exclusive to Zhongshan. The bathrooms use Hansgrohe and Kohler very much beyond expectations.

AMBA has not needed to worry about services. A kind attitude of service makes people feel that the guests return are always the strengths of the AMBA hotel. During this period of time, I borrowed the iron iron iron, claiming additional equipment, borrowing Bluetooth audio, etc. Can feel the kindness of work and house affairs.

The only pity is that although breakfast is prepared at the American restaurant's meals, it is still lost to Ximending, but it is definitely beyond the quality of business travel.

Overall, give an extremely high affirmation!"
入住809號房，覺得飯店的硬體設備蠻不錯的，房間內有藍芽音箱很棒，備品也蠻好用的，隔天的早餐種類多樣，現炸炸雞好吃，還有現做肉蛋吐司。但服務人員很冷冰冰，尤其是早餐的接待員。,"Checking in Room 809, I think the hotel's hardware equipment is pretty good. The Bluetooth speakers in the room are great, and the preparations are quite easy to use. The breakfast is diverse the next day. Egg toast.But the service staff is very cold, especially the receptionist of breakfast."
"給晚班的櫃檯人員、房務五顆星
但剩下真的無言以對

1. 國賓停車場有入場時間限制、意舍自己的停車場只有一個，午夜後回飯店，完全找不到停車位，詢問櫃檯人員後說可以到運動中心停車，但同樣有入場時間限制，無法入場，在附近繞了一個小時，最後打電話請家人幫忙找附近能夠停的停車場才順利停好車。

2. 某早班看起來較資深的櫃檯人員態度非常差，因家人身體不適無法移動、行程改變，想再多入住幾晚，多少錢都沒關係，但同房型沒有空房間，詢問櫃台人員是否可以加錢早一點入住或晚一點退房，但沒有查房務狀況就告知沒辦法，且口氣、態度極差，後來打給附近的飯店，從五星級、四星級至少都願意查詢當天退房狀況來告知，以後不會想再入住意舍、也不會推薦。","Give five stars in the counter staff in the evening shift
But the rest is really speechless

1. Guobin's parking lot has a restricted time limit, there is only one parking lot for Italian, and after returning to the hotel at midnight, you can't find the parking space at all. , I couldn't enter the venue. After an hour around nearby, I called the family to help the family to find the parking lot nearby to stop the car smoothly.

2. The person in the morning class seems to be relatively poor. The attitude of the counters is very poor. Because the family's physical discomfort cannot be moved, the itinerary changes, and I want to stay in a few nights. It doesn't matter how much money is, but there is no room for the same room type. Add money to stay earlier or later, but not to inform the house without checking the situation of the house, and have a poor breath and attitude. Later, they called nearby restaurants. At least five -star and four -star are willing to query the same day. The situation of the house will be informed that in the future, I will not want to stay in order to give up, and I will not recommend it."
"一泊二食晚餐份量很夠，炸雞很美味
比司吉可以再濕潤一點。
房間中規中矩乾淨 備品使用薑心比心
有提供浴袍，枕頭沒有回彈力，睡起來不舒服。以上供參考☺️","The amount of one dinner for one or two foods is enough, and the fried chicken is delicious
Siji can be more moist.
The room is quite satisfactory to use Jiang Xinxin compared with the heart
There is a bathrobe, the pillow does not return the elasticity, and it is uncomfortable to sleep.The above for reference ️️"
設備新穎，設計簡約實用。電源插座多，充電便利。網路電視會延遲停格，頻寬不足。床墊太晃，容易影響。雙人大房比中房寬敞一點，浴室也多了浴缸可以泡澡，不過配置比較怪，浴缸和淋浴設備不是在同一個空間，反而是和馬桶一起。壽星入住有特別待遇，餐廳炸雞好吃。,"The equipment is novel and the design is simple and practical.There are many power sockets and convenient charging.Internet TV will delay the stopped, and the frequency width will be insufficient.The mattress is too dazzling and easy to affect.The double room is a bit spacious than the Zhongfang, and the bathroom has more bathtubs to take a bath, but the configuration is relatively strange. The bathtub and shower equipment are not in the same space, but together with the toilet.Shouxing is specially treated in staying, and the restaurant fried chicken is delicious."
"入住酷景房，窗外有美麗的樹蔭，早上醒來可以看到綠繡眼在樹上跳來跳去，看著發呆很紓壓:)
也謝謝飯店貼心的生日佈置跟蛋糕，布朗尼非常好吃！覺得有被好好照顧著，很棒的住宿經驗～","Check in the cool view room, there is a beautiful shade outside the window. When you wake up in the morning, you can see the green embroidery eyes jumping around the tree.
Thank you also for your intimate birthday layout and cake. Browni is very delicious!I feel that I have been taken good care of it, a great accommodation experience ~"
昨天跟同學一塊來這裡用餐對於環境，服務人員的服務態度非常滿意，招牌餐點：阿嬤炸雞超級堡更是一級棒好吃！值得推薦給大家喔！,"Yesterday, the service staff's service attitude was very satisfied with the environment with my classmates. The service staff was very satisfied. The signature meal: Grandma fried chicken superborn is even more delicious!It is worth recommending to everyone!"
"有在用心的飯店，附兩個枕頭，床軟硬適中，還有最棒的就是窗簾，電動的。完全簡便又遮光，超級完美的住宿體驗，十二點退房！！

我想給一百萬顆星！！！","Attentive restaurants, two pillows are attached, the beds are soft and hard, and the best is curtains, electric.It is completely simple and shielded, super perfect accommodation experience, check out at 12 o'clock!Intersection

I want to give a million stars!IntersectionIntersection"
"特約停車場有限定停車時間不事先告知，員工自己也不知道。直到凌晨2點要停的時候，去電詢問櫃台人員，櫃台人員再跟停車場確認以後才知道。並且僅口頭說聲不好意思也沒有任何補償，只能自己摸摸鼻子花200多塊的停車費停外面收費停車場。感受極差。
另外，飯店沒遮光窗簾，洗髮乳水水的質地很奇怪，不好用。","The special parking lot has a limited parking time and does not inform them in advance, and the employees do not know themselves.It was not until the time to stop at 2 am, and asked the counter to call the counter. The counter staff did not know after confirming the parking lot.And just verbally, I was embarrassed and had no compensation. I could only touch the parking fee of more than 200 yuan for the parking fee to stop the parking lot.Feeling is extremely poor.
In addition, the restaurant does not have light curtains. The texture of shampoo is strange and not easy to use."
"昨天跟公司去享用自助式晚餐，餐點內容普通，不難吃也沒有很驚艷！菜色也蠻少的～
服務人員的臉色都蠻嚴肅的，想索取小孩泡奶的溫水 ，服務人員直接臉臭～
其實用餐感覺很有壓力（嚴肅的服務人員），價格1300還要額外收服務費，覺得cp值不高！不推薦朋友來。","Yesterday, I went to enjoy the buffet dinner with the company. The content of the meal was ordinary. It was not difficult to eat or amazing!There are also very few dishes ~
The face of the service staff is quite serious. I want to ask for the warm water of the child soaking milk. The service staff directly smells my face ~
The practical meal feels very stressful (serious service personnel). The price of 1300 will also need to receive an additional service fee. I feel that the CP value is not high!Do not recommend friends."
"1. 住的是中房，房間非常乾淨，床和枕頭很好睡

房間清爽簡單乾淨，一樓服務台入住及退房時間人手嚴重不足且臉色超臭，請改進。原本退房前的好心情看到兩張臭臉整個心情超差。,The room is refreshing and clean. The service desk on the first floor and the check -up time are seriously insufficient and the face is super smelly. Please improve.The good mood before checking out saw that the two stinky faces were in a bad mood.
地點很棒，乾淨整潔。離對面辦公大樓偏近窗簾需要長時間關閉。設備普通但也沒有值得詬病之處。,"The location is great, clean and tidy.It takes a long time to close the curtains from the opposite office building.The equipment is ordinary but there is no criticism."
"除夕圍爐用餐,費用昂貴@人/$2,517元. 但用餐座位和自由取餐区,動線規劃不佳非常狹窄,  主食自選小龍蝦+挪威鳕 ,份量不多,  其他自助取餐/品項少,食物普通 , 只有綠色哈密瓜好吃","Dine meals on New Year's Eve, expensive@人/$ 2,517. , Food is ordinary, only green cantaloupe is delicious"
服務人員親切，公共區域也很好,The service staff is kind and the public areas are also very good

"房間很溫馨舒適，格局很好，打掃很乾淨，空間也很大，還可以借用瑜珈墊運動。茶包金萱和烏龍都很好喝。人員親切，服務很好。因為防疫14+1天怕無聊，請家人送電鋼琴到hotel,服務人員很願意且快速的幫忙送到房間門口。每天餐點也非常豐富，份量大，選擇多，蔬菜也多樣，份量也很多，最喜歡菲力牛排和Carrot cake. 下次有機會，還是會選擇中山意舍。","The room is very warm and comfortable, the pattern is very good, the cleaning is clean, the space is also very large, and you can borrow yoga mat.Both the tea bag Jin Xuan and oolong are delicious.The staff is kind and the service is very good.Because the epidemic prevention is boring for 14+1 day, ask the family to send the piano to the hotel, and the service staff is willing and quickly help to send it to the door of the room.The daily meals are also very rich, the portion is large, the choice is large, the vegetables are diverse, and the portion is also a lot.

這間酒店房間不大，但是該有的設備都蠻齊全的，很推他們的早餐超豐富不吃都很難，外國人士很多所以他們的早餐就很多元,"This hotel room is not large, but the equipment should be quite complete. It is difficult to push their breakfast and not eat it. There are many foreigners, so they have a lot of breakfast."
"10月底去參加GQ城市野營時，在你們的攤位點了一份炸雞，印象中大概250，然後想說逛一逛再回來拿應該差不多，大概過了半小回來後，還是沒炸好，店員跟我們說好像機器有點問題，還要再等一陣子，又過了十五分，店員因為我們等很久送了我們一份小卷，這部分蠻感謝的，後來大概又過了20分，終於好了，但是炸雞吃起來很奇怪，炸雞本體跟裹上的粉體是分開的，加上沙拉醬，吃起來味道真的蠻詭異，有點好像沒有全熟的感覺，吃不到三分之一，我們一致決定還是放棄這份炸雞吧，回家果真腸胃很不舒服😂
其實我覺得如果產品本身真的有問題，可以好好的告知我們，退費或是換其他食物都沒關係，雖然等了很久，但總比吃完那些不熟的炸雞，肚子痛好。原本對你們的餐點印象蠻好的，所以就算貴了一點，也覺得沒關係，希望你們可以不要再發生這種問題了，食安真的蠻重要的。","When I went to the GQ city camping at the end of October, I ordered a fried chicken at your booth, which was about 250 in the impression. The clerk told us that there was a problem with the machine, and we had to wait a while, and fifteen points passed. Because we waited for a long time, we sent us a small volume. This part is quite grateful. Later, it probably over 20 points. Finally, but the fried chicken tastes strange. The fried chicken body is separated from the wrapped powder. With the salad sauce, the taste is really weird. It seems a bit familiar. In one, we unanimously decided to give up this fried chicken, and go home to the fact that the stomach is very uncomfortable 😂
In fact, if there is a problem with the product itself, I can tell us that the refund or other foods does not matter. Although it has been waited for a long time, it is always better than those unfamiliar fried chicken.Originally, I was very impressed with your meals, so even if it is more expensive, it doesn't matter. I hope you can not have such a problem. It is really important for food safety."
"房間的床褥比較硬
沐浴設施不錯
只是電視遙控都鋪了塵，這個位置衛生有進步空間。","The mattresses in the room are relatively hard
Bathing facilities are good
It's just that the remote control of TV has been spread out, and there is room for progress in this position."
"捷運中山站4號（有電扶梯）出來步行約8分鐘。

"尷尬的萬聖節
提前一星期要為小朋友過萬聖節
因為擔心31號人太多 所以訂了24號 也提前以粉絲上詢問了有無佈置 因為不放心又打了電話確認佈置
當天到了 完全沒有 才被告知因為前一天有婚禮（關我何事！）我非常氣憤 問為何沒告知 帶位人員還回我沒接確認電話 我直接回他你會再確認電話裡告知我佈置已拆嗎？他才安靜 接下來是穿西裝的 又想反駁說粉絲團訊息有告知 我直接打臉他把訊息給他看 也沒有告知 最後他們趕緊稍微簡單佈置一些 然後桌上再放一些 但其實一進門的驚喜已經沒了 小朋友走時還問我 我的Halloween  呢？ 我都快哭了 真的花了6千多元 我只吃到我該吃的食物 其他什麼都沒有 2個星是給好吃的炸雞 這樣的服務 跟事後處理 讓我很懷疑這是飯店水準嗎？這當天只有我們一組聖誕餐 只要再細心一點 提前只在我們身後跟桌上先佈置好我也會覺得感動 而不是進門空空如也 以後以要花同樣的錢不會再光臨了","Embarrassing Halloween
Turn over Halloween for children one week in advance
I was worried that there were too many people on the 31st, so I booked on the 24th and asked the fans in advance whether the arrangement was arranged because I was unhappy and called to confirm the arrangement.
When I was on the same day, I was not told because there was a wedding the day before (what about me!) I was very angry and asked why I did n’t tell the person who returned to confirm that I would go back to him. I will confirm that the arrangement has been dismantled on the phone. Is it?He was quietly wearing a suit and wanted to refute that the message of the fan group told me that he directly faced the message. He showed him the message and did not tell him that in the end they hurriedly arranged some of them. When I was gone, I asked me my Halloween when I left?I'm almost crying. I really spent more than 6,000 yuan. I only eat the food I should eat. There are no two stars. There are no 2 stars for the services of delicious fried chicken. Is it?On the day, only our group of Christmas meals only need to be carefully arranged behind us and the table."
"房間乾淨，地點佳
衛浴設備很讚讚～可以馬上洗到熱水澡不用等水熱實在優🤣","The room is clean and the location is good
The bathroom equipment is very praised ~ You can take a hot bath immediately without waiting for water heat."
入住一晚覺得房間很舒適，洗手台在進門的地方很方便，早餐吧費也蠻多元還不錯吃，除了地點距離捷運站有點距離外，其他都還不錯,"I feel that the room is very comfortable for one night. The washing table is very convenient to enter the door. The breakfast bar fee is quite diverse and good. Except for the location from the MRT station, everything else is not bad."

"🏨空間適中，採光好
✔️房間乾淨舒適，床鋪很好睡，窗簾遮光度高，淺眠的旅客不怕被太陽叫醒。
✔️隔音不錯，半夜沒聽到其他房間吵雜聲
✔️櫃檯服務人員都非常親切，從早班到大夜都很優秀👍🏻
✔️走路兩分鐘就有超商，很方便
🔺習慣搭捷運到旅客需要稍微走久一些些
🔺大門口不明顯，一樓隔壁連接美式餐廳，沒有仔細看的話容易錯過大廳入口。","光 Moderate space and good lighting
舒️ The room is clean and comfortable, the beds are very good to sleep, the curtains are high, and the sleeping passengers are not afraid of being woken up by the sun.
，️ Good sound insulation, I don’t hear other room noisy in the middle of the night
都 ️ The counter service staff are very kind, from the morning class to the big night.
就️ There are supermarkets for two minutes, which is very convenient
运If items need to take the MRT to passengers, you need to go a little longer
The gate is not obvious. The next floor is connected to American restaurants."
"早上風景很好 但另一個角度如果都是樹的話會更佳 這個是酷型房型 有音響等等很多東西
還有免費夾腳拖😂 …","The scenery in the morning is very good, but if the other angle is a tree, it will be better. This is a cool room type, there are many things, etc.
There is also a free to pinch ..."
"雖然很美，但其實不好用啊…例如桌子上的燈被固定住，不能調整。凳子可愛，但是不好放東西。夾腳拖有特色，但是難穿。浴缸跟馬桶在同一區，洗完澡用馬桶，會容易踩到地上的水。玻璃門可以移動，但只有一片，滑動後，原本的地方就沒有遮擋了。熱水壺、吧台也被整合到浴室。但是外面空間也還蠻空的。電視很大，可是訊號不穩定，畫質不佳。書桌正對門口。
服務人員相對沒那麼親切跟主動。大廳沒有等候空間和座椅。
整體而言，有點莫名其妙的設計。","Although it is beautiful, it is not easy to use ... For example, the lights on the table are fixed and cannot be adjusted.The stool is cute, but it is not easy to put things.The pinch is dragged, but it is difficult to wear.The bathtub and the toilet are in the same area. After taking a bath, the toilet will easily step on the water on the ground.The glass door can be moved, but there is only one piece. After sliding, the original place is not covered.The hot kettle and bar are also integrated into the bathroom.But the outside space is also pretty empty.TV is very large, but the signal is unstable and the picture quality is not good.The desk is facing the door.
The service staff is not so kind and proactive.There is no waiting space and seat in the lobby.
Overall, a bit inexplicable design."
服務很好，早餐選項還蠻多的，吃了2天幾乎早餐一樣，床很舒服😊 …,"The service is very good, there are quite a lot of breakfast options. After eating for 2 days, almost the same breakfast, the bed is very comfortable ..."
沒想到這不貴的價格房間還蠻舒服的，這次選的是corner room （當日房價$2900含早餐）有兩邊窗戶 雖然是下雨天但開揚的感覺還是很棒 早餐是在樓下butter milk吃breakfast buffet 食物選擇不多,"I did not expect that the price of the room was quite comfortable. This time, the CORNER Room (house price $ 2900 with breakfast on the day) has two windows on both sides. Breakfast buffet not many foods"
跟西門町和松山意舍比起來整體都有差一些 大廳 房間等 但乾淨度和早餐一樣好,"Compared with Ximending and Songshan Yishe as a whole, there are worse lobby rooms."
"空間很大很舒適的環境，地理位置很優異
除了床太軟睡得不太習慣
其他沒有可挑惕的！","The environment is very comfortable and comfortable, and the geographical location is excellent
I am not used to sleeping except that the bed is too soft
There are no other things to be vigilant!"
"此次預約兩間房。
一住是陽台房二單床的書桌椅太佔位置，踢了3回,腳指甲差點離家出走，所以被扣一顆星。
二酷景房給5顆星，推。","Book the two rooms this time.
The desk chair of the two -bedroom bed in the balcony room was too position. I kicked 3 times.
Give 5 stars in the two cool scenery rooms."
電視新又大，用品 嚴選枕頭跟床單的感覺真好， 也喜歡他們的小牙刷 牙膏比一般商務旅店 方便 我覺得很用心,"The TV is new and big, and the supplies are so good that the pillow and the sheets are really good. I also like their small toothbrushes toothpaste than ordinary business hotels. I feel very attentive."
"今天團訂，

櫃檯比較沒笑容，不過整體來說服務還是沒問題。早餐算好吃，房間設計還有View都非常棒！值得再來,"The counter is relatively small, but the service is still fine overall.Breakfast is delicious, the room design and view are great!Worth coming again"
住起來感覺很好,I feel very good to live
"同事隔離結束，開車去接停在飯店後面的停車場，跟我說後面是防疫通道沒辦法把車暫停這邊，要停在飯店門口才可以。
我說飯店門口是紅線，我被檢舉怎麼辦？
得到的答覆是：那就付錢啊⋯沒有啦我們會幫你注意。
結果一個人都沒來幫忙看⋯
好幾個車位不提供給房客接人且鼓勵違規停車的優質飯店：）","The colleagues were in isolation, and the parking lots behind the hotel were driven. Tell me that there was no way to stop the car from the epidemic prevention passage.
I said that the restaurant's door was a red line. What should I do if I was reported?
The answer you get is: then pay for it, we will help you pay attention.
As a result, no one came to help watch it ...
Several high -quality hotels that are not provided to tenants to pick up people and encourage illegal parking :)"
"因地點方便選定中山意舍，第一次來此，兩大一小居住兩晚，住大床房型。酒店有準備小帳篷和玩具，讓孩子一入住就很開心。有提供一些桌遊和生活便利物品可租借。超棒的。
早餐很豐盛，還有花茶（這很少見）很舒服😌
這次入住覺得很讚。大力推薦喔！ …","Because of the convenience of the location, Zhongshan Yishe. For the first time, the two big and small lives lived for two nights and lived in a large bed room.The hotel has a small tent and toy, so that the child is very happy as soon as you check in.There are some board games and convenience items for living.Superb.
Breakfast is rich, and there are flower tea (this is rare) very comfortable 😌
I felt great this time.Recommend strong!Mowing"
位置頗方便，距離捷運中山站只幾分鐘步程。房間簡約整潔，接待員態度有禮。只是早餐食物選擇不多，我們住五晚，吃得有點膩了。,"The location is quite convenient, only a few minutes from the MRT Zhongshan Station.The room is simple and tidy, and the receptionist attitude is polite.It's just that there are not many breakfast foods. We live for five nights and eat a little tired."
"服務是很好，食材也很不錯，空間也很愜意，如果以食物的品質來說，這是一個值得推薦的餐廳。
不過，可能是我對世界美食的認識非常不足，我拿到菜單後，有八成的菜色是我看不懂，也沒辦法憑空想像的，直到他做好端上來我才明白我究竟點了什麼。主觀來說，本餐館的菜也不太合我的胃口。
如果是在臺灣生活的人，想要品嚐平日少接觸的西式餐點，又希望有不錯的食材的倒是值得一試。","The service is very good, the ingredients are also very good, and the space is very comfortable. If the quality of food is concerned, this is a recommended restaurant.
However, it may be that my understanding of the world's food is very insufficient. After I got the menu, 80 % of the dishes I did not understand, and I couldn't imagine it out of thin air. I did not understand what I ordered what I ordered. EssenceSubjectively speaking, the food in this restaurant is not very good at my appetite.
If you are a person living in Taiwan, you want to taste the western -style meals that you have less contact with each other, and you hope that there are good ingredients. It is worth trying."
餐廳的料理非常特別，用餐的時候聽說2017/05/04後會換菜單。To share兩人份+單點麵包和一道菜，三個人吃還是很飽，很喜歡無花果的系列，好吃！會忍不住想嘗試每到菜。,"The restaurant's cuisine is very special. I heard that the menu will be changed after 2017/05/04.TO Share two people+single -point bread and a dish. The three people are still very full. I like the series of figs, delicious!I can't help but want to try every dish."
"置身在中山北路卻非常cozy的飯店
也可以看到窗外的街景
不過晚上車經過的聲音還是蠻大聲就是了
但還是蠻值得來住看看","The restaurant is located on Zhongshan North Road but very cozy
You can also see the street view outside the window
But the sound of the car passed at night is still quite loud
But it's still worth watching"
"這一波飯店外帶便當/餐盒中 是少數有誠意 且做的不錯的: 預訂15分鐘就可提領, 價格合理, 炸雞不錯吃","This wave of restaurants with bento/lunch box is one of the few sincere and good to make: reservation for 15 minutes can be considered, the price is reasonable, fried chicken is good to eat"
滿意，房間乾淨利落，早餐10分豐盛，服務人員熱誠及專業，周遭景點相當多，機動性相當良好，交通便利，值得來住,"Satisfaction, the room is clean and neat, the breakfast is 10 points, the service staff is enthusiastic and professional, there are quite a lot of scenic spots, the mobility is quite good, the transportation is convenient, it is worth living"
很有質感的旅館，使用的沐浴用品是將薑心比心，隔音很好，床好睡，早餐好吃又豐富，鄰近中山捷運站,"A very textured hotel, the bath supplies used to compare Jiang's heart, sound sound insulation, sleep well, breakfast is delicious and rich, adjacent to Zhongshan MRT Station"

"開在台北amab中山意舍酒店一樓，空間明亮雅緻，適合跟朋友相約聚會。

初訪是下午茶時段，set menu 一套 $480 另加服務費，包含迷你鹹點盤、甜點盤、一份飲料。餐點份量非常非常少，甜鹹點都是 finger food 的大小，兩口就吃完，且冰淇淋上桌時已經半融化、起司蛋糕也表現平平。整體來說下午茶CP值偏低，口味普通也不太有記憶度，吃完覺得空虛，這個價位有很多更好的選擇。

午晚餐價位也偏高，想來這裡吃一頓好的，得多準備點預算！","Open on the first floor of the AMAB Zhongshan Yishe Hotel in Taipei. The space is bright and elegant, suitable for meeting with friends.

The first visit is the afternoon tea period. The Set Menu has a $ 480 and added a service fee, including a mini salty disk, dessert disk, and a drink.The meal is very small, and the sweet and salty dots are the size of Finger Food. The two are eaten, and the ice cream has melted half when the ice cream is on the table, and the cheese cake is also flat.On the whole, the CP value of the afternoon tea is low, and the taste is not very memorable. After eating, it feels empty. There are many better choices at this price.

The price of noon dinner is also high. I want to come here to eat a good meal, so prepare some budget!"
中午用餐時太陽灑落進餐廳的感覺很美好，裝潢簡約舒適，餐點簡單且原創，風味的組合也相當有趣，以餐點的品質來看這樣的價位相當划算，也有許多的單杯葡萄酒可做搭餐選擇。,"It feels beautiful when the sun falls into the restaurant at noon meals, the decoration is simple and comfortable, the meal is simple and original, and the combination of flavor is quite interesting. From the quality of the meal, this price is quite cost -effective. There are also many single cups of wine to make it. Selection of meals."
連一顆星都不想給   要停電為何不電話通知顧客   非得要用booking傳訊息  有時候就不會跳通知    到了時候才說要停電   難道要賠償沒吹冷氣的費用嗎 半夜熱的要命,"Even a star does not want to give a power outage, why not call the customer not to notify the customer if you have to use a book message Sometimes you will not jump not to notify it when you have to stop the power."
離開台北後回來必須住酒店了，地點不錯的中山意舍，入住時大雨有遺憾，乾乾淨淨也舒適的睡眠環境，奈何認床了睡不著，早起吃早餐，環境很好，餐點不多口味上都不錯，阿嬤的炸雞也出現在餐台上，酥酥脆脆很好吃，單點早餐和像500多，入住免費挺超值,"After leaving Taipei, you must stay in the hotel. Zhongshan Yishe, where the location is good, has regrets when it is in the rain, clean and comfortable sleeping environment. The taste is good. Grandma's fried chicken also appears on the dining table. The crispy and crispy is delicious. Single breakfast and more than 500 like you are free of charge."

參加喜宴的關係前一晚和老婆投宿在這邊，飯店整齊乾淨不用懷疑，但是隔音效果真的非常差，我住在五樓靠近馬路的房間，也太誇張了吧，隔音異常差，外面的機車汽車喇叭聲音引擎聲音，非常明顯，連隔壁在笑都聽得到，老婆淺眠的人幾乎整晚沒什麼睡，連床也非常扯，稍微動一下整個床都在晃，怕吵醒老婆整個晚上同一個姿勢睡覺隔天還有點落枕，晚上要洗澡時候還發現沒有沐浴乳跟洗髮乳，打電話到櫃檯問是否有提供，櫃檯回答說有，我跟他說完全沒有，還叫我到浴室看看有沒有放在架子上，讓我很不爽，感覺不相信客人一樣，再說你叫我去浴室看看，不就自打嘴巴沒有整理確實補齊嗎？你們放在洗手台旁邊有牙刷牙膏和護膚乳那些都擺放很整齊，就唯獨沒有沐浴乳和洗髮乳，很明顯就是忘記擺上去，結果送來的服務生，一聲不好意思都沒講，電話那邊的聲音和服務生的表情讓我感覺就是懷疑我們凹你們的東西，再打電話到櫃檯要新的，我跟老婆愛旅遊，住過的飯店和汽車旅館n百間了，經驗告訴我說就是你們的疏失阿，一間要價接近四千的房型，人文，硬體各方面卻是這種品質，台中隨便一間汽車旅館都屌打你們，你們的隔音真的讓人感到可怕，太瞎了,"The night before participating in the wedding banquet, I stayed here with my wife. The restaurant was neat and clean, and there was no doubt, but the sound insulation effect was really bad. I lived in the room near the road on the fifth floor, which was too exaggerated. The sound engine sound of the motorcycle horn engine is very obvious. Even the laughing next door can be heard. The wife's sleeping person almost sleeps almost all night, and even the bed is very teased. Sleeping in the same posture, I still had a pillow the next day. When I was bathing at night, I found that there were no bath milk and shampoo. I called the counter to ask if there was any provision. See if I put it on the shelf, it makes me very unhappy, and I feel like I do n’t believe in the guests. Besides, you ask me to go to the bathroom to see, do you really make up for it?You put toothbrushes toothpaste and skin care creams next to the sink, and they are very neatly placed, but there is no bath milk and shampoo. Obviously, I forgot to put it up. , The voice and the expression of the waiter made me feel like we doubt our stuff, and then call the counter to be new. I love to travel with my wife. Tell me that it is your negligence. A room type with a asking price is close to 4,000, but the humanities, and the hardware are all this quality. A merchant in Taichung hit you. Your sound insulation is really terrible , Too blind"
"家族早餐會。
魯肉飯很香，米也Q，調味方面稍微偏鹹。
稀飯為增加濃稠，有稍微勾芡較無法吃到米香。

水菓在蘋果及香蕉，新鮮度耀再加強。
整體來說還不錯，可以推薦。","家族早餐會。

"一樓Buttermilk美式餐廳
乾淨舒適，一樓挑高視野極佳，沒多餘腦殘的隔間或擺飾，除非客人沒克制聊天的音量，否則蠻適合聚餐或發呆品下午茶。

餐點精緻，量少。
除非菜單上，清清楚楚標示牛排是幾oz，否則你大可不必怕所點的餐點過量，基本上，都是輕量級的擺盤。

烤酪梨奶油萵苣沙拉，建議你試試。
BLT漢堡，超乎預期的好吃，牛肉多汁輕軟，入口可嚐到多層次的香氣，單點450，值這價。

咖啡普普！","Buttermilk American restaurant on the first floor
Clean and comfortable, the first floor is very high, and there is no excess brain disabled compartment or decoration. Unless the guest does not restrain the volume of chat, it is quite suitable for dinner or dazzling afternoon tea.

The meals are exquisite and small.
Unless the menu is clearly marked with a few OZs, you don't have to be afraid of excessive meals, basically lightweight plates.

Creamy lettuce with osmotic cream, it is recommended to try it.
BLT Burger is beyond expected delicious. The beef is juicy and soft. You can taste a multi -level aroma at the entrance.

Coffee Pup!"
"此酒店一樓餐聽鬧中取靜,相當適合洽談公事或品下午茶和聚餐.惟位於老爺酒店與國賓飯店附近精華地帶,偏高之物價,難免對一般上班族或年輕族群具有較重的荷包負擔.",The meal on the first floor of this hotel is quite suitable for discussing business or afternoon tea and dinner meals.

台北突然間流行起這種解構風格的料理餐廳，從RAW、MUME到今天要介紹的ACHOI都是同一類型。每個視角都好棒，尤其是靠窗得這一側，既有空間通透感又能看到外面街景。帶一點鹹香的薄餅，底下是打發過的花生醬，花生醬質地清盈滑順，入口有花生香甜但又比花生醬順口，非常涮嘴。胡蘿蔔味噌湯、萊姆油(午間套餐)，友人說沒有胡蘿蔔的味道，而且出奇順口好喝，胡蘿蔔與味噌揉合後味道相當和諧，是讓他相當喜愛的一道湯品。炙燒蘿蔓沙拉、番石榴、格律耶爾起士、香檳油醋(午間套餐)，有點讓人不知道該從何開始下手的一道沙拉，沒有特別好吃但是裡面藏著的番石榴塊增添了不少趣味與驚喜。透抽燉飯、酥脆蓮藕片、帕馬森起士、檸檬、巴西利(午間套餐)，意料之內的味道，但蓮藕脆片像小點一般，很討人喜愛，整體份量並不多，如果沒有加點其他的東西，午間套餐應該就是吃個恰好的七酥炸軟殼蟹、柚子胡椒醬、七種香料。覺得這是最一般的菜色，有點油膩然後就是一般的軟殼蟹，柚子胡椒醬的柚子和胡椒都不突出。,台北突然間流行起這種解構風格的料理餐廳，從RAW、MUME到今天要介紹的ACHOI都是同一類型。每個視角都好棒，尤其是靠窗得這一側，既有空間通透感又能看到外面街景。帶一點鹹香的薄餅，底下是打發過的花生醬，花生醬質地清盈滑順，入口有花生香甜但又比花生醬順口，非常涮嘴。胡蘿蔔味噌湯、萊姆油(午間套餐)，友人說沒有胡蘿蔔的味道，而且出奇順口好喝，胡蘿蔔與味噌揉合後味道相當和諧，是讓他相當喜愛的一道湯品。炙燒蘿蔓沙拉、番石榴、格律耶爾起士、香檳油醋(午間套餐)，有點讓人不知道該從何開始下手的一道沙拉，沒有特別好吃但是裡面藏著的番石榴塊增添了不少趣味與驚喜。透抽燉飯、酥脆蓮藕片、帕馬森起士、檸檬、巴西利(午間套餐)，意料之內的味道，但蓮藕脆片像小點一般，很討人喜愛，整體份量並不多，如果沒有加點其他的東西，午間套餐應該就是吃個恰好的七酥炸軟殼蟹、柚子胡椒醬、七種香料。覺得這是最一般的菜色，有點油膩然後就是一般的軟殼蟹，柚子胡椒醬的柚子和胡椒都不突出。
離捷運站走路約10分鐘。飯店提供免費洗衣及烘衣，非常方便。就近有無老火鍋，宜蘭小吃店，想就近享用美食又不想傷腦筋，是不錯的選擇。,離捷運站走路約10分鐘。飯店提供免費洗衣及烘衣，非常方便。就近有無老火鍋，宜蘭小吃店，想就近享用美食又不想傷腦筋，是不錯的選擇。
房間乾淨，早餐選擇不多但是蠻好吃的,"The room is clean, the breakfast chooses not many but it is delicious"
環境很不錯，有夜景，裝潢氣氛也很舒服。餐點有點普通，服務生的服務不夠細心有待加強。,環境很不錯，有夜景，裝潢氣氛也很舒服。餐點有點普通，服務生的服務不夠細心有待加強。
食材不錯、但不可太多人開車去、每桌只能停一台車（3000元2小時）。義大利麵不太像像油麵。,"The ingredients are good, but not too many people can drive, and each table can only stop one car (3,000 yuan 2 hours).The pasta does not look like oil noodles."
浴室嚴重積水，枕頭或棉被有塵蟎（因為我對塵蟎過敏）,"The bathroom is severely accumulated, and there are dust mites in the pillow or quilt (because I am allergic to dust mites)"
在中山區，交通很方便，設計很特別，下面有銀行，可以換錢，旁邊小巷有特色台灣小菜，按摩附近有間”足道”，不過不便宜，中山捷運站附近有三越，三越附近有檔”洪小姐車庫滷味”，很不錯。,"In Zhongshan District, the transportation is very convenient and the design is very special. There are banks below, you can change money, there are special Taiwanese dishes next to the alley, there are ""footsteps"" near the massage, but it is not cheap. The file ""Miss Hong Garage"" is very good."
餐點好吃，服務很棒,The meal is delicious and the service is great
在這裡辦公司活動，兩面採光環境舒適，點心也好吃！比在大飯店辦手續簡便彈性高,"The office activities here, the lighting environment on both sides is comfortable, and the snacks are delicious!Simple and elastic than the procedures for doing the procedures in the big hotel"
工作人員服務好。房間舒適及整潔。早餐很營養及豐富,The staff service is good.The room is comfortable and tidy.Breakfast is very nutritious and rich
房間便宜乾淨整潔(還附早餐)，夜晚街道車聲有些微影響，但整體性還是很棒的體驗。,"The room is cheap, clean and tidy (also attached to breakfast). The sound of the streets at night slightly affects the sound of the streets, but the overall experience is still a great experience."
房間乾淨夠寬敞，服務人員親切，B1的酒吧很值得去,"The room is clean and spacious, the service staff is kind, and the B1 bar’s bar is worth going"
8/23返台入住，展開兩週的防疫隔離。原本躭心日子很難熬，這個疑慮在櫃檯人員親切的服務，以及豐富多變的三餐菜色下，很快消融怠盡。下次如果有需要，還是會選擇Amba！,"Back to Taiwan at 8/23, starting for two weeks of epidemic prevention isolation.It was very difficult to have a heart. This doubt was quickly well -fidized under the cordial service of the counter staff and the rich and varied three meals.If you need it next time, you will still choose AMBA!"
"餐點價錢較高且份量不多
炸雞很好吃且飲料可以無線續杯，是一個聊天哈啦的好地方

可惜沒有圓桌，如果人多的時候距離拉的太開了
講話會很累的","The price of meals is high and the portion is not much
The fried chicken is delicious and the beverage can be a wireless renewal. It is a good place to chat.

Unfortunately, there is no round table, if there are many people, the distance is too open.

"這次稱端午節連假加上疫情驅緩來到台北中山意舍酒店,可從中山火車站從CityLink大樓3F的空橋到達
地理位置相當不錯,捷運火車2鐡共構非常方便
從酒店走路約5~10分可到達饒河夜市,機能不錯,這個地方不比信義/大安區那麼多人,但饒河夜市可說是非常熱鬧

從CityLink大樓3F的空橋到達AMBA大樓3F,直達到意舍酒店17樓(大廳),他的電梯也非常特別,有類似小磁磚拼湊的,相當細心

到了大廳就有一大片的落地景觀,可以看到180度的大台北地區跟101大樓,W HOTEL飯店,還有微風南山等等的高樓

酒店的感覺非常有設計感,有好幾張沙發可坐,以及有看到足球枱,應該可以去借球來玩,但這次去沒看到有人在玩
還有看到一個桌球桌,但沒有網子,也許也能借來玩

在櫃台也有擺放一些商品,包括房間內的東西

CHECK-in完成後便直達到這次所住的18F,「101中房」這次因為搭了「麥當勞扺用券」可扺2000元,相當不錯

找房間時,發現每間房間的門牌設計都不一樣,非常有趣,大家如果有去住的話,可以去看看,別具一格

進到房間,打開窗簾,大開眼戒,房間的景非常好,可以注視整個101,甚至可以用手機來錄縮時攝影,相當精采,一邊在房間喝著咖啡,一邊欣賞101,非常享受

After Check-in is completed, it will reach the 18F that I live in this time. ""101 House"" this time is 2,000 yuan because of the ""McDonald's Coupon"", which is quite good.

進門時空調20度，很冷。其他都很舒適。 |找不到藍牙喇叭說明書，只好到網上查。 |請問有搭配咖啡機的膠囊嗎？,"When entering the door, the air conditioner is 20 degrees, which is very cold.Others are comfortable.| I can't find the Bluetooth speaker instructions, so I have to check it online.| Is there a capsule with a coffee machine?"
早餐食完不會補充。選擇不多。果汁不是正常味道，感覺不是現制。所有食物感覺都是造了很久的。人手不夠。升降機時常有蚊子。住了一個星期。早餐都是一樣，沒有變化。洗手臺不在浴室的。 |入住和退房都很快速。清潔有改善空間。位置還好。比較新飯店，有提供免費的拖鞋和水。,"Breakfast will not be added.There are not many choices.The juice is not a normal taste, it feels not the current system.All food feels for a long time.People are not enough.There are often mosquitoes in lifts.Live for a week.Breakfast is the same and there is no change.The washing table was not in the bathroom.| Check and check out quickly.Cleaning has room for improvement.The position is fine.Compared with new hotels, there are free slippers and water."
位於台北市中心的好飯店。搭乘地鐵和公車路線可輕鬆前往多個景點。房間整潔乾淨。熱情好客是一流的。早餐菜單還可以，但仍然可以改進，尤其是在變化上。,"Good restaurant located in the center of Taipei.Take the subway and bus routes to multiple attractions.The room is neat and clean.Passionate hospitality is first -rate.The breakfast menu is okay, but it can still be improved, especially in changing."
該位置靠近地鐵，可透過連接橋到達。對面有一個購物中心，那裡有餐廳、優衣庫和其他商店。房間很乾淨，有浴缸（孩子們最喜歡，因為他們可以做浴缸炸彈），我們個人很喜歡超級大床。他們的招牌拖鞋太棒了！我穿著它們逛夜市。謝謝你，安巴！當我們訪問台灣時，我們會回來的！ 😉,"This location is close to the subway and can be reached through the connection bridge.There is a shopping center opposite, where there are restaurants, Uniqlo and other stores.The room is very clean and has a bathtub (children like the most, because they can do bathtub bombs), and we personally like super big beds.Their signature slippers are great!I wore them to visit the night market.Thank you, Anba!When we visit Taiwan, we will come back!Bleak"
4/23-4/25北部出差選擇中山意舍為兩個晚上的休息飯店。 ||位於台北市中山區距離捷運站距離很近，方便前往各個地點，有遇到下雨天有提供雨傘服務非常貼心，早餐提供簡易的自助式餐點，簡單而美味。 ||兩天的住宿房間整潔乾淨衛生，設計感也不錯，浴室水溫跟水量適中，沐浴用品也非常特別的薑系列感覺很獨特，床跟枕頭睡起來也很舒服又安靜。兩天住宿體驗中特別感謝Alex接待與熱情款待，整體而言感受非常好👍是值得再次住宿的飯店 …,"4/23-4/25 Northern traverser selected Zhongshan Yishe as a rest restaurant for two nights.|| It is located in Zhongshan District, Taipei City.

The water temperature and water in the bathroom are moderate. The ginger series with very special bath products feel unique. The bed and pillow are also very comfortable and quiet.Thank you in the two -day accommodation experience. Thank you Alex for reception and enthusiastic treatment. Overall, I feel very good."
飯的整體營運模式讓體驗非常舒適，營運經理Alex接待服務熱誠，對問題及意見回饋非常迅速用心。床和枕頭超好睡！ |早餐採用自助式的buffet ，餐點內容豐富多樣，其中很特別的是有提供“炸雞🍗”，卡拉外皮口感酥脆，肉質鮮美多汁。提供客製單點的蛋料多樣化，廚師🧑‍🍳手藝很棒！ |非常推薦一定要享用早餐🍳 …,"The overall operating model of the rice makes the experience very comfortable.

Carah the skin is crispy and the meat is delicious.Provides a diverse egg -making egg, and the chef is great in craftsmanship!| It is recommended to enjoy breakfast 🍳 ..."
我們住了 3 晚。我們要求提前入住並付費，從海外抵達後早上 9 點就可以進入我們的房間。服務和前台非常樂於滿足我們的需求。房間乾淨、現代，床/床單很舒適。每日清潔服務非常出色。可以使用洗衣房非常方便。靠近幾個地鐵站。,"We lived for 3 nights.We ask for staying in and paid in advance, and we can enter our room at 9 o'clock in the morning after arriving overseas.Services and front desks are very happy to meet our needs.The room is clean and modern, and the bed/sheets are very comfortable.The daily cleaning service is excellent.It is very convenient to use the washing room.Close to several subway stations."
這家旅館是我們“旅行中發現的”，有舒適的床、足夠大的房間、漂亮的盥洗用品。當我們騎自行車旅行時，我們必須組裝和拆卸自行車，所以每層樓的公共座位/閱讀空間都派上用場。自助洗衣是另一個頂級功能。較高樓層的房間很安靜，但我們在二樓還有一個更大的房間，幾乎一樣安靜。最重要的是，在 2024 年 4 月最近發生的地震期間，我們在這家飯店感到安全。,"This hotel is ""discovered during travel"", with comfortable beds, large enough rooms, beautiful cleansing supplies.When we are riding a bicycle, we must assemble and disassemble the bicycle, so the public seat/reading space on each floor is in handy.Buffet laundry is another top function.The rooms on the higher floors are quiet, but we also have a larger room on the second floor, almost as quiet.The most important thing is that during the recent earthquake in April 2024, we felt safe at this restaurant."
地點和服務都很好，房間也很乾淨。不過，窗戶是半透明的，所以看不到外面的景色。另外，房間的面積有點小。然而，整體來說還是很棒的。,"The location and service are very good, and the room is very clean.However, the windows are translucent, so you can't see the scenery outside.In addition, the area of ​​the room is a bit small.However, it is still great overall."
工作人員非常樂於助人且周到。我在旅行的最後一天生病了，所以我改簽了航班，並打電話給前台要求延長住宿一晚。雖然無法提供同一個房間，但男前台工作人員很快就為我提供了對面的房間，並安排了另一名工作人員幫我搬行李到新房間。這看似微不足道，但對患者來說卻意義重大。我衷心感謝您的安排。,"The staff is very happy and thoughtful.I was sick on the last day of the trip, so I changed the flight and called the front desk for extended accommodation for one night.Although it was impossible to provide the same room, the front desk staff of the male front desk quickly provided me with the opposite room, and arranged another staff member to help me move my luggage to the new room.This seems trivial, but it is of great significance to patients.I sincerely thank you for your arrangement."
它很舒適並且具有易於使用的佈局。 |洗手盆很大，使用方便。 |淋浴也很好用。 |毛巾浴巾每次都換|前台的人很友善，很開心。 |飯店位置便利，去哪裡都很方便。 |飯店餐廳也很乾淨，味道也不錯。,"It is comfortable and has an easy -to -use layout.| Washing pot is very large and easy to use.| Shower is also very easy to use.| Towel bath towels are changed every time | The front desk is very friendly and happy.| The location of the restaurant is convenient, and it is convenient to go.| The restaurant and restaurant are also very clean and the taste is good."
這次選擇了amba來一個小小的staycation。想體驗台北城中山商圈的氛圍，義舍是很棒的選擇。 ||飯店的位置在淡水信義線的中山站與雙連站之間，來往市中心各地極為方便，週邊也有許多知名餐廳、居酒屋。飯店本身設計活潑新穎，燈光偏暗，整體氛圍比較年輕，可能不太適合長輩或嬰兒。房間備品採用薑心比心與京盛宇茶包，品牌的選擇很有年輕活潑感。房間略小但是面中山北路的景緻很好。 ||飯店內的服務人員態度非常友善，也提供了免費的車位。一樓的Buttermilk非常好吃！整體而言是很好的住宿體驗，絕對會再來訪。,"This time I chose AMBA to have a small Staycation.If you want to experience the atmosphere of the Zhongshan business district in Taipei, Yishe is a great choice.|| The location of the hotel is between Zhongshan Station and Shuanglian Station of the Tamsui Shinyi Line. It is very convenient to travel around the city center. There are also many well -known restaurants and izakaya around the surrounding area.The hotel itself is lively and novel, the lights are dark, and the overall atmosphere is relatively young. It may not be suitable for elders or babies.The room reserve uses Jiang Xinxin and the Jingshengyu tea bag. The brand's choice is very young and lively.The room is slightly smaller, but the scenery on the north road of Zhongshan is very good.|| The service staff in the hotel is very friendly and provides free parking spaces.Buttermilk on the first floor is very delicious!Overall is a good accommodation experience, and it will definitely visit again."
在這裡住了一個多星期，房間裡有我需要的一切。床很舒服，地理位置優越，交通便利（步行即可到達兩條受歡迎的地鐵線。淋浴水壓強勁，熱水良好。空調讓我晚上保持涼爽。會再次住在這裡。房間足夠大，可以容納兩個大行李箱。,"I lived here for more than a week, and I have everything I need in the room.The bed is very comfortable, the geographical location is superior, and the traffic is convenient (you can reach two popular subway lines. The shower water is strong and the hot water is good. The air conditioner keeps me cool at night. Two large luggage."
停車場完全是個敗筆，|廁所洗手台在外面的設計也是奇怪的。 |雖然其他的體驗都很好，|但停車場是讓我無法理解的糟糕。 |關於停車場的問題是太小了，我的意思是諾大的酒店只有五個位子太不合理，貴公司有發現最近特約停車場不合作的問題，卻沒有給入住的旅客一點補貼。 |但我必須說整潔與環保意識很棒，個人衛浴用品（牙刷跟剃刀）需要跟櫃台索取這點很棒，但是我入住的時候竟然沒告訴我，你們的員工真的需要更好的訓練。 |飯店的內部擺設很舒適，隔音也很好，最棒的是沐浴空間夠大，這我給予正面的評價。 |因此不建議開車的旅客入住，你若是搭捷運或是接送的旅客，將會有不錯的體驗。,"The parking lot is completely a failure, and the design of the toilet sink outside is also strange.Although the other experiences are good, | but the parking lot is a bad thing that makes me unable to understand.| The problem about the parking lot is too small. I mean that there are only five seats in Nuo Da's hotel. It is too unreasonable. Your company has found the problem that the special parking lot has not cooperated recently, but did not subsidize the passengers who stayed in.| But I have to say that the awareness of cleanliness and environmental protection is great. Personal bathroom supplies (toothbrushes and razors) need to ask for this with the counter, but when I stayed in, I didn't tell me that your employees really need better training.| The interior of the hotel is very comfortable and the sound insulation is also very good. The best thing is that the bathing space is large enough, which I give a positive evaluation.| Therefore, it is not recommended to drive in. If you take the MRT or the passengers who pick up, you will have a good experience."
櫃檯接待人員不是很友善，不是第一次去住，但也住習慣了，希望櫃檯人員在接待時能客氣友善點，餐點非常好。,"The counter reception staff is not very friendly. It is not the first time to live, but it is also used to habit. I hope that the counter personnel will be polite and friendly when receiving the reception. The meal is very good."
希望以美國運通入住時可以提供小卡上註明美運卡的使用規範和條件等，如此以來可以避免工作人員在口頭講述時表達不夠清楚，也能讓房客明確知道如何使用優惠。,"It is hoped that when the U.S. Express will be used to provide the specifications and conditions of the use of the US transportation card on the small card, so that the staff can prevent staff from expressing insufficient expression in orally, and it can also make the tenants clear how to use the discount."
"我能夠保持在合理的價格範圍內。地點是
雖然離地鐵或大眾運輸不是很近，但住的還是蠻舒服的。早餐乾淨又美味，有多種選擇。","I can keep within a reasonable price range.Location
Although it is not very close to the subway or the public, it is quite comfortable to live.Breakfast is clean and delicious, there are many options."
這家酒店是一家精品酒店，風格簡約，配備優秀的員工，並且靠近地鐵站。 ||我預訂了帶陽台的特大號床間，對房間的大小和設施感到驚喜，包括大型現代化淋浴間和 Toto 馬桶座圈。  自助早餐種類豐富，選擇多樣。  ||如果住在中山，不要忽略這個價格合理的寶石。感謝肖恩和團隊其他成員為我們帶來了愉快的體驗。,"This hotel is a boutique hotel, with simple style, excellent employees, and close to subway stations.|| I booked a large bed with a balcony, and I was surprised to the size and facilities of the room, including large modern shower rooms and TOTO toilet seats.The types of buffet breakfast are rich in types and diverse choices.|| If you live in Zhongshan, don't ignore this reasonable price of gems.Thanks to the other members of the team for bringing us a pleasant experience."
"漂亮的現代西式房間。飯店位置很好，距離饒河夜市步行5分鐘。
工作人員很樂於助人而且友善。","Beautiful modern western room.The location of the hotel is very good, walking 5 minutes from Raohe Night Market.
The staff is very happy and friendly."
從飯店步行至地鐵站約5分鐘便可到達，途經的地方很悠閑，很多時裝店，有很多人會在這裡聚會，附近有family mart。今次提前與飯店客服預訂家人的生日驚喜，有一小件蛋糕、卡片及掛飾，感謝安排🥰下次來台北會再次入住！ …,"It can be arrived in about 5 minutes from the hotel to the subway station. The place where it passes is very leisurely. Many fashion stores, many people will meet here, there are Family Mart nearby.This time, I would like to book the family's birthday with the restaurant customer service. There is a small piece of cake, card and ornaments. Thank you for arranging the next time you come to Taipei to stay again!Mowing"
你好。  我現在是台北中山意舍酒店的客人。  這是我第一次入住 Amba 飯店，感覺再好不過了。  食物、飲料、服務和氣氛都很棒。  他們的餐廳 Buttermilk 非常好，很受當地人歡迎。  他們的地下酒吧 Mud 非常出色。  位置也非常好。  位於中山市中心，距離城市幾乎任何地方都很近。  它也靠近地鐵站。最後，我真的很喜歡有一個獨立的衛生間和（大）步入式淋浴間。  這是我第一次來台北和台灣，我有很多問題。  Shown 和 Neil 知識淵博，樂於助人，而且非常有耐心。  謝謝肖恩和尼爾。我強烈推薦台北中山安巴酒店。,"Hello.I am now a guest at the Yiyishe Hotel, Taipei.This is the first time I stayed at the AMBA Hotel, and it feels better.Food, drinks, services and atmosphere are great.Their restaurant Buttermilk is very good and is very popular with locals.Their underground bar MUD is excellent.The location is also very good.Located in the center of Zhongshan City, it is close to almost anywhere in the city.It is also close to the subway station.In the end, I really like to have an independent bathroom and (big) step -by -step shower.This is the first time I have come to Taipei and Taiwan. I have many problems.Shown and Neil are knowledgeable, helpful, and very patient.Thank you Sean and Neil.I strongly recommend Taipei Zhongshan Anba Hotel."
雖然離地鐵有點遠，但氣氛還算安靜。服務也很好。沒有任何錯誤，這很好^^,"Although a bit far from the subway, the atmosphere is quiet.The service is also very good.No mistake, this is good ^^"
週邊環境不錯，靠近紅線地鐵或步行即可到達。 「Buttermilk」連鎖餐廳位於飯店樓下。,"The surrounding environment is good, near the red line subway or walking.""Buttermilk"" chain restaurant is located downstairs in the hotel."
喜歡這個地方！住得很愉快，工作人員非常樂於助人。房間非常乾淨舒適，甚至還有洗衣房（儘管它有開放和關閉時間，所以一定要計劃好你的洗衣時間）。絕對向我在台北尋找住宿地點的朋友推薦這家酒店！,"Like this place!Living well, the staff was very helpful.The room is very clean and comfortable, and there are even laundry rooms (although it has open and closed time, so you must plan your laundry time).Absolutely recommend this hotel from friends who are looking for accommodation in Taipei!"
11 月份，我和先生在這裡住了 2 個晚上。 |位置很棒。前往中山火車站、雙連火車站、雙連潮市場、寧夏路夜市的交通十分便利。 |我預訂了一間雙床房。還有可以放下兩個行李箱的空間，所以我覺得夠寬敞。洗髮精等生活用品都有，但是入住的時候會被問到是否需要牙刷之類的東西，所以如果需要的話請主動索取。 |入住時的工作人員會說英語，退房時的工作人員會說日語。請注意，客人需支付押金。 |有冰箱。 |提供即溶咖啡、茶和糖果。 |沒有浴缸，只有淋浴間。 |提供一套設計可愛的沙灘涼鞋作為房間鞋。 |離開房間後，你會發現一個類似大廳的區域有一張大桌子和椅子，可以在那裡吃外賣。 |事實上，住在那裡的大家庭吃得很開心。 |我住了兩晚，沒有任何問題。我計劃下次再住在那裡。,"In November, my husband and I lived here for two nights.| The location is great.Traffic from Zhongshan Railway Station, Shuanglian Railway Station, Shuanglian Chao Market, and Ningxia Road Night Market is very convenient.| I booked a double bed.There is also space to put down two suitcases, so I feel spacious.There are daily necessities such as shampoos, but when you check in, you will be asked if you need toothbrushes and other things, so if you need it, please take the initiative to ask.| Staff at the time of check -in will speak English, and the staff when checking out will speak Japanese.Please note that guests need to pay the deposit.| There is a refrigerator.| Provide iconic coffee, tea and candy.| There is no bathtub, only a shower.| Provide a set of cute beach sandals as room shoes.| After leaving the room, you will find a large table and chair similar to a hall that can eat takeaway there.| In fact, the big family living there is very happy.| I lived for two nights, and there was no problem.I plan to live there next time."
交通便利，離中山商圈非常近，附近有好逛的店和好吃的餐廳。 |喜歡房間的大窗戶，可看到路樹的綠意，房間乾淨整潔，寢具枕頭床墊好睡舒適，人員服務也很滿意，退房後發現有一本書留在房間，告知客服也儘速幫忙寄回，下次會想再入住。,"It is convenient for transportation and is very close to the Zhongshan business district. There are good shops nearby and delicious restaurants.| Like the large window of the room, you can see the greenness of the road tree, the room is clean and tidy, the bedding pillow mattress is comfortable and comfortable, and the personnel services are also very satisfied. After checking out, I found a book staying in the room. Help back, I want to stay again next time."
根據飯店的定位與定價，從入住到退房，無論居住、服務、飲食和地理位置一切都無從挑剔。 |唯一的提醒給開車的旅人，此酒店提供非常有限的停車位，因此有停車需求的旅客根據酒店建議，在即將抵達時可向酒店櫃檯確認停車的可能性。,"According to the positioning and pricing of the hotel, from check -in to check -out, everything is unavoidable regardless of living, service, diet and geographical location.| The only reminder to the traveler of the car provides a very limited parking space, so passengers with parking demand can confirm the possibility of parking from the hotel counter when they are about to arrive."
接待處最好和最差的，取決於櫃檯後面的人。那麼……那就是另一個故事了。早餐工作人員一點也不友善。他們更忙於擦桌子，而不是檢查自助餐是否缺少任何東西。窗戶上覆蓋著一層不透明的薄膜。以至於無法知道天氣是晴天還是陰天！更不用說幽閉恐懼症的感覺了（視線隱藏，窗戶打不開）。你應該提到這一點。我會預訂另一個房間，或另一家飯店。服務不夠好，讓我忘了房間的不便,"The best and worst reception is depending on the person behind the counter.Then ... that's another story.Breakfast staff is not friendly at all.They are more busy wiping the table instead of checking whether the buffet lacks anything.The window is covered with an opaque film.So that the weather is sunny or cloudy!Not to mention the feeling of clarity phobia (the sight is hidden, the windows cannot be opened).You should mention this.I will book another room, or another restaurant.The service is not good enough, let me forget the inconvenience in the room"
舒適的設計師酒店——比預期的好很多，原因有很多，例如有衛洗麗馬桶、漂亮的淋浴、很好的洗髮精和護髮素。  去很多地方也很方便。,"Comfortable designer hotels -much better than expected, there are many reasons, such as Wei Yuli toilet, beautiful shower, good shampoos and conditioner.It is also convenient to go to many places."
靠近中山、雙連，交通便利。酒店設施齊全。請注意，除非您提出要求，否則我們不會提供牙刷。每層電梯前的空間都非常適合買早餐回家路上吃。然而房間裡除了電視前的椅子之外沒有什麼可以坐的，所以我只能在床上度過。跟商務飯店價格差不多，沒辦法。,"Near Zhongshan and Shuanglian, convenient transportation.The hotel facilities are complete.Please note that we will not provide a toothbrush unless you make a request.The space in front of each elevator is very suitable for buying breakfast and going home.However, there is nothing to sit except the chair in front of the TV, so I can only spend on the bed.It is similar to the price of a business restaurant, there is no way."
飯店位於中山北路，是個逛逛的好地方，也靠近購物區。步行約10分鐘即可到達中山站或秀蓮地鐵站。巴士站距離酒店約3分鐘步行路程。房間寬敞且明亮，適合獨行旅客。只是客房外面的電梯和客廳光線不夠。,"The hotel is located on Zhongshan North Road. It is a good place to visit and is close to the shopping area.You can reach Zhongshan Station or Xiulian Metro Station for about 10 minutes.The bus stop is about 3 minutes of walking.The room is spacious and bright, suitable for alone travelers.It's just that the elevators and living room outside the room are not enough."
"房間相對較新且相當寬敞（可以放2個大行李！）。我們預訂了陽台雙床房/陽台特大床房，可以位於同一樓層，建築佈局方形（公共區域有公共桌/椅。

房間裡有一個大廁所，有獨立的步入式淋浴間，配有花灑/手持噴霧（良好的水壓/溫度控制）和廁所（帶電動坐浴盆），以及化妝/洗臉盆的干燥區。床上已經有 4 個枕頭（哇！）而且很舒服。

辦理入住手續的大廳很小，但有電梯通往各個樓層。如果您僅預訂客房，則可單獨支付早餐費用（約新台幣 500/人）。館內設有洗衣機。

飯店位於主幹道沿線，但沒有直通車（即只能在路邊停車，下車步行5m到達飯店），但可以認為是非中心位置。然而，飯店的房間品質非常高，而且距離雙連站較近。這是您返回台北前最後一晚住宿的好地方，或是您出發前往其他地區之前第一晚住宿的好地方。

如果您需要三人間，請選擇大型加大雙人床間，然後要求飯店加床。陽台太小，無法添加。

強烈推薦探索
- 往西北走5分鐘就是公園旁的雙連早市（和地鐵站）
- 向南步行5分鐘，過馬路後向左走，您可以找到一些不錯的按摩店（日本遊客經常光顧）。
- 往西步行20分鐘到達寧夏夜市（人行道超密集），再步行5分鐘到達迪化商業街（步行街1公里）","The room is relatively new and quite spacious (you can put 2 big luggage!).We book a balcony double -bed room/balcony large bed room, which can be located on the same floor.

There is a large toilet in the room, with an independent step -by -step shower room, equipped with shower/hand -held spray (good water pressure/temperature control) and toilet (with an electric medium cottage), as well as a dry area for makeup/washbasin.There are 4 pillows on the bed (wow!) And very comfortable.

The lobby of the check -in procedure is small, but there are elevators leading to various floors.If you only book a room, you can pay the breakfast fee separately (about NT $ 500/person).There is a washing machine in the museum.

The hotel is located along the main road, but there is no direct traffic (that is, you can only park on the side of the road, and get off the car for 5M to the hotel), but it can be considered to be a central position.However, the quality of the hotel's room is very high, and it is closer to Shuanglian Station.This is a good place for you to stay in the last night before returning to Taipei, or a good place for you to stay in the first night before you set off to other regions.

If you need a three -person room, please select a large -scale increase in the two beds, and then ask the hotel to add bed.The balcony is too small to add.

Strongly recommend exploration
-5 minutes to the northwest is Shuanglian Morning Market (Hehe Station) next to the park
-5 minutes to walk south and walk left after crossing the road, you can find some good massage shops (Japanese tourists often patronize).
-At 20 minutes to the Ningxia Night Market (the sidewalk is super dense), and walk for another 5 minutes to Dihua Commercial Street (1 km by pedestrian street)"
有一個標準的雙胞胎，房間乾淨整潔，有點局促。我們把桌子移開，這樣就可以更輕鬆地到達床上……遙控窗簾很酷。免費瓶裝水是額外的福利。也許下次我會選擇更大的房間。,"There is a standard twins, the room is clean and tidy, and it is a bit cramped.We remove the table so that we can reach the bed more easily ... The remote control curtains are cool.Free bottle water is additional benefits.Maybe I will choose a larger room next time."
我要求一間面向主幹道且有林木線的房間。這也是飯店的賣點之一。在第一個不眠之夜之後，我發現這是一個錯誤。窗戶不是雙層玻璃。摩托車噪音無法被隔離。前台也無能為力，立刻從抽屜裡拿出了兩副耳塞。  幸運的是，第二天早上安排了換房，因為大部分房間都面向主幹道。,"I asked a room to face the main road and there is a forest line.This is also one of the selling points of the hotel.After the first night of sleep, I found that this was a mistake.The windows are not double glass.Motorcycle noise cannot be isolated.The front desk was powerless and immediately took out two earplugs out of the drawer.Fortunately, the next morning was arranged to change the house because most of the rooms were facing the main road."
飯店離中山車站不會遠，隔音不錯，房型空間非常喜歡，使用的盥洗沐浴品也很不錯，離開飯店前還去大廳看了一下使用的品牌，下次入住時想購買。接待人員親切🙏🏻 …,"The hotel will not be far from Zhongshan Station, the sound insulation is good, the room type space is very favorite, the use of the bathing bath products is also very good. Before leaving the hotel, I went to the lobby to see the brand used. I want to buy it next time I stay.Reception staff is kind ..."
"可能是我住過的最好的飯店。絕對是性價比最高的。
他們有一個迷你冰箱，可以存放零食、飲料和藥品，非常棒。

空調很棒

專業且友善的工作人員每天都會打掃房間，他們會盡最大努力確保一切整潔，並且每天更換毛巾。

即使提供小型補充設施（歐洲哪些較大的連鎖飯店不提供或沒有達到如此高的標準）

前台友好的工作人員總是幫助我四處走動，並安排每日出租車服務和旅途中的早餐

每層樓都有一個公共區域
他們的自助洗衣機沒有弄壞我的衣服（但他們也提供乾洗服務）

在這裡住了一個月。 703間房間，下次來還會住這裡。","It may be the best restaurant I have ever lived.It is definitely the most cost -effective.
They have a mini refrigerator that can store snacks, drinks and medicines, which is great.

The air conditioner is great

Professional and friendly staff will clean the rooms every day. They will do their best to ensure that everything is neat and changing towels every day.

Even if the small supplementary facilities are provided (which large chain restaurants in Europe do not provide or have not met such a high standard)

Friendly staff at the front desk always help me walk around, and arrange daily taxi services and breakfast during the journey.

There is a public area on each floor
Their buffet washing machine did not damage my clothes (but they also provided dry cleaning services)

I lived here for a month.703 rooms, I will live here next time."
整體來說很棒的飯店，房間設計得很好。距離兩個火車站大約步行 8 至 10 分鐘 - 但這對我們來說是小事。,"Overall the great restaurant, the room is well designed.It is about 8 to 10 minutes walk from the two railway stations -but this is a trivial matter for us."
在這裡待了 4 天后，我收到了一封酒店發來的電子郵件，詢問我是否帶了他們的中型毛巾……我是 WTH！我從來沒有從酒店拿過毛巾。,"After staying here for 4 days, I received an email from a hotel and asked if I brought their medium towels ... I am WTH!I never took a towel from the hotel."
"入住和退房都很順利。房間漂亮又乾淨。

作為一個遊客來說，這個位置很棒。步行不遠便可到達火車站。寧夏夜市也很近。

總而言之，一定會再回去。","Both check -in and check -up are smooth.The room is beautiful and clean.

As a tourist, this position is great.You can reach the train station not far.Ningxia Night Market is also very close.

All in all, they will definitely go back again."
房間乾淨整潔，工作人員友善|喜歡開放式衣櫃的概念，裡面可以存放行李|洗衣房也很棒，不用找地方洗衣服。 |步行即可到達火車站、購物區和夜市。,"The room is clean and tidy, and the staff is friendly | I like the concept of open wardrobe. It can be stored in luggage | The washing room is also great.| Walk to the train station, shopping area and night market."
"價格：4晚60萬韓元，其實我覺得有點貴，但是，我覺得它有點貴，因為我想找一家光線好、不悶的酒店。

房間+廁所+浴室：我只訂了一張大床，但我預訂時要求換成雙床，但他們換了，所以我用起來更舒服。燈光很好，城市景觀很好，因為它有 8 個房間（百葉窗是自動的）房間很乾淨，我們住的房間浴室外面有一個水槽，廁所和浴室是用透明玻璃隔開的。使用它沒有什麼大的不便，但是，我有點驚訝的是浴室和廁所的門沒有關緊，我認為你和你一起旅行的人需要考慮一下。請自備牙刷、牙膏、盥洗用品！毛巾每天更換，依人數使用小毛巾、普通毛巾、大毛巾。
很高興加熱控制得很好。

其他房間使用：提供咖啡和茶包、咖啡壺和咖啡機，還提供小冰箱和人字拖，還為人數提供每天一次的水。這是一個衣架的概念）。
最棒的是，他們會給你一份紀念品的申請表，例如豐益蘇或牛軋糖餅乾。交貨。

工作人員也很友好，我聽說有人會說韓語，但我沒有見到他哈哈。

沒有要求早餐，所以沒有嘗試，不過一樓有一家餐廳，所以逛了一下，覺得應該可以吃得開心。

總的來說，我對它的使用感到滿意。
唯一的缺點是可以聽到隔壁房間的鼾聲，但皮膚敏感的人可能會覺得很煩人，而且浴室的門是壞的，哈哈。大藍牙揚聲器，它工作正常，但大約10分鐘後它一直斷電。
.ㅎ（上廁所的時候必須打開哈哈）

不過五天四夜還是玩得很開心><","Price: 600,000 won at 4 nights. In fact, I think it is a bit expensive, but I think it is a bit expensive because I want to find a hotel with good light and not stuffy.

Room+toilet+bathroom: I only booked a large bed, but I asked for a double bed when I booked, but they changed it, so I used it more comfortably.The lights are very good, and the urban landscape is very good, because it has 8 rooms (the shutters are automatic) rooms are clean. There is a sink outside the bathroom we live in. The toilet and bathroom are separated by transparent glass.There is no big inconvenience to use it, but I am a little surprised that the door of the bathroom and toilet is not tight. I think the people you traveling with you need to consider it.Please bring your own toothbrush, toothpaste, and scrubbing!The towels are replaced every day, using small towels, ordinary towels, and big towels according to the number of people.
I am glad that heating is well controlled.

Other rooms are used: provided coffee and tea bags, coffee pots and coffee machines, also provided small refrigerators and human characters, and also provided water once a day.This is the concept of a hanger).
The best thing is that they will give you a souvenir application form, such as Fengyisu or nougat biscuits.delivery.

The staff is also very friendly. I heard that someone would speak Korean, but I didn't see him haha.

There is no breakfast, so there is no attempt, but there is a restaurant on the first floor, so after walking, I think I should be able to eat happily.

In general, I am satisfied with it.
The only disadvantage is that you can hear the snoring of the room next door, but people with sensitive skin may feel annoying, and the door of the bathroom is bad, haha.Big Bluetooth speaker, it works normally, but it has been power off for about 10 minutes.
ㅎ (must be opened when going to the toilet haha)

But I am still playing very happily in five days and four nights> <"
在台北性價比很高的飯店。現代佈置與復古家具的獨特融合。早餐也很不錯。有機會在這裡住兩晚並且肯定會再次這樣做。,In Taipei cost -effective restaurants.Modern layout with the unique fusion of retro furniture.Breakfast is also very good.Have a chance to live here for two nights and will definitely do this again.
"這是一家集性價比、交通便利、友善、清潔、氛圍和空間以及舒適床鋪於一身的住宿。

其實我在台北住期間換過3次飯店，空間是最舒服的，性價比也最高。我預訂了一間帶樹景（城市景觀）的中型大床房，但被分配到了三樓的雙床房。我真的很喜歡窗外種滿樹木的景色。房間裡還有藍牙音箱，連接使用很方便。冰箱不大，但可以保持涼爽。

步行約10分鐘即可到達附近地鐵站（紅線、綠線），週邊街道舒適。那裡有一條漂亮可愛的咖啡館街，非常適合散步、咖啡館和購物。從這個住宿出發，我去了西門、永康街、台北101大樓、北投、淡水！

另外...為了紀念我的生日而預訂並通過電子郵件發送後參觀了我還收到了一個小蛋糕，這讓我感動得流淚了。有一則訊息祝您度過一個難忘的生日，我認為這將是一個真正令人難忘的空間<3<3當我去台北時我一定會再次訪問這裡！

+額外.. 不要排隊等待 Chiathe Sunny Hill 的 Pungri 水和果凍，他們會在 24 小時內送貨，沒有任何數量限制。超市沒有太大差別...我錯過了這個太糟糕了，所以如果你沒有太多時間，一定要使用這個服務！","This is an accommodation that is cost -effective, convenient, friendly, clean, atmosphere and space, and comfortable beds.

In fact, I changed the restaurants 3 times during my stay in Taipei. The space is the most comfortable and the most cost -effective.I booked a medium -sized bed room with tree views (urban landscapes), but was assigned to a double bed room on the third floor.I really like the scenery of trees outside the window.There are also Bluetooth speakers in the room, which is convenient to connect.The refrigerator is not large, but it can be kept cool.

You can reach the nearby subway station (red and green lines) for about 10 minutes, and the surrounding streets are comfortable.There is a beautiful and cute cafe street, which is very suitable for walking, cafes and shopping.Starting from this accommodation, I went to Ximen, Yongkang Street, Taipei 101 Building, Beitou, Tamsui!

In addition ... I reserved to commemorate my birthday and sent an email. After visiting, I also received a small cake, which made me cry.There is a message I wish you a unforgettable birthday. I think this will be a truly unforgettable space. <3 <3 When I go to Taipei, I will definitely visit here again!

+Extra .. Don't wait in line to wait for Chiathe Sunny Hill's PUNGRI water and jelly. They will deliver the goods within 24 hours without any quantity limit.There is not much difference in the supermarket ... I miss this too bad, so if you don't have much time, you must use this service!"
"價格不是很便宜，但是地點很好。房間很寬敞。
感覺比我在日本或台中住的飯店寬敞很多。

位置很好，前面的路上有很多樹，附近有一條咖啡館街。
非常好。","The price is not very cheap, but the location is very good.The room is spacious.
It feels much spacious than the restaurants I live in Japan or Taichung.

The location is very good, there are many trees on the road in front, and there is a cafe street nearby.
very good."
地點便利，距離中山站/雙連站步行5-10分鐘。附近有商場、餐廳、便利商店、夜市，步行即可到達。房間很乾淨，前台工作人員非常友善且樂於助人。,地點便利，距離中山站/雙連站步行5-10分鐘。附近有商場、餐廳、便利商店、夜市，步行即可到達。房間很乾淨，前台工作人員非常友善且樂於助人。
"這是我最喜歡的！
窗戶很大，給人一種開闊明亮的感覺。
房間雖小，但設計很有心，所以沒有感覺那麼不方便。
我最喜歡的一點是拖鞋是人字拖！沙灘涼鞋最適合飯店房間👍
前台很有禮貌，一點問題都沒有。
去哪裡都方便。
我不希望價格再上漲。","This is my favorite!
The windows are large, giving a wide open feeling.
Although the room is small, the design is very intentional, so it is not as convenient as it feels.
My favorite point is that slippers are human character drags!Beach sandals are most suitable for hotel rooms 👍
The front desk is very polite, there is no problem at all.
It is convenient to go wherever you go.
I don't want the price to rise again."
設施和房間都很乾淨，所有的工作人員都很友好和友善。有免費洗衣設施，一樓的早餐是美式的，但乾淨又好吃。特別是它位於市中心，靠近著名的餐廳、夜市和旅遊景點，所以在首爾明洞也算是乾淨的飯店。  感謝韓語流利的工作人員，非常感謝他們又免費送了我一雙嬰兒拖鞋。,"The facilities and rooms are very clean, and all staff are friendly and friendly.There are free laundry facilities. The breakfast on the first floor is American, but it is clean and delicious.In particular, it is located in the city center, near the famous restaurant, night market and tourist attractions, so it is also a clean restaurant in Mingdong, Seoul.Thanks to the fluent staff of Korean, thank you very much for sending me a pair of baby slippers for free."
我對整體清潔度和設計非常滿意。客房的設計易於使用且舒適。我想重複一遍。烘乾機是松下製造的，有許多缺陷。事實上，它為您的房間配備了涼鞋，這也使它更具吸引力。早餐為自助式。這是一道台灣特有的清爽菜餚，吃起來不會感到胃部負擔。,"I am very satisfied with the overall cleanliness and design.The design of the rooms is easy to use and comfortable.I want to repeat it.The dryer is made of Panasonic and has many flaws.In fact, it is equipped with sandals for your room, which also makes it more attractive.Breakfast is a self -service type.This is a unique refreshing dish in Taiwan, and it will not feel the burden on the stomach."
"價格不高，房間氛圍也不錯。
我知道退房時間是 12:00。

設施也不錯，房間裡有一雙鞋。

1樓有一家美式餐廳。","The price is not high, and the room atmosphere is also good.
I know that the check -out time is 12:00.

The facilities are also good, there are a pair of shoes in the room.

There is a American restaurant on the first floor."
"一直想體驗中山安巴，終於有機會了。

中山安巴酒店距離中山站3號出口或雙連站2號出口僅8-10分鐘步行路程，位於近年來最時尚的地區。

辦理入住手續很快，房間大小適合 1 或 2 人入住。喜歡簡約的內飾，附有開放式衣櫃。一張簡單的木辦公桌，獨立的浴室和衛生間。

我的房價不包含早餐，但對於經常來台北旅遊的人來說，安巴的三餐選擇很多，從傳統的早餐店、主打優質咖啡的咖啡館，到台灣居酒屋，都在步行範圍內。

強烈推薦這家酒店，因為我在這裡度過了愉快的三晚，並且肯定會再次回來。","I have always wanted to experience Zhongshan Anba, and finally had a chance.

Zhongshan Anba Hotel is only 8-10 minutes of walking away from the exit of Zhongshan Station or Shuanglian Station 2, which is located in the most fashionable area in recent years.

The check -in procedures are fast, and the size of the room is suitable for 1 or 2 people.Like simple interior, with an open wardrobe.Simple wooden office tables, independent bathrooms and bathrooms.

My house prices do not include breakfast, but for those who often come to Taipei, there are many choices for Anba's three meals. From traditional breakfast shops, coffee shops focusing on high -quality coffee, to Taiwan izakaya, they are all walking.

This hotel is highly recommended, because I have a pleasant three nights here, and I will definitely come back again."
飯店地理位置優越，步行即可到達捷運中山站、雙連站，飯店週邊便利商店也很多。但中山站正在裝修，無法使用自動扶梯，從地下三樓提行李箱上來有些困難。會有多一轉乘，不過如果是從松山機場來的話，建議在中山站換乘淡水信義線往雙連站方向，那裡有自動扶梯，很方便(^^),"The hotel has a good geographical location, and you can reach the MRT Zhongshan Station and Shuanglian Station. There are also many convenience stores around the hotel.However, Zhongshan Station is being renovated and cannot use the escalator. It is difficult to raise the suitcase from the third floor of the underground.There will be more transfers, but if you come from Songshan Airport, it is recommended to exchange at Zhongshan Station to the direction of the Danlian Station, there is an automatic escalator, which is very convenient (^^)"
"和我女兒住了一個星期。我的台灣朋友的朋友在旅遊業工作，推薦了這家旅館。從地鐵站到這裡真的很方便，而且附近有很多商店，非常方便。個人覺得中山旁邊的雙連站離飯店比較近。
房間和設施都非常乾淨，飯店的早餐也很棒。
飯店工作人員非常友善，英語溝通也沒有問題。
唯一的缺點是其中一台洗衣機壞了所以有時必須等待使用。
由於航班時刻表，我們需要很早就退房，但餐廳準備了三明治、水果和果汁早餐供外帶。真的很感激。
如果我們有機會回到台北，一定會再次預訂這家酒店！","I lived with my daughter for a week.My friends of my Taiwanese friends work in the tourism industry and recommend this hotel.It is really convenient to come here from the subway station, and there are many stores nearby, which is very convenient.Personally, I think that the Shuanglian station next to Zhongshan is closer.
The rooms and facilities are very clean, and the breakfast in the hotel is also great.
The hotel staff is very friendly, and there is no problem with English communication.
The only disadvantage is that one of the washing machines is broken, so sometimes you have to wait for use.
Due to the flight schedule, we need to check out for a long time, but the restaurant has prepared sandwiches, fruits and juice for breakfast for exterior.Really grateful.
If we have the opportunity to return to Taipei, we will definitely book this hotel again!"
"我總是留在這裡。
我認為從一個地方移動到另一個地方很容易。設施很多，所以基本上不會有任何問題。

還有免費洗衣（雖然我去的時候兩台洗衣機其中一台壞了…）。
有懂日文的人，也有不懂日文的人。不知何故，我透過一些手勢完成了它。
我期待下次再次與您合作。

2024年1月18日至21日
再次感謝你的幫助

之前來的時候有的牙刷、刮鬍刀（可能還有其他的）之類的設施都沒有了。
住宿期間別忘了隨身攜帶（附近有便利商店，可以馬上購買）。","I always stay here.
I think it is easy to move from one place to another.There are many facilities, so there are basically no problems.

There are also free laundry (although one of the two washing machines was broken when I went ...).
There are people who know Japanese, and there are people who do not understand Japanese.I don't know what to do, I finished it through some gestures.
I look forward to cooperating with you again next time.

January 18 to 21, 2024
Thank you again for your help

There were facilities such as toothbrushes, scraper (maybe other), and other facilities.
Don't forget to carry it with you during your accommodation (there are convenience stores nearby, you can buy it immediately)."
"我透過網站預訂了一個角落的房間。
我在2019年使用過它，它仍然友好、乾淨！
房間裡只有一張椅子，所以如果你要求的話，他們會再拿一張給你:)
位於中山咖啡街的中心，非常適合散步！","I book a corner room through the website.
I used it in 2019, it is still friendly and clean!
There is only one chair in the room, so if you ask, they will take another one for you :)
The center of Zhongshan Coffee Street is very suitable for walking!"
飯店距離捷運站大概5分鐘殲程，週邊十分多知名食店及大型商場，便利商店就在附近，員工有禮親切，登記入住手續便，房間整潔，價格亦合理🤗 …,"The hotel is about 5 minutes from the MRT station. There are many well -known restaurants and large shopping malls in the surrounding area. Convenience stores are nearby. Employees are polite and kind, register for check -in procedures, clean rooms, and reasonable prices ..."
位置非常好，靠近地鐵，很容易叫到計程車。乾淨的房間和樂於助人的工作人員。淋浴間的水壓很好。我告訴他們今天是我的生日，他們準備了一個非常漂亮的生日橫幅、布朗尼蛋糕和一瓶紅酒。,"The location is very good, near the subway, it is easy to call a taxi.Clean rooms and helpful staff.The water pressure in the shower room is very good.I told them that today is my birthday, they have prepared a very beautiful birthday banner, Browni cake and a bottle of red wine."
飯店距離中山商圈很近，健行可到。房間雖不大，但五臟俱全，水壓足夠。服務方面沒說得殷勤親切，但人員皆是有禮對答。,"The hotel is very close to the Zhongshan business district, and the hiking can be available.Although the room is not large, the five internal organs are available, and the water pressure is sufficient.The service is not diligent, but the personnel are politely answered."
"看起來比較新。
位置很好，所以我想再待在那裡。","It looks new.
The location is very good, so I want to stay there again."

步行即可到達林森北路的酒吧區。房間非常乾淨，設施齊全。早餐是自助式的，很一般，食材也很基本。考慮到位置，價格是否在可接受的範圍內？,"Walk to the bar area on Linden North Road.The room is very clean and complete.Breakfast is buffet, very average, and the ingredients are very basic.Considering the location, is the price within the acceptable range?"
我為隔離期間預訂了一間大型客房。房間、裝潢和內容與飯店網站上顯示的一模一樣。床很舒服，房間很安靜，讓您住得非常安靜。酒店管理層迅速而專業地處理了問題。菜單每週更換一次，有多種菜餚可供選擇。也提供多種素食和純素食選項。菜餚很美味而且食物總是很新鮮。接待人員總是很友好，樂於助人。我會推薦給任何正在尋找隔離套餐的人。,"I book a large room for the isolation.The room, decoration and content are exactly the same as the display on the hotel website.The bed is very comfortable and the room is quiet, so that you live very quietly.The hotel management handled the problem quickly and professional.The menu is replaced once a week, and there are many dishes to choose from.It also provides a variety of vegetarian and vegan.The dishes are delicious and the food is always fresh.Receptions are always friendly and helpful.I will recommend to anyone who is looking for isolation packages."
"位於中山站附近，交通便利。
房間乾淨而且足夠寬敞。
設施也不錯。
推薦的飯店有這些設施和價格。
我住得很舒服。","Located near Zhongshan Station, the transportation is convenient.
The room is clean and spacious.
The facilities are also good.
The recommended hotels are these facilities and prices.
I live comfortably."
"如果你讓我推薦台北一個經濟實惠的住宿地點，我會說中山意捨酒店。

我們選擇住在角落的房間，有足夠的空間容納我們兩個人和行李。房間和設施都很乾淨，工作人員很友好，樂於助人。

地點對旅客來說很方便，因為它靠近中山捷運站，被認為是最繁忙的車站之一。最重要的是，附近有一個叫寧夏的夜市。","If you let me recommend a economic affordable accommodation place in Taipei, I will say Zhongshan Yishe Hotel.

We choose to live in the corner room, with enough space to accommodate the two of us and luggage.The rooms and facilities are very clean, and the staff are friendly and helpful.

The location is very convenient for passengers because it is close to Zhongshan MRT station and is considered one of the busiest stations.Most importantly, there is a night market called Ningxia nearby."
方便、友善、價格合理的飯店,"Convenient, friendly, and reasonable restaurants"
地點非常便利，距離Teipei火車站步行約15-20分鐘。步行30分鐘即可抵達美麗、涼爽的河岸公園。,"The location is very convenient, about 15-20 minutes away from the TeiPei railway station.You can reach the beautiful and cool river bank park for 30 minutes."
地點便利，步行10分鐘即可到達2個地鐵站。在台北日益昂貴的飯店中，這是一家價格合理且時尚的飯店。,"The location is convenient, and you can reach 2 subway stations for 10 minutes.In Taipei's increasingly expensive restaurants, this is a reasonable and fashionable restaurant."
"讓我們明確一點——我們愛 Amba。一直是我們回到TPE的第一選擇！

飯店位於中山站附近，事實上，我們總是從台北站直接步行穿過中山地下步行街。只需從 R9 出口（有電梯和自動扶梯）離開街道，步行 3 分鐘即可到達。附近有很多巴士、地鐵、優步、計程車。您甚至可以在您旁邊找到 ubiike 2.0 車站。便利商店（是的，很多）距離酒店前門實際上僅幾步之遙。該地區已翻新，附近有許多新的小酒館。

飯店能夠維持它的優良品質－友善的員工、良好的（最小的）設施和美麗的城市景觀。我們預訂了一間轉角大床房，以為會更大，但我們發現特殊的配置讓房間感覺比實際數字要小。不過，房間夠大，空調充足（台北不常見），還有舒適的羽絨被。

然而，浴室可以更大（如果有浴缸就更好了）。房間裡的另一個抱怨是固定電視，即使在床上看電視也可能有點太低了。不過，我們還是會時不時地回來，它仍然是我們留在TPE的首選。","Let us be more clear -we love AMBA.It has always been our first choice to return to TPE!

The hotel is located near Zhongshan Station. In fact, we always walk directly through Taipei Station through the underground pedestrian street of Zhongshan.Just leave the street from R9 (with elevators and escalators) and walk for 3 minutes.There are many buses, subways, Uber, and taxis nearby.You can even find the Ubiike 2.0 station next to you.Convenience stores (yes, many) are actually only a few steps away from the front door of the hotel.The area has been renovated, and there are many new tavern nearby.

The restaurant can maintain its excellent quality -friendly employees, good (smallest) facilities and beautiful urban landscapes.We book a large corner bed room, thinking that it will be bigger, but we find that the special configuration makes the room feel smaller than the actual figure.However, the room is large enough, the air conditioner is sufficient (Taipei is not common), and there are comfortable down quilts.

However, the bathroom can be larger (if there is a bathtub, it is better).Another complaint in the room is a fixed TV, and it may be a bit too low to watch TV in bed.However, we will still come back from time to time, and it is still the first choice for us to stay in TPE."
雖然預訂體驗不太好，但最終一切順利。我住的房間佈置很奇怪，水槽和鏡子就在床前面。廁所就在前門旁邊，淋浴間在房間裡稍微遠一點。上完廁所後還要走到床邊洗手，有點奇怪。,"Although the booking experience is not very good, everything goes well in the end.The room I stayed was strange, and the sink and mirror were in front of the bed.The toilet is next to the front door, and the shower room is slightly farther in the room.After going to the toilet, I have to go to the bed to wash my hands, which is a bit strange."
"房間小而乾淨，服務差。
早餐在隔壁的酒吧供應，選擇很少，品質也很差。
地點不錯，但是門口沒有停車場，不太方便。","The room is small and clean, and the service is poor.
Breakfast is supplied at the bar next door, with few choices and poor quality.
The location is good, but there is no parking lot at the door, which is not convenient."
很容易被隔壁或樓上的客人吵醒。沒有隔音效果。此外，沒有行李員或禮賓服務來幫助您辦理入住或退房行李服務。當要求幫忙帶回一大件退房行李時，前台顯得很驚訝。安，這次還可以，但不會再留在這個品牌了。,"It is easy to be awakened by the guests next door or upstairs.No sound insulation effect.In addition, there are no luggage officers or concierge services to help you handle your check -in or check -out baggage services.The front desk was surprised when he asked for help to bring back a large check -in luggage.Ann, this time it is okay, but will not stay in this brand anymore."
地點非常棒，離中山捷運站和雙連捷運站都很近，附近生活機能很好，房間小但是備品很齊全，住起來舒服乾淨，下次還會再入住。,The location is very good. It is very close to the Zhongshan MRT station and the Danglian MRT station. The nearby life function is very good. The room is small but the preparations are complete.
這是我第二次來，因為我很高興上次住在那裡。 ||這個概念是環保和可回收的，因此無論您走到哪裡，它都是高效和舒適的。 ||淋浴間寬敞，門密閉，即使在豪華飯店，也不會有熱水從淋浴間滲出的機會。 ||工作人員也很隨意、友善，讓我感覺非常好。 ||||位置就在中山站和雙連站之間，步行5分鐘多一點，不過隔壁國賓大酒店門口就有公車站，機場來的公車好像也停在這裡。 （我們從飯店到台北車站之間是步行+捷運，回程時搭乘計程車。）,"This is my second time because I am glad to live there last time.|| This concept is environmentally friendly and recyclable, so no matter where you go, it is efficient and comfortable.|| The shower room is spacious and the door is closed. Even in a luxury hotel, there will be no chance of hot water from the shower room.|| The staff is also casual and friendly, making me feel very good.|||| The location is between Zhongshan Station and Shuanglian Station. There are more than 5 minutes walking, but there is a bus station at the door of the Binbin Hotel next door. The bus from the airport also stops here.(From the hotel to Taipei Station, there are walking+MRT. Take a taxi during the return journey.)"
這家精品酒店舒適且一切都考慮周到。便利設施專為您帶回家並重複使用而設計。他們擁有您需要的一切，只需詢問即可。位置優越，位於城鎮較安靜的地方。簡單但非常好的早餐選擇。我們的最愛之一。,"This boutique hotel is comfortable and thoughtful.Convenience facilities are designed for you to take home and reuse it.They have everything you need, just ask.The location is superior, located in a relatively quieter in the town.Simple but very good breakfast choice.One of our favorite."
我每年將其作為出差5至6次的常規住宿，每次約3晚。友好的工作人員、現代化、維護良好、乾淨明亮的房間以及令人滿意的設施。 ||||重點不是地毯而是地板。我認為這可以使房間沒有灰塵、食物溢出和飲料污漬，讓客人感到舒適。 ||||不過床的長度（高度）比西方飯店要短一些，雖然我172cm，但我覺得如果再長10cm就可以睡得更舒服了。,"I take it as a conventional accommodation 5 to 6 times a year, about 3 nights each time.Friendly staff, modern, well -maintained, clean and bright rooms, and satisfactory facilities.|||| The point is not the carpet but the floor.I think this can make the room have no dust, food overflow and drink stains, making guests feel comfortable.|||| But the length of the bed (height) is shorter than the Western restaurant. Although I 172cm, I think it can sleep more comfortably if you 10cm longer."
有機場巴士可以立刻送你去機場，而且設施也很舒服，很好，交通也很近，所以去台灣旅遊很方便:),"There are airport bus you can send you to the airport immediately, and the facilities are very comfortable, very good, and the transportation is very close, so it is convenient to travel to Taiwan :)"
"這是一家時尚簡約的飯店。

價格也很合理，

"在隔離室住了 7 天，很標準，但有你需要的一切。  擁有陽台的好處是讓隔離變得更容易忍受。
食物很美味，牛排都是頂級切塊。 WhatsApp 通訊讓整個過程變得簡單..推薦👍","I lived in the isolation room for 7 days, very standard, but everything you need.The advantage of having a balcony is to make isolation easier to endure.
The food is delicious, and steaks are top -level cuts.WhatsApp communication makes the entire process simple .. Recommended 👍"
有會說日語的工作人員，所以可以放心。房間寬敞舒適，適合我長期住宿！不過，正如其他人所寫的，暖氣不起作用，所以冬天感覺有點冷。便利設施很豐富。他們有甜的碳酸水（我想嚐嚐三谷蘋果酒），還有可以帶回家的人字拖。工作人員面帶微笑，很容易交談。這是一家即使是第一次從海外來訪的客人也可以放心入住的酒店。,"There are people who speak Japanese, so you can rest assured.The room is spacious and comfortable, suitable for my long -term accommodation!However, as other people wrote, the heating does not work, so it feels a bit cold in winter.Convenience facilities are rich.They have sweet carbonate (I want to taste the Midi apple wine), and the characters that can be taken home.The staff smiled and it was easy to talk.This is a hotel where guests visiting overseas can stay at ease."
房間很乾淨 設備都很新 隔音也很好 交通也很方便 附近有蠻多吃的下次如果還有來北部玩 會想找親戚朋友一起來入住,The rooms are very clean. The equipment is very new and the sound insulation is very good and the transportation is very good.
非常好的飯店，靠近中山地鐵站（紅線），靠近許多景點和夜市。房間乾淨寬敞。  幸運的是升級到了有陽台的房間。,"Very good restaurants, near Zhongshan Metro Station (red line), near many attractions and night markets.The room is clean and spacious.Fortunately, it was upgraded to a room with a balcony."
"比較時尚的一家酒店。
地理位置優越。

不只從地鐵站出發，從松山機場搭計程車也約140台幣。
吃喝都沒有問題。

最棒的是，房間很乾淨。

還有牙刷等生活用品。
我們提供精美的沙灘涼鞋（您可以帶回家）供您在房間穿著，因此您不需要拖鞋。

接待處的英語當然沒問題。
有時也會有會說日語的女性。

不奢華。
它很休閒而且相當寬敞。
如果您正在尋找美麗的住宿，我們建議您在成本平衡的情況下入住。

正如其他人所寫的，似乎沒有任何暖氣，所以冬天需要考慮這一點。這個冬天真是令人驚奇。","A more fashionable hotel.
Geographical location is superior.

Not only starting from the subway station, but also about 140 Taiwan dollars from Songshan Airport.
There is no problem eating and drinking.

The best thing is that the room is clean.

There are also daily necessities such as toothbrushes.
We provide exquisite beach sandals (you can take home) for you to wear in the room, so you don't need slippers.

Of course, English at the reception is okay.
Sometimes there are women who can speak Japanese.

Not luxurious.
It is very casual and quite spacious.
If you are looking for beautiful accommodation, we recommend that you stay in a cost balance.

As other people wrote, there seems to be no heating, so this needs to be considered in winter.This winter is really amazing."
非常喜歡這家飯店，房間設計型格前衛又新，因於較早前應該進行了翻新。方間設施也好，有舒適感。 另外，地下西餐廳環境舒服，食物好味，價格也不貴。 飯店地點靠近兩個地下鐵車站，出行往其他區域非常方便。再去台灣也會回去中山區意舍飯店。,"I really like this hotel. The room design is avant -garde and new, because it should be refurbished earlier.The square facilities are good and comfortable.In addition, the underground western restaurant is comfortable, the food is good, and the price is not expensive.The hotel location is close to two underground railway stations, and it is very convenient to travel to other areas.Going to Taiwan will go back to Yishe Hotel, Zhongshan District."
一進到大廳CI就有一種很美式的慵懶感，就讓我非常期待入住的房間～一進房門也沒有讓人失望房間的燈搭配窗外的陽光真的很想讓人一直賴在房內電梯出來的椅子也很放鬆～尤其一樓的座位區在那邊休息看看窗外也是很好的放鬆模式早餐的部分有很多樣式會讓人再次期待入住❤️,"As soon as I entered the lobby CI, there is a very American laziness, which makes me look forward to the room I stayed. When I entered the door, I did not disappoint the lights of the room with the sun outside the window. The chairs from the elevator are also very relaxed ~ Especially the seat area on the first floor is resting over there to see that it is also a good relaxation mode for breakfast."
非常現代、乾淨的飯店。我住了 3 個晚上，在清潔、服務或友善方面沒有什麼可抱怨的。因為位於市中心，所以附近有很多餐館，搬到其他地方也很方便。早餐來不及吃，不過一樓的咖啡廳也很現代、乾淨，所以很多人都在用。由於前面有寬大的窗戶，房間給人一種涼爽明亮的感覺，除了浴室位於床邊之外，沒有什麼可擔心的。,"Very modern and clean restaurant.I lived for 3 nights and had nothing to complain about in terms of cleaning, service or friendship.Because it is located in the city center, there are many restaurants nearby, which is also convenient to move to other places.Breakfast is too late to eat, but the cafe on the first floor is also very modern and clean, so many people are using it.Because there is a large window in front, the room gives a cool and bright feeling. There is nothing to worry about except the bathroom is located by the bed."
房間不豪華，但簡約、時尚。 ||位置便利，步行即可到達中山站，附近還有便利商店。 ||||自助早餐很美味，選擇也很豐富。 ||（不過週末好像種類比較多。）||||感覺適合大人單獨出行，因為離工作人員的距離還算合理。 ||||有時我們有會說日語的員工，有時則沒有。 ||我覺得性價比高。 ,"The room is not luxurious, but simple and fashionable.The location is convenient, and you can reach Zhongshan Station. There are also convenience stores nearby.|||| The buffet breakfast is delicious and the choice is also very rich.|| (But there seems to be many types on weekends.) |||| It feels suitable for adults to travel alone, because the distance from the staff is quite reasonable.|||| Sometimes we have a Japanese employee, sometimes there is no.|| I think cost -effective.Bleak"
雖然由於計劃的改變我們最終沒有住在這裡，但到目前為止我還是想對他們的服務留下評論。不幸的是，由於我丈夫的家人意外死亡，我們需要在最後一刻安排旅行，隔離過程非常混亂。 Amba 的系統非常有條理，當您透過他們的線上預訂系統預訂時，他們會為您提供英文和中文的詳細資訊。我們很緊張，因為他們預先要求支付押金，但事實證明，他們非常包容我們改變計劃，並且沒有因為我們取消而懲罰我們。工作人員透過電話和線上聊天非常敏感和樂於助人，他們幫助我們回答了很多問題，甚至是小問題，例如是否有英語電視。基於他們的幫助，我們將來肯定會再次考慮他們，並推薦他們的隔離住宿服務。,"Although we did not live here due to the change of the plan, so far I still want to comment on their services.Unfortunately, because my husband's family died unexpectedly, we needed to arrange travel at the last moment, and the isolation process was very chaotic.AMBA's system is very reasonable. When you book your online booking system, they will provide you with detailed information about English and Chinese.We are very nervous because they ask for a deposit in advance, but it turns out that they are very tolerant of our plan and not punished us because we cancel.The staff is very sensitive and helpful through the phone and online chat. They helped us answer many questions, even small questions, such as whether there are English TVs.Based on their help, we will definitely consider them again in the future and recommend their isolation accommodation services."
我們台灣之行一共在中山義舍酒店住了4晚。我們在接待處受到了非常友好的歡迎。一進大廳就知道這是一家非常時尚的設計飯店，裝潢非常注重細節。我們被升級到五樓的一間角落房間（可以看到樹梢和街道的景色）。房間真的非常年輕和現代。我們特別喜歡牆上的裱框圖形。洗浴用品也是最高品質的。房間很乾淨。早餐很美味而且精心準備，儘管個別產品的選擇還可以更多一些。飯店二樓設有洗衣房。在那裡你可以免費洗衣服並烘乾（非常實用，特別是如果你要長時間旅行）。我要特別強調接待處年輕女士的友好和禮貌的行為，其中一 …,"Our trip to Taiwan lived in the Yishe Hotel in Zhongshan for 4 nights.We were very friendly at the reception.As soon as you enter the hall, you know that this is a very fashionable design restaurant, and the decoration pays great attention to details.We were upgraded to a corner room on the fifth floor (you can see the treetops and the streets of the street).The room is really young and modern.We especially like the frames on the wall.Baths are also the highest quality.The room is very clean.Breakfast is delicious and carefully prepared, although the choice of individual products can be more.There is a laundry room on the second floor of the hotel.There you can wash and dry it for free (very practical, especially if you have to travel for a long time).I want to particularly emphasize the friendly and polite behavior of the young lady in the reception office, one of them ..."
"這是我最喜歡的飯店。

我們在一樓的咖啡廳吃早餐。
週末的種類似乎比較多。一邊看風景一邊欣賞，真是太好了。

房間本身不是很豪華，但考慮到裡面的東西，我認為它相當時尚且便宜。
還，
沒有日語工作人員，但會說基本的日語。

我覺得適合一個人旅行。","This is my favorite restaurant.

We have breakfast on the cafe on the first floor.
There seems to be more types of weekends.It's great to enjoy the scenery while watching the scenery.

The room itself is not very luxurious, but considering the things inside, I think it is quite fashionable and cheap.
return,
There is no Japanese staff member, but they can speak basic Japanese.

I think it is suitable for traveling alone."
在這裡住了 3 天，有一個面向街道/小街的角落房間。聽不到任何噪音，房間佈置得充滿愛。大量免費衛浴用品，每天免費2瓶水。無線網路速度極快——在飯店裡撥打西澳電話時很少有如此好的語音品質。接待處非常友好和周到。大廳旁邊是「Buttermilk」餐廳，供應早餐、午餐和晚餐。看起來台北人常光顧的時尚餐廳。我很想明年再來,"I lived here for 3 days, and there was a corner room facing the street/street.If you can't hear any noise, the room is full of love.A large number of free bathroom products, 2 bottles of water for free per day.Wireless network speed is very fast -there are few good voice quality when calling Western Australia calls in the hotel.The reception is very friendly and thoughtful.Next to the hall is the ""Buttermilk"" restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner.It looks like Taipei people often patronize fashion restaurants.I really want to come again next year"
乾淨、安全的飯店，物超所值。地點方便，購物吃飯都很方便。接待、客房清潔服務都很好。推薦酪乳和泥棒。,"Clean and safe restaurants are worthy of money.The location is convenient, and it is convenient to eat and eat.Reception and room cleaning services are very good.Recommended liquids and mud sticks."
"工作人員很友好，但就其價格而言，酒店結構很差。房間沒有可打開的窗戶，早餐選擇有限。
既然是強制隔離，設施應該會更好！","The staff is very friendly, but as far as its price is concerned, the hotel structure is very poor.There are no windows that can be opened in the room, and the breakfast choices are limited.
Since it is forced isolation, facilities should be better!"
辦理入住手續時，我看到了一間寬敞的房間。使用木材（用於家具）和藤條（用於地板）代替織物和地毯。出發前有足夠的準備空間是一個主要優點。下次來台北一定還會住這家飯店！ :),"When I checked in, I saw a spacious room.Use wood (for furniture) and rattan (for floor) instead of fabrics and carpets.There is enough room for preparation before departure is a major advantage.Next time you come to Taipei, you will still stay in this hotel!:)"
這是我在台北中山地區的第三家飯店，之前住過日航飯店和逸林飯店。 ||房間乾淨，設施齊全。早餐菜單也很豐富。二樓好像有洗衣機，這次我沒用，不過如果住的時間長的話可能會派上用場。下次還想住這裡，因為性價比很高。,這是我在台北中山地區的第三家飯店，之前住過日航飯店和逸林飯店。 ||房間乾淨，設施齊全。早餐菜單也很豐富。二樓好像有洗衣機，這次我沒用，不過如果住的時間長的話可能會派上用場。下次還想住這裡，因為性價比很高。
優秀而美麗的酒店。太棒了，喜歡它。,"Excellent and beautiful hotel.It's great, like it."
服務好、設施好、早餐也很好。希望有綠意，所以選擇麵馬路的低樓層。室內好安靜，窗外好舒壓。整體好喜歡，還會再來。,服務好、設施好、早餐也很好。希望有綠意，所以選擇麵馬路的低樓層。室內好安靜，窗外好舒壓。整體好喜歡，還會再來。
地點優越的新時尚酒店，物超所值。街上不太熱鬧，這對我來說是一個優點。喜歡這裡的裝飾，尤其是飯店房間內的膠合板使用，但他們的服務還有改進的空間。工作人員非常可愛，讓我們將退房時間延長到下午 2 點。,"New fashion hotels with superior location are worthy of money.The street is not too lively, which is an advantage for me.Like the decoration here, especially the plywood in the hotel room, but their services still have room for improvement.The staff is very cute, let us extend the check -out time to 2 pm."
非常好的住宿體驗。位於中心位置，公共交通便利。,Very good accommodation experience.It is located in the center and is convenient for public transportation.
有停車位較方便，早餐再多樣化較優，餐廳服務員不錯，櫃檯人員，再多一點和氣與笑容，會更加分，更有人情味一些,有停車位較方便，早餐再多樣化較優，餐廳服務員不錯，櫃檯人員，再多一點和氣與笑容，會更加分，更有人情味一些
飯店感覺很新，風格很特別很酷，房間隔音很好，設備也還不錯，感覺有用心，住起來也很舒服，會想要二訪！ ！,"The hotel feels very new, the style is very cool, the room sounds well, the equipment is not bad, it feels attentive, and it is very comfortable to live in. I want to visit the second visit!Intersection"
設備比較工業簡約風，地理位置優越，附近赤峰街很好逛。,The equipment is relatively simple in industrial and excellent geographical location.
我住在這裡是因為它的位置便利，從機場搭乘巴士即可到達。之前住過大倉飯店，房間比我想像的大，乾淨。床很舒服，隔音也沒有想像中的問題。最大的問題是浴室門是玻璃的，頂部有一個開口，沒有隱私。除此之外，一切都令人滿意。,"I live here because of its convenient location and take a bus from the airport.I have lived in the Dacang Hotel before, and the room is larger than I thought.The bed is very comfortable, and there is no imaginative problem in sound insulation.The biggest problem is that the bathroom door is glass. There is a opening at the top without privacy.In addition, everything is satisfactory."
"乾淨，友好，一切都很合理👍
很高興您可以在附近租一輛自行車（YouBike）。","Clean, friendly, everything is reasonable 👍
I'm glad you can rent a bicycle nearby."
位置非常好，靠近幾個商業機構和商店以及吃飯的地方。距離地鐵站約 3 個街區，可通往世界貿易中心和 101 號樓等旅遊景點。是一種可以吃到下午的零食。服務非常好，幸運的是我有一個會說西班牙語的人。早上附近有一個公園，你可以看到居民在做運動，你可以看到典型的台灣房屋。去。,"The location is very good, close to several commercial institutions and stores and places to eat.About 3 blocks from the subway station can lead to tourist attractions such as the World Trade Center and Building 101.It is a snack that can be eaten in the afternoon.The service is very good. Fortunately, I have a person who can speak Spanish.There is a park near the morning. You can see that residents are doing exercise, and you can see a typical Taiwanese house.go."
定期住宿。這次我沒有工作去台灣進行私人旅行。房間是帶浴缸的豪華房型和只有淋浴間的合理型房型。它最初是作為隔壁著名的大使酒店的合理版本而建造的。前台工作人員也會說日文。餐廳很一般，但可以品嚐到各種酒。地下BAR在當地有名嗎？氣氛很好，標準也很高。,"Regular accommodation.This time I did not work to Taiwan for private travel.The room is a luxurious room type with a bathtub and a reasonable type of room with a shower room.It was originally built as a reasonable version of the famous ambassador hotel next door.The front desk staff also speaks Japanese.The restaurant is very average, but you can taste various wines.Is the underground BAR famous in the local area?The atmosphere is good and the standard is high."
台北中上區的精品旅館。  在這裡待14晚進行隔離。房間雖小但很乾淨。  我的房間面對中山北路林木線。視野良好，自然陽光充足。  食物很好有很多選擇。  友善且樂於助人的員工。  會再次留在這裡。,"Boutique hotel in Zhonggen District, Taipei.Wait here for 14 nights.Although the room is small but very clean.My room is facing the forest line of Zhongshan North Road.The field of vision is good, and natural sunlight is sufficient.There are many choices for food.Friendly and helpful employees.Will stay here again."
"就在日航酒店旁。
每層樓都設有聊天空間，無論是團體會議或個人小吃都很方便。","Just next to the Japanese Airlines Hotel.
There is a chat space on each floor, which is convenient for group meetings or personal snacks."
飯店所處的地理位置相當不錯，走不長的距離就可以搭乘捷運或公車。附近有三越百貨，買東西還是比較方便的。 ||飯店樓下的美式餐廳很不錯，就是一個人吃的話沒辦法點很多菜。,"The geographical location of the hotel is quite good, and you can take the MRT or bus after a long distance.There are Sanyue Department Store nearby, and it is more convenient to buy things.|| The American restaurant downstairs is very good. If you eat it alone, you can't order a lot of dishes."
房間清潔ok. 附近食肆多。只係位置在兩個車站中間，還是有一些距離要行。,"The room is cleaned. There are many restaurants nearby.Only the position of the two stations is still there, and there are still some distance to go."
這次住的是3樓的房間，不過好像是從我訂的房間升級了，這點還是很感激的。這次我住了3晚。房間一如既往的好用，不缺房子！ |可能是因為深夜沒有到，所以得到了第一次說日語的工作人員的協助。已經成為了。 |有地方趕快去吧！當我告訴他們這一點時，他們在我寄放行李時為我叫了一輛計程車，還告訴了我位置，對此我表示讚賞。 ||這次是從松山機場搭計程車過來的，雖然出示了上次住的飯店卡，但發現雖然是在一條著名的街道上，但還是繞路了，所以我解釋說這是在地下。 |也許我只是運氣不好，但似乎很多人都看不懂飯店的名字，除非你用中文告訴它...,"This time I lived in the room on the third floor, but it seemed to be upgraded from the room I booked. This is still very grateful.I lived for 3 nights this time.The room is as easy to use as ever, there is no shortage of houses!| It may be because it was not arrived late at night, so I was assisted by the first -speaking staff.It has become.| Hurry up!When I told them this, they called me a taxi when I put my luggage, and told me the position, and I praised it.|| This time I took a taxi from Songshan Airport. Although I presented the hotel card I lived in the last time, I found that although it was on a famous street, I still detoured, so I explained that this was underground.| Maybe I'm just lucky, but it seems that many people can't understand the name of the hotel, unless you tell it in Chinese ..."
我要求一間面向主幹道且有林木線的房間。這也是飯店的賣點之一。在第一個不眠之夜之後，我發現這是一個錯誤。窗戶不是雙層玻璃。摩托車噪音無法被隔離。前台也無能為力，立刻從抽屜裡拿出了兩副耳塞。  幸運的是，第二天早上安排了換房，因為大部分房間都面向主幹道。,"I asked a room to face the main road and there is a forest line.This is also one of the selling points of the hotel.After the first night of sleep, I found that this was a mistake.The windows are not double glass.Motorcycle noise cannot be isolated.The front desk was powerless and immediately took out two earplugs out of the drawer.Fortunately, the next morning was arranged to change the house because most of the rooms were facing the main road."
"交通便利，住宿乾淨。
最好的早餐。
品種多樣、新鮮。不是台灣菜不好，而是早餐最好吃… 👍 …","Convenient transportation and clean accommodation.
The best breakfast.
Various varieties and fresh.It's not that Taiwanese dishes are not good, but breakfast is the best ... 👍 ..."
"偉大的融合點。
美味的食物、美酒、優質的服務和良好的氛圍。
份量很小，所以你可以嘗試各種菜餚，這是一個優點。
有點貴但仍然合理。
噢，甜點也很美味！","Great fusion point.
Delicious food, wine, high -quality service and good atmosphere.
The portion is small, so you can try various dishes, which is an advantage.
A bit expensive but still reasonable.
Oh, desserts are also delicious!"
我訂的是大房間，房間寬敞、乾淨、漂亮。離中山站不太遠，適合步行。不過早餐沒有其他飯店好，而且窗戶很大，下雨的時候可以聽到雨打窗戶的聲音，所以比較吵。,"I booked a large room, the room is spacious, clean, and beautiful.Not too far from Zhongshan Station, suitable for walking.However, there are no other restaurants for breakfast, and the windows are very large. You can hear the sound of rain when it is raining, so it is more noisy."
我推薦黑麥麵包、南瓜餛飩、軟殼蟹和伊比利豬排。我們的頂蓋煮得恰到好處，只是外面燒焦了——儘管我仍然不推薦它，因為牛肉質量非常平庸。我們花了大約2500/人9道菜和2杯酒。避免將泡芙當作甜點。它們嘗起來就像是前一天的剩菜。,"I recommend rye bread, pumpkin ravioli, soft shell crab and Ibilia pork chop.Our top cover is just right, but it is burnt outside -although I still don't recommend it because the quality of beef is very mediocre.We spent about 2500/person 9 dishes and 2 glasses of wine.Avoid puff as desserts.They tasted like leftovers the day before."
我已經計劃了很長時間，並預訂了2月底至3月期間不允許取消的便宜計劃。 |然而，由於目前冠狀病毒的爆發，我不得不放棄這次旅行本身。由於這是不可取消的預訂，我原本以為不會退款，所以我給預訂台發了電子郵件，看看是否有什麼可以做的。 |然後我收到了兩個回复，說他們會用這個預訂作為下次的押金。 |全額。 |非常感謝您非常慷慨的回覆。下次我來訪時，我想住在 amba 並回顧這是一家多麼棒的酒店。 |謝謝你，安德里亞！,我已經計劃了很長時間，並預訂了2月底至3月期間不允許取消的便宜計劃。 |然而，由於目前冠狀病毒的爆發，我不得不放棄這次旅行本身。由於這是不可取消的預訂，我原本以為不會退款，所以我給預訂台發了電子郵件，看看是否有什麼可以做的。 |然後我收到了兩個回复，說他們會用這個預訂作為下次的押金。 |全額。 |非常感謝您非常慷慨的回覆。下次我來訪時，我想住在 amba 並回顧這是一家多麼棒的酒店。 |謝謝你，安德里亞！
"很乾淨，有會說韓語的工作人員。
早餐種類不多，但每天都略有變化，而且比基本的還多。
大堂雖然狹窄，但每層都有一個大廳，彌補了缺點。

位置距離中山站不到10分鐘，雖然週邊是辦公區，但氣氛與延南洞類似。

附近也有很多餐館，所以用餐選擇很豐富。

飯店內的 Buttermilk Restaurant 餐廳也是當地頗受歡迎的餐廳，供應午餐和晚餐。

住宿期間進行了當地廣播的拍攝。","Very clean, some staff who can speak Korean.
There are not many types of breakfast, but slightly changes every day, and more than basic.
Although the lobby is narrow, there is a hall on each floor, which makes up for the shortcomings.

The location is less than 10 minutes from Zhongshan Station. Although the surrounding office area is around, the atmosphere is similar to Yannan Cave.

There are also many restaurants nearby, so the choice of dining is rich.

The Buttermilk Restaurant restaurant in the hotel is also a popular restaurant in the local area, providing lunch and dinner.

During the accommodation, local radio shooting was performed."
飯店離馬偕醫院很近附近是繁榮的鬧區有很多賣衣服的商店尤其年輕女裝很多周末還會有一個市集價格不貴對於預算有限的情侶是不錯的選擇,The restaurant is very near the Mada Hospital. There are many shops selling clothes. There are many shops selling clothes. Especially young women's clothing will have a good market price for many weekends. It is a good choice for couples with limited budgets.
由於是新開的，所以很乾淨，內部裝潢也很現代，很不錯。 ||距離中山站約5-10分鐘，回程時前方就有機場巴士站，很方便。 ||酒店附近比較安靜，街對面有咖啡廳小巷。 ||不過遺憾的是早餐品種不多，味道也不是很好。我吃了三天一樣的東西，這讓我很渴。而且衛生間隔音不太好。是拉門，但是沒有鎖，而且距離床太近，有點尷尬。,"Because it is newly opened, it is very clean, the interior decoration is very modern and very good.|| It is about 5-10 minutes from Zhongshan Station. There is an airport bus station ahead at the return journey, which is very convenient.|| The hotel is relatively quiet, there are cafe alleys across the street.|| But unfortunately, there are not many breakfast varieties, and the taste is not very good.I ate the same thing for three days, which made me very thirsty.And the toilet sound insulation is not very good.It is a sliding door, but there is no lock, and the bed is too close to the bed, a little embarrassing."
接待處的日文還可以。距離捷運中山站有一段步行路程，但位於主幹道上，所以即使在晚上也是一個安全的位置。房間很乾淨，盥洗用品（人字拖、洗髮精（Konshin Hishin））也是經過精心挑選的。我想再次入住。,接待處的日文還可以。距離捷運中山站有一段步行路程，但位於主幹道上，所以即使在晚上也是一個安全的位置。房間很乾淨，盥洗用品（人字拖、洗髮精（Konshin Hishin））也是經過精心挑選的。我想再次入住。
"工作人員的反應非常好。
我覺得他們真誠地試圖提供幫助，所有的員工都非常友好，我不能說誰是最友好的。
工作人員能說流利的韓語和英語，所以在我入住期間沒有任何不便。
房間的內部現代而乾淨，我特別喜歡床上用品。
唯一的缺點是百葉窗升降有點不方便，因為我擔心看到窗外的房間，但我覺得大窗戶是這家旅館的一大優點。","The staff's response is very good.
I think they are sincere to provide help. All employees are very friendly. I can't say who is the most friendly.
The staff can speak fluent Korean and English, so there is no inconvenience during my stay.
The interior of the room is modern and clean. I especially like bedding.
The only disadvantage is that it is a bit inconvenient to rise by the louver, because I worry about seeing the room outside the window, but I think large windows are a major advantage of this hotel."
禮賓部和前台的服務都非常好，絕對友好且稱職的服務。強烈建議包含早餐的餐廳。舒適的客房設有窗戶，不幸的是太小並且無法打開。,"The service of the Libin Department and the front desk are very good, absolutely friendly and competent services.It is strongly recommended to include breakfast restaurants.The comfortable rooms have windows, unfortunately too small and unable to open."
飯店地點超棒。 5分鐘步行就能走到中山潮人購物及cafe地點。 ||員工服務非常親切及專業。飯店還能洗衣服，免去回家再處理一大堆骯髒衣服的煩惱。 ||房間也舒服。地點好，絕對滿意！,飯店地點超棒。 5分鐘步行就能走到中山潮人購物及cafe地點。 ||員工服務非常親切及專業。飯店還能洗衣服，免去回家再處理一大堆骯髒衣服的煩惱。 ||房間也舒服。地點好，絕對滿意！
2018 年 9 月，我們在中山意捨酒店住了 4 晚，每晚約 100 歐元。我們注意到以下幾點：||- 整體正面印象||- 非常友善的工作人員；有些人英語說得很好||- 酒店的精品風格||- 乾淨整潔||- 房間裡的存儲空間很小||- 小桌子||- 帶水淋浴的日式廁所!!||- 一部分浴室融入臥室| |- 美式餐廳「Buttermilk」和夜間酒吧「Mud」是房子的一部分（適合睡前小酌）。,"In September 2018, we stayed at the hotel in Zhongshan 4 nights for about 100 euros per night.We noticed the following points: ||-The overall positive impression ||-Very friendly staff; some people speak well in English ||-Hotel's boutique style ||-clean and tidy ||-The storage space in the room is very Small ||-Small table ||-Japanese-style toilets with water shower !! ||-Some bathrooms are integrated into the bedroom | |-American restaurant ""Buttermilk"" and night bar ""MUD"" are part of the house (suitable for bedtime) Essence"
大廳有點多蚊，公共空間地方很大，地理位置方便。 It is really not very bad hotel in Taipei.,"The lobby is a bit mosquito, the public space is very large, and the geographical location is convenient.It is Really Not Very Bad Hotel in TAIPEI."
"這是我第五次在台灣隔離，房間可以再大一些，但是你需要的一切都有，非常乾淨，不像這裡的其他五星級飯店。
毫無疑問，歐盟標準，如果你從外面訂購一些東西，你會在到達時得到並且是熱的:)。
下次我還會選擇安巴酒店。","這是我第五次在台灣隔離，房間可以再大一些，但是你需要的一切都有，非常乾淨，不像這裡的其他五星級飯店。

沒想像中好整體感覺也有點像青年旅社風格想要舒適高級感的可能不能選擇這,"I do n’t think of good overall feeling, it ’s a bit like the style of the youth hostel. Those who want to be comfortable and high -level may not be able to choose this."
飯店所在的街道安靜、乾淨。工作人員很友好，樂於助人，因為有會說韓語的工作人員。  有的女員工只會白天說韓語，晚上不會說韓語。內部很簡單，出水也很好。  早餐很普通。  距離中三站大概500-600米，需要走一段路。整體滿意,飯店所在的街道安靜、乾淨。工作人員很友好，樂於助人，因為有會說韓語的工作人員。  有的女員工只會白天說韓語，晚上不會說韓語。內部很簡單，出水也很好。  早餐很普通。  距離中三站大概500-600米，需要走一段路。整體滿意
"我在台北最好的酒店。該建築是一座老建築翻新而成，古樸而現代。簡約的設施和客戶服務減輕了客人和主人的壓力，讓他們享受輕鬆愉快的住宿。
地板是由一種看起來像緊密編織的亞麻布的材料（樹脂？）製成的，我想知道這是否是感覺不到酒店常見的灰塵和污垢的秘訣。

據說店主是附近著名飯店「Ambassador」的家族成員。這就是為什麼名字叫「安巴」。","I am the best hotel in Taipei.The building is renovated by an old building, simple and modern.Simple facilities and customer services have reduced the pressure of guests and masters, allowing them to enjoy a relaxed accommodation.
The floor is made of a material (resin?) That looks like a tightly weaving linen. I want to know if this is the secret of not feeling the common dust and dirt in the hotel.

It is said that the owner is a family member of the well -known restaurant ""Ambassador"".This is why the name is ""Anba""."
"小酒店的設計很獨特，很有藝術感。
每個房間都有自己獨特的設計。
非常適合住宿，而且可以更方便地前往台北的大部分標誌性地點。","The design of the small hotel is unique and artistic.
Each room has its own unique design.
It is very suitable for accommodation, and it is more convenient to go to most of the iconic locations in Taipei."
優越的地理位置，出色的友好和快速的服務，美麗的房間，美麗的景色。每當我們在台北時，我們都會去酒店,優越的地理位置，出色的友好和快速的服務，美麗的房間，美麗的景色。每當我們在台北時，我們都會去酒店
房間乾淨舒適，工作人員很友善。對免費的自助早餐感到驚訝。不過位置離地鐵站有點遠，步行約10分鐘。酒店附近有購物中心和餐廳。還有一些不錯的咖啡館和咖啡店。,"The room is clean and comfortable, and the staff is very friendly.Surprised to free buffet breakfast.However, the location is a bit far from the subway station, walking for about 10 minutes.There are shopping malls and restaurants near the hotel.There are some good cafes and coffee shops."
這間附露台的客房可供3人入住。首先，前台工作人員很友好，房間雖小，但乾淨而現代。離地鐵站有點遠，要走一段路，但周圍很安靜，乾淨。  夜市也在步行距離之內，第一次去台灣很滿意。,"This room with a terrace is available for 3 people.First of all, the front desk staff is very friendly. Although the room is small, it is clean and modern.It is a bit far from the subway station. I have to go for a while, but the surroundings are very quiet and clean.The night market is also within the walking distance, and is very satisfied for the first time to go to Taiwan."
我對簡單而乾淨的房間以及友好的接待和服務感到滿意。整體來說，內裝有一種年輕的感覺，床品特別舒服。附近有便利商店和餐廳，包括韓國餐廳，靠近中山咖啡街、中山站、雙連站。   缺點是大廳比較小，風景也不是很好。,"I am satisfied with the simple and clean room and friendly reception and service.On the whole, the interior has a young feeling, and the bedding is particularly comfortable.There are convenience stores and restaurants nearby, including Korean restaurants, near Zhongshan Coffee Street, Zhongshan Station, and Shuanglian Station.The disadvantage is that the hall is relatively small, and the scenery is not very good."
"距離中山站步行10分鐘，距離雙連站步行5分鐘。距離便利商店步行1分鐘。現代實用的內裝。
不幸的是，早餐的種類很少。也許這就是它如此空虛的原因。而且，我在室內唯一可以放鬆的地方就是我的床上。我想要一張沙發，還是一張沙發。","距離中山站步行10分鐘，距離雙連站步行5分鐘。距離便利商店步行1分鐘。現代實用的內裝。

第二次入住，相隔幾天，換了一個房間，跟第一次一樣好、一樣安靜、一樣乾淨。工作人員非常專業和友好。飯店位於風景優美的地區，距離中正地鐵站步行10mm。,"For the second time, a few days apart, I changed a room, as good, quiet, and clean as the first time.The staff is very professional and friendly.The hotel is located in a beautiful area and walks 10mm from the Zhongzheng Metro Station."
離車站和市中心都很近，房間寬敞乾淨。早餐很美味而且種類很多！,離車站和市中心都很近，房間寬敞乾淨。早餐很美味而且種類很多！
這是我第四次來台北，也是第一次入住中山。這家飯店距離中三站步行5-7分鐘嗎？值得走一走，附近很安靜，工作人員也很友善。最重要的是，我喜歡這家飯店乾淨又時尚！他們還給我免費升等了房間。,"This is the fourth time I came to Taipei and the first time I stayed in Zhongshan.Is this restaurant walking for 5-7 minutes from the middle of three stations?It is worth walking, it is quiet nearby, and the staff is also very friendly.The most important thing is that I like this restaurant clean and fashionable!They also waited for the room for free."
中山站、上聯站均可到達，步行約5至10分鐘即可到達。特別是中山站旁邊有一個當地市場，從早上營業到中午，所以逛逛很有趣。 |大使飯店位於飯店旁邊，機場巴士停在前面的巴士站，出遊時請注意這一點。飯店一樓的餐廳（早上早餐，午餐餐廳）在當地人中頗有名氣，其時尚的內飾和美味的食物讓我休息得很好（菜餚似乎根據一天中的時間而變化） ）這是我想住的飯店。,"Both Zhongshan Station and Shanglian Station can be reached, and walk for about 5 to 10 minutes.In particular, there is a local market next to Zhongshan Station. It is interesting to shop from the morning to noon.| Ambassador Hotel is located next to the hotel. The airport bus stops at the bus stop in front. Please pay attention to this when traveling.The restaurant on the first floor of the restaurant (breakfast in the morning, lunch restaurant) is quite famous among the locals. Its fashionable interior and delicious food make me rest very well (the dishes seem to change according to the time of the day). This is me. The hotel you want to live."
我經常使用它。位置和房間設施都很完美。如果要寫一些困擾我的事情的話，暖氣壞了，不知為什麼沒有拖鞋，早餐時沙拉吧上有小蒼蠅。,"I often use it.The location and room facilities are perfect.If you want to write some things that bother me, the heating is broken. I do n’t know why there are no slippers. There are small flies on the salad bar on the breakfast."

"一個月前官網上訂2小床房,今天晚上7:30到酒店辦理入住, 給傷殘人士房間，即洗澡後浴室地板全濕的房, 非常不滿意! 然後要我加毎晚696台幣提升中房, 是騙案嗎？我並沒要求偒殘人士低層房!","One month ago, I booked 2 small bed rooms on the official website, and went to the hotel at 7:30 tonight to check in to the room where the disabled, that is, the room with a wet floor of the bathroom floor after bathing, very dissatisfied!

It is really convenient. You can wash the clothes worn that day and keep it soft!|| But people don't know the location, but you tell them that they are right next to the Binbin Hotel, they will know ~!"
乾淨又漂亮。步行到中山站大約7-8分鐘，沿途有很多漂亮的咖啡館，所以非常適合喝茶、咖啡或甜點。附近有一家百貨公司，但我沒有去，因為那裡似乎沒有什麼可供遊客購買的東西。,"Clean and beautiful.Walk to Zhongshan Station for about 7-8 minutes, and there are many beautiful cafes along the way, so it is very suitable for drinking tea, coffee or dessert.There is a department store nearby, but I didn't go because there seemed to be nothing to buy."

距離我退房已經9天了，那天你說押金取消了。我聯繫了銀行，他們說這筆交易沒有取消操作，存款仍然存在。

請在這件事上保持專業態度，因為我在離開酒店之前已與您確認過取消押金的事宜。","First of all, the accommodation experience is very good, but I do n’t agree with you to charge me a $ 2,000 deposit to go through the procedures for check -in.Too unexpectedly!Your website and Agoda did not explain this.What if I do not carry 2000TWD?

Please maintain a professional attitude in this matter, because I have confirmed to cancel the deposit with you before leaving the hotel."
是過夜的好地方。洗手間不是那麼乾淨,It is a good place for overnight.The toilet is not so clean
這是一家時尚的飯店。二樓設有投幣式洗衣機。飲水機和製冰機也位於投幣式洗衣機的相同位置。如果您從桃園機場前來，我們建議您搭乘國光巴士並在國賓大飯店下車。,這是一家時尚的飯店。二樓設有投幣式洗衣機。飲水機和製冰機也位於投幣式洗衣機的相同位置。如果您從桃園機場前來，我們建議您搭乘國光巴士並在國賓大飯店下車。

當我們十月在那裡的時候。一家非常好的酒店，房間非常新鮮，感覺就像一家可愛的酒店。房間裡有音樂系統是一個很大的優點，因為你可以在房間裡播放自己的音樂。房間外的公共空間是一個優點，因為你可以坐在那裡，放鬆地與朋友見面，但同時又感覺賓至如歸。 |非常好的飯店。工作人員很好，當我們想要雙人羽絨被時，我們在十分鐘內就得到了。,"When we were there in October.A very good hotel, the room is very fresh, it feels like a cute hotel.There is a great advantage in the music system in the room because you can play your own music in the room.The public space outside the room is an advantage, because you can sit there and meet your friends relaxing, but at the same time feel the guests.| Very good restaurant.The staff is very good.
