宏樹老闆服務很周到，廚藝也不錯。店裡位子不多，頂多10個人就滿了。小小一間店，麻雀雖小五臟俱全，想喝酒配點熱食，絕對不成問題。可刷卡。,"Hongshu boss service is very thoughtful, and the cooking skills are also good.There are not many seats in the store, at most 10 people are full.In a small shop, although the sparrows are small and the internal organs, if you want to drink with hot food, it is definitely not a problem.You can swipe your card.",False
一位日本大叔開的葡萄酒吧當然也有威士忌或一些簡單的調酒，環境空間舒適音音樂氣氛放鬆，老闆也很熱情為我們介紹酒，服務很到位。但價位偏高比較適合來品酒非豪飲。,"Of course, a bar bar opened by Japan also has whiskey or some simple bartending.

The service is in place.However, the price is highly suitable for drinking.",False
"很難路過，路過也不會留意，留意也不敢進去的一間日式小店

很難定義類型，空間很cozy，主要內容是喝紅白酒的酒吧，但又供應有精緻的特色餐點，配酒小點，蛋糕，更像是老闆的一個舒適招待客人小空間

可以輕鬆點單杯大概 400上下，紅白各一種，也可以幾個人點bottle來share(價格屬中高，2000+~5000+)","It's hard to pass by, I will not pay attention to passing by, and a Japanese -style shop that I dare not go in

It is difficult to define the type. The space is very cozy. The main content is to drink red and white wine bars, but it also provides exquisite special meals, with a small wine, cake, and more like a boss's comfortable entertaining guests.

You can easily order a single cup around 400, one red and white, or a few people can order bottle to share (the price is medium to high, 2000+~ 5000+))",False
非常喜歡這間酒吧，老闆是日本人，很用心的介紹每種酒，也會拿出私藏很厲害的紅白酒，整間店座位不多，可以很放鬆的跟朋友聊天，也可以直接認識新朋友！！好喜歡這裡，絕對會常來！！下次想試看看甜點😂 …,"I like this bar very much. The boss is a Japanese.

一杯500多的紅酒，說實在很一般，味道很淡+真的很小杯，不知道是不是太久沒回台灣，覺得物價有點貴😅 …,A cup of more than 500 red wine is really average. The taste is very light+really a small cup. I don't know if I haven't returned to Taiwan for too long.,False

"信義區巷弄裡的小酒吧。
店名Luana，是夏威夷語中輕鬆自在的意思，老闆是一位週遊列國的日本人，覺得在台灣紅酒酒吧的店比較少，選擇在信義區開店，希望能讓喜歡紅酒的人，能在舒適的空間品嚐美味的紅酒。

第一次嘗試甜點酒，葡萄味濃厚，喝起來像果汁，但千萬別輕忽酒精濃度而喝多，後勁頗強。
除了酒之外，也有老闆特製的料理，今天點的是夏威夷風味的漢堡排佐紅酒醬，漢堡裡有加豆腐，吃起來更鮮嫩多汁。

邊吃著漢堡排，啜飲葡萄酒，成熟的享受（笑）。

謝謝老闆陪我聊天，讓鮮少跟外國人交流的我、能有機會更認識嚮往的國家，渡過一個有趣的小周末，會再去光顧，認識更多不同的紅酒。","Bar in Lane Lane, Xinyi District.
The store name Luana is a relaxed and comfortable in Hawaii. The boss is a Japanese who travels around the country. I think there are fewer shops in the Taiwanese wine bar. I choose to open a store in Xinyi District. I hope that people who like red wine can be comfortable in comfortable wine. Space taste delicious red wine.

For the first time, I tried dessert wine. The grapes were strong and drinking like fruit juice, but do n’t neglect the concentration of wine and drink more.
In addition to wine, there are also special dishes made by the boss. Today, it is the Hawaiian -flavored burger. It has tofu in the burger, which is more tender and juicy.

Eat the burger row, sip the wine, mature enjoyment (laughs).

"優質的服務，安靜的地方，優質的葡萄酒，但杯裝的選擇很少，甚至不能提前嘗試。對於你所得到的來說，價格太高了。一小杯酒近600新台幣，一小份起司近800新台幣。
