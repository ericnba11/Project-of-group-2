"菜好吃，有別於時時香跟1010湘
有點綜合台菜、川菜與湘菜
環境不錯，桌與桌的距離也抓得適中，不會太擠
水要另外買、而且不便宜，建議可以照人頭收水資，不然都是重口味的菜，會渴
滷肉是出乎意料的好吃，肥瘦適中也很入味
特別推薦醋嫩薑松阪豬，其他的菜都算是符合水準的表現。
推薦再訪。","The dishes are delicious, different from timely incense and 1010 Xiang
A little comprehensive Taiwanese, Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine
The environment is good, the distance between the table and the table is also moderately grasped, it will not be too crowded
Water should be bought separately, and it is not cheap. It is recommended
Braised meat is unexpectedly delicious, fat and thin are also very delicious
It is especially recommended for vinegar and tender ginger pine pigs. Other dishes are considered to be in line.
Recommended visit."
服務人員服務很好，餐點好吃，餐點稍微偏鹹一些些，但配飯很好吃，白飯不小心吃了好多碗。推薦鮑魚滷肉飯好吃，可惜沒有單純的滷肉飯可以單點，這是一家值得品嚐看看的瓦城體系新品牌。,"The service staff service is very good, the meal is delicious, the meal is slightly salty, but the rice is delicious, and the rice accidentally ate a lot of bowls.It is recommended that abalone braised pork rice is delicious. Unfortunately, there is no simple braised pork rice to order. This is a new brand of Wacheng system worthy of tasting."
"第一次來‘’小香‘’用餐，
餐廳里穿西裝的服務人員帶位的pinky美眉介紹菜單，很耐心又仔細，
Lucy美女和furby妹妹服務的很周到，用餐期間常來關心我們口味是否適合。
今天我和女兒生日聚餐，非常溫馨愉快🩷
以後要常常邀請朋來餐聚🍹","The first time I came to ‘’ Xiaoxiang ‘’ dinner,
The Pinky Meimei Introduction menu wearing a suit personnel in the restaurant is very patient and careful.
Lucy beauty and Furby sister serve very thoughtful. During the meal, we often care about whether our taste is suitable.
Today, my daughter and I have a birthday dinner, very warm and happy 🩷
In the future, I will often invite friends to come and gather"
服務滿分💯桌菜的部分很推薦，招牌菜色都在裡面～鮑魚滷肉飯真的好吃😋蒸蛋松露味道濃郁、松阪豬涼拌很清爽，鮮蝦捲超級juicy~,"Part of the service full -scale table dishes is recommended. The signature dishes are all in it ~ abalone braised pork rice is really delicious. 😋 Steamed egg truffle flavor, Matsusaka pig cold mixing is very refreshing, fresh shrimp rolls are super juicy ~"
"剛開幕還在試營運階段就降到4.2顆星真的太快，表示要好好正視一下客人的體驗感受。

因為自己提前先到，入座後不會主動上水，要了才有反應，後來到齊後，菜都點完了，也聊一陣子，其他朋友的也沒主動給水。如果是想要客人點飲品，我們也有點，但水杯空了還是不會來主動補，看來是沒有這樣的教育訓練，水是多珍貴？

上菜速度超快，我們已經是六人座，桌子還能瞬間被塞滿，完全沒在管客人速度，還是週一的午餐，餐廳內沒幾桌客人⋯吃起來手忙腳亂的！

菜色都在水準，整體偏重口味，有些死鹹，乾扁四季豆過油，烏魚子炒飯要是沒烏魚子完全沒鹹度及香氣，這兩道不推，剝皮辣椒湯偏甜，沒幾口就膩，有點跟平常喝的不同自己不是很愛。

香煎虱目魚好吃，魚嫩度剛好不柴，上面灑了鍋巴米香口感變得豐富有趣。醋嫩薑松阪豬蠻開胃的，黑松露鮮蝦蒸蛋，松露味道香氣夠，鮮蝦是剁成碎末狀，3.5杯雞記得稍微在拌一下才會有酒的香氣～B咖排骨很好吃，用咖啡跟巧克力去調味非常的玩味，吃起來也意外好吃，很推。

飲品很喜歡烏龍氣泡飲，因為整體口味偏置，這杯可以很解膩非常清爽，甘蔗青茶甘蔗香氣不足整體非常甜膩，沒有青茶味。

整體還是覺得不錯，試營運人少所以還是很舒適，但基本的服務真的非常需要加強，員工的表情也沒像評論說的沒有在管理，只是比較被動。","It was too fast to fall to 4.2 stars at the trial operation stage, indicating that you should face up to the guest's experience.

Because I arrived in advance, I would not take the initiative to get the water after I entered the seat. I had to react after it was required. Later, when I arrived, the vegetables were all ordered. For a while, other friends did not take the initiative to give the water.If you want guests to order drinks, we are also a bit, but when the water cup is empty, we will not take the initiative to make up. It seems that there is no such education and training. How precious the water is?

The speed of serving is very fast. We are already six -seater. The table can be stuffed instantly. It is not controlled by the guest speed at all. It is still on Monday's lunch. There are few guests in the restaurant.

The dishes are at the level, the overall taste is focused, some are dead and salty, dried and flat seasons of soybean oil, murmons fried rice, if there is no mulleton, there is no salty and aroma, these two do not push, peeling pepper soup is sweet, and there will be a few mouthfuls. Fervable, a bit different from the usual difference, I don't love it very much.

The fried milkfish is delicious, the tenderness of the fish is just not firewood, and the taste of the pot is rich and interesting.The vinegar tender ginger pine pig is pretty appetizer, black loose fresh shrimp steamed eggs, and the flavor of truffle is enough. The shrimp is chopped into a broken last, and 3.5 cups of chickens remember to mix a little. Eat, use coffee and chocolate to season it, it is very funny, it is unexpectedly delicious and pushed.

Drinks like oolong bubbles, because of the overall taste bias, this cup can be very greasy and refreshing. The sugarcane green tea sugarcane aroma is not enough to be very sweet, and there is no green tea flavor.

I still feel good as a whole. It is still very comfortable to test operators, but the basic services really need to be strengthened. The expression of employees is not as managed as comments, but it is more passive."
"2024.05.30

非常開心也感謝瓦城邀請會員品嚐新餐廳，新菜色！
當天剛用完餐，就想要寫評論
但是礙於找不到地標
所以到今天才把當時用餐的感受寫下來

虎皮鮮蝦捲：非常薄的外衣，顯得不油膩，內餡蝦味濃郁。真的很不錯。

腐乳空心菜：菜品鮮嫩，調味恰到好處

松露蒸蛋：蛋本身已經有調味，上面的松露肉燥過鹹，這一道吃起來有點太重口

3.5杯雞：這道完全恰到好處，連米血糕都好吃到不行😄

香煎虱目魚：魚上面的炸米，完全讓這道菜來到一個新境界，這樣的口感非常好，很特別！👍

醋嫩薑松阪豬：這道有點酸，吃多了會有點太酸，火侯掌握的也不錯

鮑魚滷肉飯：肉燥還不錯，但是給的非常少，然後擺盤出來有點隨便，肉燥跟鮑魚放兩邊，感覺視覺很不集中，可惜了！

用餐心得的感受：餐點不錯，搭配的烏龍茶，味道清新，也非常的恰到好處，就是餐廳的位置有一些擁擠，可能是為了市場考量，要這樣子的來客數才能夠營運一家餐廳。

但是如果是以喝酒吃飯的場合來講有點擁擠。
會顯得比較吵雜
但是整體來講，服務很不錯。
是值得一訪的餐廳","2024.05.30

I am very happy and thank Wacheng for inviting members to taste new restaurants, new dishes!
I just finished the meal that day, I want to write a comment
But because it can't find the landmark
That's why I will write down the feelings of the meal at that time

Tiger skin fresh shrimp rolls: Very thin coat, it looks greasy, the filling shrimp taste is strong.It's really good.

Ferdfered cabbage: the dishes are tender and seasoned just right

Tulu steamed eggs: The egg itself has flavored, the truffle meat on it is too salty, and this taste is a bit too heavy.

3.5 cup of chicken: This is exactly right, even rice blood cakes are delicious.

Crystal milkfish: The fried rice on the fish completely allows this dish to come to a new realm. This taste is very good, very special!Bleak

Vinegar tender ginger pine pig: This is a bit sour. If you eat too much, it will be a bit sour.

Abalone braised pork rice: The meat is not bad, but it is very small, and then it is a bit casual. The meat is dry and the abalone is put on both sides. The vision is very unimplexing, but unfortunately!

Feelings of dining: The meal is good, the mating oolong tea, the taste is fresh, and it is very just right. The location of the restaurant has some crowded. It may be for market considerations. The number of visitors in this way can operate a restaurant.

But if you are drinking for drinking and eating, a bit crowded.
Will look more noisy
But overall, the service is very good.
It is a restaurant worth visiting"
口味很好吃，算是創意臺菜。像是鮑魚滷肉飯真的很鮮美，臘肉高麗菜也真的很棒。但是桌邊服務太頻繁，還在喝湯，湯匙就被收走。,"The taste is delicious, and it is a creative Taiwanese dish.Like abalone braised pork rice is really delicious, and the bacon cabbage is really great.However, the service on the table is too frequent, and it is still drinking soup, and the spoon is taken away."
"第一次來覺得冷氣超冷 第二次也是 直接到冰宮的感覺 菜色的部分都徧油和鹹 還有一道薑絲大腸 我們反應大腸太硬且有腥味也只回答 喔…..  沒有多作解釋 新的品牌想做一點新的變化可以了解 但員工訓練大有問題 還有很多人提到水的問題 他們只有提供付費的礦泉水或是氣泡水，沒有免費的一般水 。 上菜的速度很快 肚子餓的人很適合 但人還沒到齊就拼命上菜 應該詢問客人速度是否需要緩緩 也沒有問 是我們告訴服務人員先停下來 我們人還沒到齊
適合喜歡重鹹重口味的人 對於自製的辣油在上菜的時候根本沒提 所以根本不知道它的存在 雖然有看到它並不知道是自製的 否則應該會品嚐一下 烏龍氣泡飲 很好喝
甜點杏仁豆腐沒拍照 也是徧甜 沒有什麼杏仁味 加了鳳梨味道更甜 不推薦","For the first time, I felt that the cool and cold air -conditioned and the second time I went directly to the ice palace. To explain that the new brand wants to make a new change, you can understand, but there are many problems with employee training. Many people mentioned water problems. They only provide paid mineral water or bubble water. There is no free general water.People who are hungry quickly are very suitable for people who are hungry, but they are desperate to ask the guests if they have not arrived.
Suitable for people who like salty taste for self -made spicy oil at all when they are serving, so I don’t know that it exists, although I see it and I do n’t know it is self -made
Dessert almond tofu does not take pictures, it is sweet, there is no almond flavor, the pineapple flavor is sweeter and the sweet is not recommended"
"2024/09/28 晚餐內用

用餐限時90分鐘，水費另計，白飯沒有吃到飽，上菜速度挺快

鮑魚滷肉飯，吃過一次即可，甚至一桌點一碗試試味道，不會想再點第二次。

菜色部分如同其他評論所說，像瓦城其他品牌綜合體，然後價格再拉高。

我們點了咖啡排骨、豬頸肉那道、豬血糕牛那道、鱈魚那道、土豆絲、松露蛋、麻婆豆腐，還有湯，跟腐皮卷蝦那個。

整體而言，沒什麼太大記憶點，唯一記得就是sherry很可愛，還有另一個也是挺漂亮的。

Ting and Stanley服務態度挺好，story相當客氣，至於食物好像就吃過，就喔喔喔喔，沒了。","2024/09/28 Dinner for dinner

The meal is limited to 90 minutes, and the water cost is separated. The rice is not full, and the food is quite fast.

Abalone braised meat rice, you can eat it once, or even order a bowl of a bowl of try, and you will not want to order it again.

The dish part, as other comments, is like other brand complexes in Wacheng, and then the price is raised.

We ordered coffee ribs, pork neck meat, pork blood cake beef, cod, potato shreds, truffle eggs, Mapo tofu, soup, and rotten rolling shrimp.

Overall, there is no big memory point. The only thing to remember is that Sherry is very cute, and the other is also very beautiful.

Ting and Stanley's service attitude is very good, Story is quite polite. As it seems to have eaten food, oh oh, no."

"2021/06/09 初訪

白飯沒有人頭吃到飽，建議調頭去吃時時香，因為這裡店員臉很臭，主管臉更臭。入坐都上菜了還沒水，要了兩次才給，後續也沒主動詢問補水，這樣服務費好意思收10%？

本來懶得寫評論，所以菜色也不想拍，結果服務爛到嚇人，不寫不行。

跟瓦城其他品牌的最大差異「白飯沒有吃到飽」。

🔴推薦餐：香煎虱目魚、主廚自製辣油
🟠環境：乾淨、寬敞
🟡服務：超爛
🟢價格：高價位
🔵付款方式：刷卡
🟣優惠：開幕下次送炒飯

沒吃過瓦城集團有這麼爛服務的店！

帶位上來沒主動給水，菜都上了還沒水，要了兩次過5分鐘才給。

店員臉都很臭，穿西裝的應該是主管臉最臭，甚至看她幫其他客人送完水之後翻白眼？

還有水都喝完了，也沒有半次主動來問要不要補水，這種爛服務憑什麼收10%服務費啊？

一家全新的店，應該9成以上客人都沒吃過吧？結果沒主動介紹菜色，只講酒水優惠？滿頭問號。

------餐點------

虎皮鮮蝦捲：普通，吃起來就像外表變腐皮去炸的蝦餅，不用點。

👍香煎虱目魚：超級好吃必點，魚肉肥嫩適中魚肚香濃，酥炸程度剛剛好外脆內軟，加上上面的米香粒很好吃！

👍香香阿嬤紅燒肉：下飯偏甜好吃可以點，但跟時時香的阿婆紅燒肉一樣，兩顆對半切的蛋、紅燒肉、花生、豆乾入菜。

九孔鮑魚滷肉飯：超普通，但是必點，原因是因為，他會給你一罐「主廚自製辣油」👍🌶️超好吃！拌飯拌菜好吃極無敵讚，辣油味濃郁不膩。

👎白飯：台灣越光米，吃起來普通沒有香，口感還不錯。
不過一碗要30元還卻沒裝滿？太小氣了吧。

——————

建議去吃時時香就好了，反正許多菜色口味價格差不多，還能白飯吃到飽。

給星標準：

一星：超雷，沒來吃過的就不要來吃，不會回訪。

There is no one who is full of rice in the rice rice. It is recommended to take a head to eat, because the clerk's face is stinky here, and the supervisor's face is even more smelly.I did n’t get water after entering the meals. It was required to be given twice, and I did n’t take the initiative to ask the water to replenish the water. So the service fee is good at collecting 10%?

I was too lazy to write comments, so the dishes did not want to shoot. As a result, the service was scary and could not be written.

The biggest difference from other brands of Wacheng, ""The rice is not full.""

虱 Recommended meals: fried milkfish, chef self -made spicy oil
宽 Environment: clean, spacious
🟡 Service: Super bad
🟢 Price: high price
刷 Payment method: credit card
次 Preferent

I have never eaten such a bad service shop in Wacheng Group!

I did n’t take the initiative to give the water, and the vegetables were not yet water. It took 5 minutes to give it twice.

The clerk's face was very stinky. It should be the most stinky face in a suit. Even after seeing her helping other guests after sending water?

There are still water, and I did n’t take the initiative to ask if I want to replenish water for half a time. Why does this rotten service charge 10%of the service fee?

A brand new store should not have eaten more than 90 % of the guests, right?As a result, I did not take the initiative to introduce the dishes. I only talked about wine discounts?A question mark.

------ Meal -------

Tiger skin fresh shrimp rolls: ordinary, it tastes like a shrimp cake that turns rotten skin to fry, no need to order.

： 👍 👍 👍 👍: Super delicious food must be ordered.

烧 👍 嬷 嬷 👍 👍 👍: The meal is sweet and delicious, but like Shi Xiang's grandparent red roast meat, two pairs of half -cut eggs, braised pork, peanuts, and dried beans into dishes.

Jiu Kong abalone braised meat rice: Super ordinary, but it must be ordered, because he will give you a can of ""chef's homemade spicy oil"" 👍🌶️ Super delicious!Bibimbap is delicious and invincible, and the spicy oil taste is rich and not greasy.

米 👎 👎: Taiwan Yueguang rice, there is no fragrance to taste, and the taste is not bad.
But it costs 30 yuan for a bowl, but isn't it full?It's too stingy.

——————————

It is recommended to eat it from time to time. Anyway, many dishes are about the same price, and you can eat it.

—————————————————————————————
Strike standard:

One star: Super Thunder, don't eat if you haven't eaten it, you will not return to visit.

Two stars: I don't expect it. Most of the environmental quality is not good. Those who like similar items can be eaten and will not return to visit.

Samsung: Ordinary, personal taste issues, high or expensive items are high or expensive, tourists can eat or return to visit.

Four stars: Most of the items are delicious, and some are in some places in some places in the price or environment.

Five -star: Very delicious, the taste quality environment is satisfactory, and it will visit the area for the restaurant.

"簡單吃個飯 菜色不錯 環境衛生
收盤太快讓我感覺是翻桌率很高的熱炒店","Simply eat a meal, good environmental sanitation
The closing is too fast to make me feel like a hot stir -fry shop with a high table of turning the table"
"嘗試打造新風格的台菜市場
但員工的配套訓練卻是有落差
在推銷菜色、酒品這一塊非常積極，但因為不提供飲水，等同半強迫點飲料
而在細緻的服務上，還有很大改進空間
例如，因為各道菜很快上桌，但桌上空間有限，因此詢問服務生能否協助將三盤剩一半的菜換小盤，但服務生送回來卻是用三個碗盛裝。我們不知道，服務生自己知不知道習俗中，什麼時候才會用菜碗？後來又跟服務生索取三個小碟，把菜更換過來。
而最後，在我們還沒用完餐，只是在聊天時，服務生又過來說，我幫你們整理桌面，我們還未同意，她就逕行疊盤，卻沒注意到盤中還有牛肉塊。當我們反應時，服務生只是傻傻看著我們，我們也只能苦笑。
期待，未來還能有所期待","Try to create a new style of Taiwan cuisine market
But there is a gap in the supporting training of employees
It is very positive to sell dishes and wines, but because it does not provide drinking water, it is equivalent to half -forced drinking
In terms of meticulous service, there is still a lot of room for improvement
For example, because the various dishes are on the table quickly, but the table space is limited, I asked whether the waiter could assist in the exchange of half of the three dishes remaining, but the waiter returned with three bowls of costumes.We don't know when the waiter knows in the customs, when will it use a vegetable bowl?Later, he asked the waiter for three small dishes and replaced the dishes.
In the end, when we had not finished meals, just when we were chatting, the waiter came over again. I helped you to organize the desktop. Before we agreed, she stacked the disk, but did not notice that there were beef pieces in the plate.When we respond, the waiter just looked at us stupidly, and we could only smile bitterly.
Looking forward to it, you can still look forward to it in the future"

"第一次來到香香,非常驚喜,很開心有新的台菜的餐廳開幕,今天是第二次來訪,點了與第一次不同的菜,也是非常開心喜歡吃,我想這家店我常常拜訪。推薦他們的鮑魚滷肉飯,烏魚子炒飯也好吃,還有虱目魚,麻婆豆腐等等,都非常好吃。推薦給大家必要來訪的餐廳。","When I came to Xiangxiang for the first time, I was very surprised. I was very happy to open the restaurant with new Taiwanese cuisine. Today is the second visit. I ordered different dishes from the first time. I am also very happy to eat. I think this shop I often visit.Recommended their abalone braised meat rice, mulberry fried rice is also delicious, and milkfish, Mapo tofu, etc., are very delicious.Recommended to the restaurants for everyone."
第一次嘗試瓦城集團旗下的香香新臺菜，整體而言味道很不錯，每道菜都有驚艷到，但是整體而言，餐點有點偏油，如果牙口不好的，可以避開醋嫩薑松阪豬，有幾塊會咬不動，黑松露鮮蝦蒸蛋超級下飯，香煎虱目魚有放上蔥油，但如果蔥油的部份在瀝掉一點油會更好，豆花很香很嫩，可以來試看看,"For the first time, I tried the Xiangxiang New Terrace of Wacheng Group. The overall taste is very good. Each dish is amazing, but overall, the meal is a bit oily. If the mouth is not good, you can avoid vinegar. Tender ginger pine pigs, there are a few pieces that can not be bitten, black pine fresh shrimp steamed eggs are super rice, fried milkfish with green onion oil, but if the onion oil part is drained a little oil, it will be better. The fragrance is very tender, you can try it"
"沒有主動提供白開水..但要了會給…..加水是將杯子取走 加滿後送回 差點被分到友人有口紅印那杯

整體菜色偏鹹*個人算稍重口味

主打的鮑魚滷肉飯 另人失望（九孔很小一個 其他跟坊間滷肉飯無區別 甚至…以這單價來說有些後悔點了這道招牌菜）

嫩薑松阪豬的豬肉有股腥味

腐乳空心菜鹹到一口就不想再吃了

豬血糕牛肉粒那道菜值得推薦

咖啡肋排也不錯

松露蒸蛋也不錯

約了朋友一起吃飯 感覺有點沒面子

Ps:
現場主管 嗯 就是您…不認為您有誠意*至少每桌誠意不同（我們旁邊兩人桌 他們在反應問題後有了不錯的待遇 看到您在解釋那道菜沒收錢….跟我們這桌的口頭慰問有很大的落差 ） 解決客訴….","I did not take the initiative to provide boiled water ... but I will give it to ... add water to take away the cup and send it back to the friend with a lipstick.

The overall dishes are salty*individual is a little heavy taste

The main abalone braised pork rice is also disappointed (Jiu Kong is very small, one other is no different from the braised meat rice in the room, or even ... In this unit price, some regret or order this signature dish)

The pork of the tender Jiangsaka pig has a fishy smell

I do n’t want to eat it anymore

Pig blood cake and beef grain that is worth recommending

Coffee ribs are also good

Tulu steamed eggs are also good

I got a friend to eat together and feel a bit faceless

Ps:
The on -site supervisor is you ... don't think you have sincerity*at least each table is different (the two people next to us have a good treatment after the response problem. There is a big gap in oral condolences) to solve the customer complaint ..."
"第一份餐點上，鍋蓋打開就放著⋯飯點了四碗過五分鐘才上，冷氣爆炸冷，熱菜都變成冷麻婆豆腐。
四個人必須要點到六碗飯180元白飯才可以將口味重的五道菜吃完～
不提供水，會期待顧客要點飲品，所以我們點了一瓶氣泡水，日本雖然會期待顧客點飲品但要求水還是會很客氣送上，我們的結論是如果中場沒有休息那可以帶著笑臉服務嗎？這餐廳到底怎麼一回事？
旁邊ㄧ桌有兩位小孩的，後面那桌有小孩的都吃的意興闌珊⋯⋯只有旁邊三位大媽的那桌吃的很開心？只是薑絲炒松阪豬就大叫說像「薑絲炒大腸」的口感耶！ 在旁邊聽了真的有的傻眼。
簡而言之，有小孩的不建議來此餐廳（該餐廳應該也沒有很歡迎）很餓或吃「熱炒」會口渴的也不要來因為餐廳會比較希望你點一手啤酒之類的，
後來吃完跑到美食街再補一碗丸龜製麵才回家。
瓦城啊！增設新品牌也不是這樣吧？","On the first meal, the lid was opened and the meal was put on a meal for four bowls to go up in five minutes.
Four people have to order six bowls of rice 180 yuan for rice to finish the five -tasting five dishes ~
If you do n’t provide water, you will look forward to ordering drinks, so we ordered a bottle of air bubble water. Although Japan will look forward to ordering drinks, it will be polite to send water. Our conclusion is that if there is no rest in the midfield, we can bring a smile with a smiley face. Service?What about this restaurant?
There are two children next to the table. The children who eat them in the back table are eaten. Only the table of the three aunts next to the table is very happy?It's just that ginger fried pine pigs yell like ""ginger silk stir -fried large intestine""!I listened to the real dumbfounded.
In short, some children do not recommend coming to this restaurant (the restaurant should not be very welcome) is very hungry or eat ""hot frying"".
Later, I ran to the food street and replenished a bowl of ball to make noodles before going home.
Wacheng!Isn't it the case for adding a new brand?"
很值得一試的新台菜，熟悉的台式元素不同組合的創新台菜，香煎司目魚香脆的皮和嫩魚肉清爽、花生米血骰子牛很下飯，配烏龍氣泡飲茶香還可解膩，虎皮蝦捲當前菜爽口鮮甜～甜點恆春綠豆蒜沒有蒜是屏東的特色綠豆品種。環境也很舒服輕鬆感，很適合和好友用餐小飲聊天的餐廳,"It is worth a try New Terrace, an innovative platform dish with different combinations of different combinations of tabletop elements, crispy skin and tender fish meat in the fried fish, and the peanut rice blood dice is very good. Nice, tiger -skinned shrimp rolls are fresh and sweet ~ Dessert Hengchun Mung Bean Garlic without garlic is the characteristic mung bean variety of Pingtung.The environment is also very comfortable and relaxed, it is very suitable for restaurants that chat with friends to drink and chat"

"桌子太小了
餐點全上後沒什麼位子放手機、
手也沒什麼地方放
然後一直想換盤子很煩
虱目魚有土味（對土味敏感的人吃的出來，不敏感應該沒差
我如果閉著眼睛根本猜不出來我吃的是麻婆豆腐
服務滿奇怪的
我平常去瓦城一定先給我水
這間卻需要我自己要
但很積極的想換我的盤子
因為桌子太小每次上菜都在喬位置
然後推薦東西也是很制式的什麼主打推什麼
新台菜但我覺得沒什麼感受到台菜的精神","The table is too small
After the meal, there is no seat to put the mobile phone,
There is no place to put it in the hand
Then I always want to change the plate very annoying
Satisher has soil flavor (people who are sensitive to soil flavor should be eaten, not sensitive should not be bad
I can't guess if I close my eyes at all, I eat Mapo tofu
Strange service
I usually go to Wacheng to give me water first
This room needs my own want
But very active want to change my plate
Because the table is too small every time you serve in the Joe position
Then I recommend what is very pre -pushing
Xintai cuisine but I don't think I feel the spirit of Taiwanese cuisine"

The service staff is clean and energetic, very enthusiastic about helping us at the table service and introduction of new brands of dishes

I am very recommended to come and eat 来"
"本來就覺得時時香蠻好吃的，那天臨時看到同集團的新品牌，馬上來試試看，鮑魚魯肉飯很強，但是它大概就是強到可以自己一碗飯獨撐大局，不需要配其它菜（會太鹹），建議可以兩三人分食嚐嚐厲害的高級魯肉飯，滷汁跟魯肉感覺的出來都是好的食材熬煮出來的，鮑魚也新鮮彈牙，再來醋溜馬鈴薯，火候剛好，雖然酸酸的本以為這道菜會走大陸菜路線不抱期待純粹想吃馬鈴薯絲，結果竟然有一種台味，類似記憶中麵攤吃的到的好滋味（升級精緻版），米血骰子牛真的是很有創意的搭配，好吃超多層次感，一下以為在吃真的米血糕一下又吃的到嫩骰子牛，混搭又不會怪（推），鳳梨蝦球印象中跟時時香的非常接近，爽口好吃，鳳梨甜（一定是有選過的）蝦子脆大隻，不會有外面那種外皮超厚超大蝦子本身是幼童的被欺騙感，松露蝦蒸蛋，感覺這道就是蒸蛋上面放點料好吃程度應該有天花板，結果這道最後上但我一口接一口的，單吃很讚配飯更棒，覺得可以再來一碗白飯，上面的松露香氣配上蝦仁絞肉大火快炒淋在蒸蛋上（我猜的做法）層次感跟口感都突破天花板啦
菜單的項目還不多 下回再去試試其它菜色
目前給予很高評價（希望之後不要太難訂位","I felt that it was very delicious from time to time. I temporarily saw the new brand of the same group on that day. Let's try it immediately. The abalone Lu Lu rice is very strong, but it is probably so strong that it can support the overall situation of a bowl of rice. Other dishes (it will be too salty), it is recommended that two or three people can eat and taste the powerful high -grade Lu meat rice. The marinade and Lu meat feel that they are boiled in good ingredients. The abalone is also fresh. Slote potatoes, just right, although the sourness originally thought that this dish would take the mainland food route without expecting to eat potato shreds, but there was a kind of flavor, similar to the good taste of the stalls in the memory. Edition), the rice blood dice beef is really a very creative match, delicious and more layered. I thought that I was eating the real rice blood cake and eating the tender dice beef. The pineapple shrimp ball is very close to the time incense. It is delicious and delicious. The pineapple is sweet (must have been selected) shrimp is crispy, and there will be no kind of outer skin and super large shrimp. , Swap Shrimp Steamed Egg, I feel that this is a ceiling on the degree of food for steamed eggs. As a result, I finally took a bite, and it was better to eat it. , The aroma of the truffle with shrimp meat, the heat of the meat, quickly stir -fry on the steamed egg (I guess the method) and the layered sense and taste have exceeded the ceiling
The menu item is not much next time to try other dishes
At present, it is given a high evaluation (I hope it is not too difficult to book the position afterwards"
服務態度親切，雖然價格有點偏高，白飯不像瓦城一樣可以無限續，但餐點都很好吃，也很有特色！,"The service attitude is cordial. Although the price is a bit high, the rice can be continued as infinitely like Wacheng, but the meals are delicious and very distinctive!"
"有點個虱目魚比較像台菜，但是呢其他的空心菜，雞塊還有一些菜品都像是原來瓦城的泰式食材，所以這個菜單實在是很有趣，不像真的不像台菜，但是店名叫「小香」新台菜料理，所以他們說是台菜就只好是「台菜」！

問ㄧ個服務的人，為何店名叫「小香」-回答：老闆高興！口氣真的不耐阿！

問ㄧ個服務的人，本是九孔，為何叫「鮑魚」？回答：不清楚！有鮑魚嗎？所以菜名是「炸騙集團」取的！

所以千萬別跟欣葉台菜比，那只能是「四不像」！","A bit like a Taiwanese cuisine, but there are other spoils, chicken pieces and some dishes are like Thai ingredients in Wacheng, so this menu is really interesting. However, the store is called ""Xiaoxiang"" New Taicai cuisine, so they said that it was ""Taiwanese cuisine""!

Ask a service person, why is the store named ""Xiaoxiang"" -Anshi: The boss is happy!It's really impatient!

Ask a service person, it was Jiu Kong, why is it called ""abalone""?Answer: Not clear!Is there abalone?So the name of the dish was taken by ""Fraud Group""!

So don't compare with Xinye Taiwanese, that can only be ""four different""!"
"聽聞瓦城集團推出新品牌，開幕沒多久6月即造訪。只是很可惜，「香香」在瓦城集團中最高價位，菜單全然是擷取「1010湘」「Yabi」「時時香」拼湊而成的新品牌。

例如：香香的紅燒肉取自1010湘的毛家燒肉、唯一不同是口味上以黑胡椒為基底。
例如：氣泡飲取自Yabi、高麗菜取自1010湘的臘肉高麗菜⋯

6月造訪時香香並不提供便宜的單杯飲品、且提供紅白酒服務。沒有「月月」豐富的酒類、沒有「時時香」多樣式的飯類、沒有「1010湘」酸辣分明的特色、實在真的非常失望。

兩人餐敘僅一杯單杯白酒，結帳是近2700，用餐環境也跟其他瓦城餐廳一樣喧嘩、沒有月月的安靜，從口味跟金額上，整體想走高價路線的邏輯，真的蠻讓人非常失望，也不建議花費180吃一碗九孔滷肉飯，真的不值得。","I heard that Wacheng Group launched a new brand, and the opening visited shortly after the opening.It is a pity that ""Xiangxiang"" is the highest price in the Wacheng Group. The menu is a new brand that captures ""1010 Xiang"", ""YABI"" and ""always incense"".

For example: Xiangxiang's braised pork is taken from 1010 Hunan's Mao family roasted meat. The only difference is that the taste is based on black pepper.
For example: Bubbles are taken from YABI, Korean cuisine is taken from 1010 Hunan's bacon Korean cabbage ...

During the June visit, Xiangxiang did not provide cheap single cups and provided red and white wine services.There are no ""Moon Moon"" rich wines, a variety of ""time incense"", and no ""1010 Xiang"" hot and sour characteristics. It is really disappointed.

The two of the two meals are only one glass of white wine, and the checkout is nearly 2700. The dining environment is as noisy as other Wacheng restaurants, and there is no quiet and quiet. From the taste and amount, the logic of the overall price route is really quite pretty. It is very disappointed. It is not recommended to spend 180 bowls of nine -hole braised pork rice. It is really not worth it."
"非常有創意的新台式料理
香煎虱目魚搭配油蔥醬出乎意料的口感","Very creative new table dishes
Crystal milkfish with shallot sauce produces unexpected taste"
瓦城集團新開的餐廳，口味不錯，但是是不供應白水，是比較遺憾，需要加價點瓶裝水或是飲料,"The newly opened restaurant in Wacheng Group has a good taste, but it is not supplying white water. It is a pity that it needs to increase the price of bottled water or drink"
"瓦城新品牌｜香香

全新品牌「SHANN SHANN(香香)」，首店進駐新光三越信義 A9，主打新台灣料理，賦予台菜新演繹

-就是時時香+YABI的結合版
店內一位女主管服務親切、一名男員工態度很好，必竟新開的餐館，其他人員服務上略顯生疏，但不影響用餐雅緻
整體感受就是旗下品牌的融合，但就會感受沒有特別之處，餐點也是表現瓦城水準
特別點選鮑魚滷肉飯，滷汁很香、但嚐鮮即可
氣泡茶飲推薦，很解膩
建議可以多增加一些台式經典菜色，會來的更有記憶點

-It is the combination of timely incense+yabi
A female leader in the store has a kind service and a male employee is very good. It must be newly opened restaurants. Other personnel services are slightly sparse, but it does not affect the elegant meal.
The overall experience is the fusion of its brand, but it will feel that there is no special place.
Choose abalone braised meat rice with special points. The marinade is very fragrant, but you can try your best.
Bubble tea is recommended, very greasy

🌟「花生米血骰子牛」💰350
🌟「臘香高麗菜」💰235
🌟「大蛤蜊冬瓜上湯」💰398
🌟「白飯」💰30

香煎虱目魚上面有很多有點像米香的東西
這道我覺得很好吃 可以點!
黑松露鮮蝦蒸蛋這樣賣498 我覺得有點太貴
因為蝦子是切碎的 比較鹹需要搭配白飯一起吃
蛤蜊湯裡面的蛤蜊都超級無敵大!!很新鮮
也不會像外面這湯很容易因為薑絲太多喝起來很辣
裡面冷氣很強 喝個一兩碗很舒服!❤️
虎皮鮮蝦捲、花生米血這兩道都是有香菜的
害怕香菜的人要記得避開 😆
這兩道和高麗菜我覺得就中規中矩 普通
也許是剛開幕的關係 員工雖然很多但感覺比較菜
點餐的當下沒有馬上覆誦
(但我講完全部之後後有 只是會不知道對方當下有沒有聽到><）

There are a lot of things that are a bit like Mi Xiang on the fried milkfish
I think this is delicious!
Black loose dewye shrimp steamed eggs are sold like this 498, I think it's a bit too expensive
Because the shrimp is chopped, it is relatively salty, you need to eat it with white rice
The clams in the clam soup are super invincible !! Very fresh
It's not like the soup outside, it's easy to drink too much ginger.
The air -conditioning inside is very comfortable to drink one or two bowls! ❤️
Tiger skin shrimp rolls and peanut rice blood are both coriander
People who are afraid of coriander should remember to avoid 😆
I think these two and Korean cabbage
Maybe it ’s a relationship that has just opened. Although there are many employees, they feel more dish
I didn’t recite immediately when I ordered the meal

"每道都非常好吃，定價也很合理，
廚師和服務人員都很用心，值得再訪！","Everyway is very delicious, and the pricing is also very reasonable.
Both the chef and the service staff are very careful and are worth visiting!"
每一道都非常好吃，把台菜做出新創意！相約再來～,"Each is very delicious, make new ideas for Taiwan cuisine!Come again ~"
菜色選擇性不多，推薦的菜色都還不錯；要收水資的餐廳，價位中等；服務人員很親切，平日午餐用餐沒有限制用餐時間,"The dishes are not much selected, and the recommended dishes are not bad; the restaurant to collect water capital, the price is medium; the service staff is very kind, and there is no restriction time for meals for lunch and dining on weekdays."
推薦松露鮮蝦蒸蛋 料超多很滿足！口水雞和3.5杯雞的肉很嫩、味道好、份量也夠～,"Recommended truffle fresh shrimp steamed eggs are very satisfying!The meat of saliva chicken and 3.5 cup of chicken is very tender, tastes good, and the portion is enough ~"
瓦城系統的台菜餐廳，空心菜過老，蝦捲沾醬太鹹建議少沾，松阪豬紅綠辣椒🌶️都超級辣要小心,"The Taiwanese restaurant in the Wacheng system is too old -fashioned, and the shrimp rolls are too salty to be too salty. Matsusaka pig red and green peppers 🌶️ are super spicy"
第一次來吃小香，很喜歡這邊的氛圍。食物上菜很快又美味，很適合家庭聚餐,"For the first time to eat Xiaoxiang, I like the atmosphere here.The food is very delicious and delicious, which is very suitable for family dinner"
"餐點上菜速度快，菜色口味偏重要配白飯

The taste is not bad.Abalone braised pork rice is sweet but grain is clearly the taste I like!It's worth trying"
香煎虱目魚真的必吃 煎得香脆的虱目魚上面撒上米香 口感味道都好讚🤤 虎皮鮮蝦卷 外皮薄脆好咬 搭上特製的醬料👍滷肉飯的滷肉也好入味很軟嫩 沒想過台菜能有這麼多創意的新吃法♥️,Crystal milkfish really must eat fried and crispy milkfish and sprinkle with rice incense. It ’s very soft and tender. I did n’t think that Taiwanese cuisine can have so many creative new ways of eating ♥ ️
鮑魚滷肉飯 香潤黏甜 超好吃，臘肉高麗菜 口味很棒（就高麗菜 品種不好 吃起來菜硬），豆腐乳嫩雞 新口味，咖啡豬排 讚，松露蒸蛋 松露香 蛋嫩，烏龍茶氣泡飲 好喝,"Abalone braised meat rice is sweet and sweet, and the flavor of the bacon cabbage is great (the variety of Korean vegetables is not delicious), tofu milk tender chicken new flavor, coffee pig steak praise, truffle steamed egg truffle egg tender Oolong tea bubbles drink good"
非常潮的新臺菜料理，菜好吃、風景佳、用餐環境乾淨舒適～很適合三五好友、家庭、商務聚餐吃吃喝喝～招牌必吃：虎皮蝦卷/花生米血骰子牛/腐乳空心菜/香煎虱目魚，都是滿下酒的菜～可惜沒有台啤18天，外國朋友來必推薦的台灣代表酒款啊啊啊～希望之後能有😆,"Very trendy New stage cuisine, delicious dishes, good scenery, clean and comfortable dining environment ~ very suitable for three or five friends, family, business dinner, eat and drink ~ Signboard must eat: tiger skin shrimp rolls/peanuts blood dice beef/bean curd cabbage/fried fried vegetables/fried fried Satisher is a dish full of wine ~ Unfortunately, there is no 18 days of Taiwan beer.

餐點精緻價格合理，寶寶很喜歡松露蒸蛋、腐皮蝦捲，冬瓜蛤蜊湯推推！超蛤的～～～～虱目魚香噴噴，不愛吃魚的媽媽也吃得很開心🫶🏻🫶🏻,"The meal is exquisite and the price is reasonable. The baby likes truffle steamed eggs, rotten shrimp rolls, and pushes the melon clam soup!Super clam ~~~~ milkfish fragrant, mothers who do not like fish also eat very happy 🫶🏻🫶🏻"
今天吃口水雞、空心菜、松露蒸蛋、虱目魚、冬瓜蛤蜊，都沒有雷超讚，服務人員每一位都很有耐心、親切，整體餐廳氣氛也不錯，六人用餐愉快，Lucy也有親切地告訴我們現在的活動以及問我們用餐體驗，超讚,"Today, I eat saliva chicken, spinning vegetables, truffle steamed eggs, milkfish, and winter melon clams. There are no Lei Chaoxuan. Each of the service staff is very patient and kind. The overall restaurant atmosphere is also good. Tell us the current activities and ask us to have a dining experience, super happy"
如果是招待朋友真的別來會超漏氣！週末用餐正餐時間差不多半滿而已，但外場服務生整體表現像是建教合作的學生一樣讓人不悅與搖頭。想吃瓦城集團的中菜去吃時時香即可，至少不會像這裡連喝一杯水都需要買一罐礦泉水，可能餐廳很想推wine paring餐點鹹度直接拉滿..身為吃過時時香十次以上的客人，訂位時有著錯誤期待以為這裡是高級版時時香，結果吃到大家都在嫌棄，絕對沒有下一次了！,"If you are entertaining friends, do n’t leak out!The meal time for meals on the weekend is almost half full, but the overall performance of the waiter in the field is as uncomfortable and shaken as the students who cooperate with the teaching cooperation.If you want to eat the Chinese cuisine of the Wacheng Group, you can eat it. At least you do n’t need to buy a can of mineral water like drinking a glass of water here. Maybe the restaurant wants to push the salt of the meal for the meal. Occasionally, guests who have more than ten times incense have mistakenly expect to think that this is the high -end version of the time. As a result, everyone is having abandonment, and there is absolutely no next time!"
"覺得餐點還不錯，尤其是那蒸蛋，感覺愛了😍
甜點跟氣泡飲也不錯喝","I think the meal is not bad, especially the steamed egg, I feel loved 😍
Dessert and bubble drink are also good to drink"
"口味適中，餐點好吃！很適合配飯😅
服務人員服務佳
整體不錯！推薦👍","The taste is moderate, and the meals are delicious!Very suitable for meals 饭
Good service staff service
Good overall!Recommendation"
虎皮鮮蝦捲非常好吃，菜的份量也很足夠，很有台灣特色的餐廳，很適合帶外國朋友來。,"Tiger skin fresh shrimp rolls are very delicious, and the amount of vegetables is also sufficient. It is very suitable for restaurants in Taiwan, which is very suitable for foreign friends."
今天兩個人點了4道菜，每一道菜都很下飯，會推薦朋友來，好吃😋,"Today, two people ordered 4 dishes, each dish was very good, and I would recommend friends, delicious"
"直接評論重點：東西不難吃，但就少那麼一點！拿「花生米血骰子牛」來說，我想吃米血，但是米血太小吃不過癮，骰子牛又感覺似乎是肉豆，沒有存在感！但難吃嗎？並沒有！就是那種你吃完這道菜色完之後，你覺得心癢癢，然後衝到廚房跟廚師說：拜託！求你給我整塊米血！就是這種感覺！

再來，「九孔鮑魚滷肉飯」，完全的北部肉燥飯味道，對於這道菜的評價是，必須要帶著「想像品食西餐」那種感覺去品嚐，細嚼慢嚥的細細品味肥肉跟米飯衝擊，然後鮑魚的存在，應該是想要襯托價格，這道應該嗯… 180元！

總結，對於以往瓦城的經營模式，我個人覺得這間很不一樣！好吃與否，就給大家參考囉！（桌子真的有點小）","The point of comment directly: It is not difficult to eat, but it is less!Take ""Peanut Rice Blood Dice Cow"", I want to eat rice blood, but the rice blood is too addictive, and the dice beef feels like meat beans, no presence!But is it unbearable?No!It is that after you finish this dish, you feel itchy, and then rush to the kitchen to say: Please!Please give me a whole piece of rice!It's this feeling!

Then, ""Nine -hole abalone braised pork rice"", the completely northern meat and dry rice taste, the evaluation of this dish is that you must take the feeling of ""imagine food and eat Western food"" to taste. Taste fat meat and rice, and then the abalone existence should be to set off the price. This should be ... 180 yuan!

In summary, I personally think this is very different for the previous Wacheng's business model!Is it delicious or not, give you a reference!(The table is really a bit small)"
餐點特殊美味 服務親切主動 價格偏高但值得再訪,"Special delicious service for meals is closely active, but it is worth visiting"
第一次吃創意臺菜 真的很好吃 不突兀 凸顯台灣特色,The first time I ate creative Taiwanese dishes is really delicious and not abruptly highlighting the characteristics of Taiwan
