"很可愛的小店，就在大直河濱公園附近，店裡外都佈置的很溫馨很舒適，就像在朋友家喝酒一樣輕鬆。
小食有親手包的水餃，酒單雖選項不多，但每一瓶的介紹都很詳細很清楚，如數家珍。
很推薦三五好友聚會慢慢聊天喝酒，是可以細細品的地方❤️","The very cute shop is near the Dazhi Riverside Park. The shop is very warm and comfortable, just like drinking at a friend's house.
There are dumplings that are wrapped in snacks. Although there are not many options for wine lists, the introduction of each bottle is very detailed and clear, such as several treasures.
It is recommended to chat and drink slowly for three or five friends."
這裡很可以啊。不管你是一個人，兩個人很多人都非常適合這，燈光美氣氛佳，酒的種類多到你無法想像，老闆親切也很會介紹，你還不快起身來這放鬆品酒一下。,"This is very good.No matter you are alone, many of them are very suitable for this. The lights are beautiful. There are so many types of wine. You can't imagine it. The boss will also introduce it well. You don't get up here to relax."
"今天去參加一個有趣的葡萄酒分享會，以往所知道的是會分析酒種、酒莊、產地、口感...等等，而這次分享會光是名稱就很不一樣：輕鬆品酒會之選瓶酒好過年。光想到就覺得有趣，一般大家葡萄酒配的都是起司跟沙拉米等等之類的，但居然有人要來介紹台式年菜的配酒哲學，兩紅兩白一人$450，何樂而不為。
一開始先分析了年菜的口味：鹹、酸、甜、苦、辣，再剖析葡萄酒的口感：澀、苦、酸、甜、鹹，什麼樣的酒可以加強什麼樣的口味，什麼樣的酒又可以弱化什麼樣的感官，相當有趣。
更特別的是直接端出來滿滿一盤的黑白切甚至是熱騰騰的紅豆餅，讓我們直接比較看看同一種口味搭配四種不同的酒的感受，比起文言文來說，很直觀的就可以分辨喜歡什麼不喜歡什麼，甚至，從來沒想過原來豆乾沾辣椒配甜白酒這麼的對味啊啊啊啊🤣","Today I will participate in an interesting wine sharing meeting. What I know in the past is to analyze wine, winery, origin, taste ... and so on. Bottle wine is better for the New Year.I think it ’s fun to think of it. Generally, everyone is equipped with cheese, salad, and so on. However, some people actually want to introduce the philosophy of wine with Taiwanese New Year's dishes.
At the beginning, the taste of New Year's cuisine was analyzed: salty, sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy, and then analyzed the taste of wine: astringent, bitter, sour, sweet, salty, what kind of wine can be enhanced, what kind of taste, what kind of wine, what kind of wine What kind of sensory can be weakened, it is quite interesting.
What's more special is that the black and white cut or even hot red bean cakes are directly ended up. Let us directly compare the feelings of the same taste and four different wines. Compared with the classical Chinese, it is very intuitive. You can distinguish what you like or not, and even, never thought that the dried beans and peppers with sweet white wine are so right ah ah ah"
餐酒館非常棒，氣氛極佳，老闆也非常熱情，配上好品質的葡萄酒，非常適合下班小酌，門口有共享雨傘非常方便！,"The restaurant is very good, the atmosphere is excellent, and the boss is also very enthusiastic. With good quality wine, it is very suitable for get off work. It is very convenient to share umbrellas at the door!"
"酒好喝，老闆友善，
環境舒適溫馨！
還得到老闆煮的冬至湯圓，
太療癒了！","The wine is delicious, the boss is friendly,
The environment is comfortable and warm!
Also get the winter solstice dumplings cooked by the boss,
Too healing!"
輕工業裝潢風格，老闆對酒講究，同事的Farewell party 舉辦場所，才有機會發現這間優質的店。大推！,"Light industry decoration style, the boss pays attention to wine, the place where colleagues Farewell Party hosted a place to find this high -quality store.Push!"
"輕鬆，舒服的喝酒好環境
老闆選的酒都好喝，完全不雷喔！
Chill~","Easy, comfortable to drink a good environment
The wine chosen by the boss is delicious, and it is completely unsightly!
Chill ~"
貼心又溫馨，可以自己帶外食。概念有創意，可以喝半瓶，也可以share別人的半瓶！很喜歡！,"I can bring food by myself.The concept is creative, you can drink half a bottle, or you can share half a bottle of others!I like it very much!"
很棒的空間，適合與朋友在夜晚來此小酌。也很喜歡用折扣的價格喝半瓶酒的概念。,"A great space, suitable for friends with friends at night.I also like to drink half a bottle of wine at a discount."
"喜歡素人推薦
最真實跟我們一樣

#超級概念店 #一人一半感情不會散
#品味人生 #有專業呵護 #不怕喝到瞎貨
#一分錢一分貨 #大直好地方","I like amateur recommendation
The most real is the same as us

#Super Concept Store #One person half of the relationship will not be scattered
# #Have professional care #Are you afraid to drink blind goods
# #一 #直 直"
酒單很帥，介紹得很用心，一定會再來～,"The wine list is very handsome, I am very careful, I will definitely come again ~"
"每回來這裡總是充滿驚喜，店主Alex挑選的酒款都十分有趣，可以嘗試到許多不常見的酒款，累積更多經驗值。

更多時候是為了喝杯酒放鬆來到這裡，自己一個人在家開瓶喝不完很吃力，來50/45可以點半瓶酒喝，沒有壓力，非常貼心的半瓶酒服務，推薦大家來這裡找尋有意思的葡萄酒，可以跟店主聊聊關於每款酒背後的故事，真的很有趣。","Every time I come back, it is always full of surprises. The wine selected by the owner Alex is very interesting. You can try many uncommon wines and accumulate more experience.

More often, to relax here for drinking a glass of wine, I can't drink it alone at home alone. If you come to 50/45, you can order half a bottle of wine to drink. There is no pressure. It is very intimate half a bottle of wine. It is recommended that everyone come. Finding interesting wines here, you can talk to the owner about the story behind each wine, which is really interesting."
氣氛好，老闆熱愛紅白酒好專業，還可帶外食，下次還會來,The atmosphere is good.
可以只開半瓶酒又可以帶外食的店，老闆對紅酒的專業知識也很不錯，不懂都可以問他👍，環境舒適，沒壓力。 …,"You can only open half a bottle of wine and can bring food. The boss's professional knowledge about red wine is also very good. If you do n’t know, you can ask him. The environment is comfortable and there is no pressure.Mowing"
晚上獨自一人享用美酒、環境舒適的好地方，老闆會依照客人今天想喝的口味推薦酒單，每次都能喝到很對味的酒~,"In a good place where wine and environment are comfortable alone at night, the boss will recommend the wine list according to the taste that the guests want to drink today."
可以點到很特別的紅酒，法國的產區，老闆會詳細介紹，滷味跟水餃都好吃，很能放鬆聊天的店,"You can order very special red wine. French production areas. The boss will introduce it in detail. Lochi and dumplings are delicious, and they can relax the chat shop."
老闆作法很有創意，人也很親切。可以用親民價格喝到好喝的紅酒。,The boss's practice is very creative and people are very kind.You can drink delicious red wine at a close price.
"老闆人很好，我這種品酒菜雞來店，完全不會感受到壓力，老闆很有耐心一一介紹，推薦的酒都頂呱呱。

室外坐燈光美氣氛佳，而且座位的setup很有趣，推。

FYI,運氣好還會有免費餅乾零食。","The boss is very good. I will not feel the pressure at all. The boss is very patient.

The outdoor lighting is beautiful, and the setup of the seat is interesting and pushed.

FYI, good luck and free biscuits snacks."
"跟朋友聚會輕鬆自在的地方
老闆很親切","Where to meet with friends relaxed and comfortable
The boss is very kind"
老闆很有人情味，店裡面可以攜帶外食，歡迎喜歡葡萄酒的人，自己帶食物或是Uber eats去搭配不同酒款！葡萄酒價格實在，店裡空間舒適！,"The boss is very humane. You can carry out food in the store. Welcome to people who like wine. Take food or Uber Eats to match different wines!The price of wine is real, and the space in the store is comfortable!"
品飲葡萄酒最重要的不只是對的人、對的氣氛，還要有對的酒，本來不是特別愛喝葡萄酒，也不是很懂喝，因為朋友介紹才來的，後來就變成習慣性一想放鬆，就會來這裡小酌一杯，聽聽葡萄酒的故事，和好友聚會，真的是一個很適合讓酒精作祟的空間呢！,"The most important thing for drinking wine is not only the right person, the right atmosphere, but also the right wine. I did not particularly love to drink wine, nor did I know how to drink, because the friend introduced it, and later it became a habitual one. If you want to relax, you will come here to have a drink. Listening to the story of wine and gathering with friends is really a space that is very suitable for alcohol!"
"老闆非常和善！
臨時決定幫朋友慶生，老闆用心變出蠟燭，還招待壽星生日酒～

桌數不多，佈置很溫馨
大推👍","The boss is very kind!
Temporarily decided to help friends celebrate his birthday.

There are not many tables, and the layout is very warm
Big Push"
很不錯的喝酒的地方，有氣氛,"Very good place to drink, there is an atmosphere"
嗜酒人的好去處，可以體驗到別人喝過的酒也可以自己點。重點是還可以點自己喜歡吃的東西來。很棒。已訪多次。,"For the good places of alcoholic people, you can experience the wine that others have drank.The point is that you can also order what you like to eat.great.Has been visited many times."
晚上會有一個住對面豪宅的神秘客座高橋大廚與他的水某下樓做下酒小點。以完全不按牌理出牌的方式融合台日歐的美食元素，讓你的味蕾整晚驚喜連連。而且高橋大廚是純粹做興趣的，性價比無敵高，使該店為大直必訪之處。,"In the evening, there will be a mysterious guest of the opposite mansion Takahashi, and his water will go downstairs to make a small wine.Incorporate the food elements of Taiwan and Europe in a way that do not follow the cards at all, make your taste buds surprise all night.In addition, Chef Takahashi is purely interested, and the cost -effective is invincible, making the store a must -visit."
"This is my ideal wine house. Friendly people, affordable wine and Taiwanese foods. It's really a good idea that you can take your dinner here on Wednesday to find some wine which goes well with your own food!
這是我理想中的紅酒館。許多入門價位的好酒款、還可以在周三晚上帶自己的晚餐來搭酒！","This is my identity friend. Friendly People, AFFORDABLE WINE and TAIWANESE FOODS. It's Really A Good Idea that you can take you SOME WINE Which Goes Well with Your Own Food!
This is my ideal red tavern.Many entry -level good wines, can also bring their own dinner on Wednesday night to set up wine!"
環境很舒服，整體的氣氛很chill，店內推薦的酒很專業也很好喝，體驗下來的感覺很好，是會再訪的好店家，是個可以放鬆週末的好所在。,"The environment is very comfortable, the overall atmosphere is very Chill, the wine recommended in the store is very professional and delicious, and it feels good to experience it. It is a good shop that can be visited. It is a good place to relax the weekend."
老闆非常親切、氣氛非常輕鬆、價格又非常合理的歐式小酒館，餐飲不多但可點外送，老闆的水餃跟火腿起士盤跟酒很搭。,"The boss is very kind, the atmosphere is very relaxed, and the price is very reasonable. There are not many catering but can be delivered. The boss's dumplings are very good with the ham cheese plate."
在住宅區開酒吧開到深夜，擾亂鄰居安寧，製造髒亂跟噪音，常常有警察來關心，這樣的地方請開業者自制，不然訴諸公權力!,"Open the bar in the residential area until late at night, disrupt the neighbor's peace, and create dirty chaos and noise. There are often police officers to care about it."
舒服，專業的一家店，絕對適合小酌，和老闆聊葡萄酒會有一想不到的收穫，夏天一定要來吃葡萄酒冰棒，顛覆你的想像！,"A comfortable, professional shop, absolutely suitable for drinking, talk to the boss about wine, there will be an unexpected gain. You must come to eat wine popsicles in summer to subvert your imagination!"
氛圍很棒 老闆也很專業,The atmosphere is great and the boss is very professional
每次不知道要點什麼酒，只需要跟老闆說想喝甜的? 還是果香的? 他都能給出合適的建議，好厲害!,"Every time I do n’t know what to order, I just need to tell the boss to drink sweet? Or is it fruity? He can give appropriate suggestions, so good!"
點了好吃的滷味，是老闆用心採買的，連辣椒都好吃。老闆人很好，地方很乾淨舒服。價格很合理。,"I ordered the delicious lofli, which was bought by the boss with the heart, and even the pepper was delicious.The boss is very good, the place is very clean and comfortable.The price is reasonable."
點了一瓶很棒的Napa 紅酒，環境還可以，店長很細心的說明各種酒，只有白葡萄酒/紅葡萄酒/氣泡酒。,"I ordered a bottle of NAPA red wine. The environment is okay. The manager carefully explained various wines, only white wine/red wine/bubble wine."

"我真的很喜歡這個地方。一個我喜歡用葡萄酒放鬆身心的地方，這裡有一個舒適的氛圍，那裡有知識淵博的葡萄酒工作人員，作為一個酒鬼，你真的沒有什麼可以要求的了。那裡的葡萄酒選擇也很有趣，而且不是一些標準的釀酒葡萄，所以去那裡學習新東西總是很有趣。現在是生活的常客了！

強烈推薦！ ！","I really like this place.I like to relax my body and mind with wine. There is a comfortable atmosphere here. There is a knowledgeable wine staff member. As a wine ghost, you really have nothing to ask.The choice of wine there is also very interesting, and it is not some standard wine grapes, so it is always interesting to go there to learn new things.Now is a frequent guest of life!

Recommended strongly!Intersection"
50/45是一個有趣的品酒場所。這不是 BYOD，而是 BYOD，自備食物！您可以選擇喝一整瓶或只喝一半，即 50/45。這個地方非常隱密而且非常舒適。店主很友好，當然也了解他的葡萄酒。有一位神秘廚師在附近徘徊。當你有機會時，一定要抓住他的食物。,"50/45 is an interesting wine tasting place.This is not Byod, but byod, self -provided food!You can choose to drink a whole bottle or only half, that is, 50/45.This place is very secretive and very comfortable.The owner is very friendly, and of course he also knows his wine.One mysterious chef wandered nearby.When you have a chance, you must catch his food."
"某天下午想找個地方坐坐，找到這家外觀看似文青咖啡廳，但原來是專賣紅白酒的50/45winehaus ，這裡特別的是實施共享經濟模式，可以用50%的價錢購買喜歡的半瓶酒，剩下半瓶酒則以45%價錢出售，那天在這喝了一下午的咖啡後很喜歡這裡的氣氛，後來也來參與了品酒會
店內的櫃檯是小小吧台，簡單的四個位子，比起我印像中比較難以親近的酒類專賣店，更像是溫馨的咖啡廳，記得第一次走進時沒有任何的壓力，店內的裝潢也非常舒服、平易近人，整體呈現暖色調，除了吧台的位子外也有幾桌沙發座椅，很適合三五好友一起來放鬆、喝杯紅白酒，不過店內位子不算多，建議大家提早打電話確認位子哦

品酒會體驗
https://57lin.com/5045winehaus/","One afternoon, I wanted to find a place to sit in the afternoon and find this appearance that looks like Wenqing coffee shop, but it turned out to be 50/45winehaus specializing in red and white wine. This is especially the implementation of the sharing economy model. Half a bottle of wine, the remaining half bottles of wine were sold at 45%. After drinking the coffee here that day, I liked the atmosphere here. Later, I also participated in the wine tasting meeting.
The counter in the store is a small bar, the simple four seats, which is more like a warm coffee shop than the more difficult to get close to my impression. Remember that there is no pressure when I first enter. The interior decoration is also very comfortable and approachable. The overall is warm. In addition to the seat of the bar, there are also a few tables of sofa seats. It is very suitable for three or five friends to relax and drink a glass of red and white wine. Call to confirm the seat
