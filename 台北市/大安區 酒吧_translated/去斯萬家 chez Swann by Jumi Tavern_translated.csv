一進門是一整條長吧檯，很適合週間夜晚和朋友小聚，也很適合一個人去喝一杯、聊一聊的深夜小酒吧。氣氛很好、卻不會彼此干擾。

二樓多人座位區，如同作者自身背景店內物件多是從歐洲特別挑選進口的古物，讓人有置身法國巴黎沙龍的錯覺，每區都有不同的特色，還有賭桌坐位很特別，可以依照當天人數和心情選擇喜歡的座位

🥟這邊餐點最受稱讚的是日式冰花煎餃，口味居然有傳說中的香菜水餃！！我覺得香菜味不至於很濃不喜歡吃香菜的可以來吃看看！

🍷調酒幾乎都為店家特色酒單，以茶咖啡入酒為主，像是朋友喝的是「齊天大聖」內含包種、奇異果、白酒、櫻花、蘋果牛奶，口感喝起來輕盈爽口，彷彿漫步在花果山有種春夏的感覺。我喝的是「百香果特調」除了百香果還加上接骨木花、薄荷與
檸檬香茅，香氣十足帶點微酸夏天氛圍。

受 The most praise of the meal here is the Japanese -style ice flower fried dumplings. There are legendary coriander dumplings!IntersectionI don't think the smell of coriander is not very strong. If you don't like to eat coriander, you can come and eat!

"被店家灌單，除了多收酒錢，單價收的價格也比菜單上的高，前後刷退三四次（還是我們必須上下跑，店家就站在收銀機前面被動的等我們）…….，結帳金額本來是$59xx後來我們確認完發現應實收$38xx…..

很令人納悶！因為每次點餐點酒後這位綁馬尾戴眼鏡的酒保都跟我們逐項確認過…
看店家的態度好像都蠻不以為然，也沒有什麼表示歉意😅😅希望這不是店家慣性作風。

然後這裡的酒要馬大好要馬大壞。我們點的酒完全沒什麼酒味….不知道是比例錯還是根本忘記加酒….後來上一杯特別推薦的飲品居然是$420的仙渣汁😂😂真的謝謝～ 朋友去反應之後酒保的回應是：「完全沒有放酸梅進去呀！我試喝也沒有問題」…. 嗯，但現場愛跑知名酒吧的8位友人個別淺嚐時都表示此飲品有無酒精酸梅湯的即視感…..

說這裡的bar food好吃嗎？我們也覺得實在是過譽了….. 食物份量不均，味道也極為普通。
每一隻鴨腿又乾又扁又可憐，去掉冰花後的煎餃小巧可愛..我們點了六盤而上的顆數不同，本想說限量義大利麵應該不會雷了吧？結果是裡面居然「完全沒有任何料」的醬拌麵😂😂看到隔壁桌以為是清燙麵線甚至直接拿筷子夾哈哈哈不小心笑出來sorry….

總之，一切都是很令人震驚。 對於有礙觀瞻的酒醉客人也是放任。我想在我們心中真的很難是一個合格的質感or專業酒吧….. 但如果不在乎品質只是想感受氣氛的人，這裡可以來感受看看～","In addition to collecting more wine money by the store, the price of the unit price is higher than on the menu. Back and forth three or four times (or we must run up and down, the store stands in front of the cash register and wait for us to be passive) ... The checkout amount was originally $ 59XX. Later, we confirmed that it should be closed at $ 38XX ...

Very worse!Because after every order of ordering, the wine insurance that ties the ponytail glasses has been confirmed with us ...
Looking at the attitude of the store seems to be quite disagreed, there is nothing to apologize. I hope this is not the inertial style of the store.

Then the wine here wants to be a big horse.The wine we ordered has no wine at all ... I don't know if it is the wrong or forget to add wine at all ... Later, a specially recommended drink was actually $ 420. : ""I didn't go in at all! I have no problem in trying to drink."" Well, but 8 friends who love to run the well -known bars at the scene said that when they tasted it, they said that there was a sense of sight of the sour sour plum soup in this drink ...

Is Bar Food here delicious?We also feel that it is too well -known ... The food has uneven amount and the taste is extremely ordinary.
Each duck leg is dry, flat, and pitiful. The fried dumplings after the ice flowers are small and cute .. We ordered the six plates and the number of up tops. I wanted to say that the limited Italian noodles should not be thunder?As a result, the sauce noodles that were actually ""completely without any ingredients at all"" saw that the next table thought it was clear the hot noodles or even took the chopsticks directly. Hahaha accidentally laughed out sorry ....

In short, everything is very shocking.The drunk guests who are observed are also allowed.I think it is really difficult to be a qualified texture or professional bar in our hearts ... but if you don't care about the quality, you just want to feel the atmosphere, here you can feel it ~",False

"茶酒跟經典都很讚的地方
兩者做結合的話

甜點的話私心推薦馬卡龍
無論是冰的吃或解凍吃都很香
要是第一次來的話則是推薦一定要試試看

If the two are combined
I very much recommend Tieguanyin's Negroni and Jin Xuan's Martini
I want to eat supper late at night and there are fried dumplings with each other
If you don't add special sauce, you will regret it
For desserts, I recommend Macaron privately
Whether it is ice or thawing, it is very fragrant
If you come for the first time, it is recommended to try it
The ""Lemon Cake"" cup is special, you can drink the flavor of scorched fragrance
It is a rare unique flavor elsewhere elsewhere
But if you are a cooked customer, please be careful
Because there will be an inexplicable SHOT Cup on the table",False
"主打茶酒的infuse調酒。

可適度為難調酒師製作特調（但最好等不忙時，要珍惜能被欺負的bartender)

食物品質佳，在預算較高的情況下，是可以滿足胃和味蕾的好地方。

以下照片皆為特調","Infuse bartender for the main tea wine.

It can be moderate to make a special tone for the dilemma (but it is best to wait for the Bartender that can be bullied when you are not busy)

Food quality is good, and in the case of high budget, it is a good place to satisfy the stomach and taste buds.

The following photos are special",False
