氣氛很不錯，適合聚餐聊天的地方，餐點口味偏鹹（應該是我吃比較淡）啤酒杯是不是太少了，點啤酒的時候說沒杯子了要等一下🤣空間略小，人多的時候顯得擁擠，整體還不錯，但是我覺得有設低消有點不適當（個人感受啦！）,"The atmosphere is very good, suitable for dinner and chat, the taste of the meal is too salty (it should be that I eat more lightly) Is there too little beer glass?

沒吃到。 只是想告訴店家跟消費者可能會碰到這種狀況。 前一天訂位說6點客滿，店家告知訂8點的第二輪比較保險，所以就訂8點。 周六晚上準時8點到了之後店家告知要等一下，因為店內客人還未離開。此時店外有一組客人坐在店外的座位，但我不清楚他們是否有訂位。過了5分鐘，又告知抱歉久等，等下會招待酒水。 再過了約莫3分鐘，坐店外的那組被請進店內，然後我們被告知店內已無座位，店家說訂位出了一點問題，問我們是否接受坐在戶外，會招待一杯酒水。我們不願意於是就離開了。 店員很客氣。只是我們覺得若訂位時不能確定有位置可以不接受訂位，若到現場室內沒位置可以直接說，不用說叫我們稍等一下。 總之，以後要訂位的人自己注意一下，有可能訂了位最後到現場才被告知要坐戶外，就醬。,"Did not eat it.I just want to tell the store that they may encounter this situation with consumers.The day before, the booking said that 6 o'clock is full.
