與其說是居酒屋，其實應該是說一般餐飲店或是仿日本料理店比較適合...

實際將 冷物、食事、燒物、揚物、串燒 全部都叫一輪... 真的是每一樣都失敗，沒有一個好吃的

而且可能是晚上九點半就打烊，這個區塊無法做超過 10點的生意，附近的人下班後就變死城，晚上來，客人不多，一口氣就將料理全部都上，這時候毫無節奏可言，因為這個是絕對不行的事，料理一下就冷掉。

雖然說料理一來，熱的時候就已經先品嚐，但是串燒的豬串有豬臭味，雞串有雞腥味，然後茶泡飯是微溫，根本不熱，烤魚也是完全不燙口，然後又全部上，瞬間就冷掉。

唐揚雞的炸粉是偏甜又膩，沾醬是很奇怪的麻醬美乃滋？？整體的料理調味很奇怪..

而且酒單非常少，基本上就是日本清酒種類比較多，但是都是一瓶瓶的販售，可能利潤比較好吧？ 店裡結帳櫃台旁牆上好像有類似唎酒師的證照？如果對於酒這麼講究，怎麼會提供這麼失敗的料理.. 要怎麼搭配好酒？！

而且生啤酒，啤酒杯內緣都是泡沫，表示跟含有油質的碗盤一起洗，或是直接跟一般碗盤共用菜瓜布，這就是一個大地雷，會嚴重影響生啤品質，而且店裡感覺啤酒機器也沒依照標準清洗..唉

如果要稱為居酒屋，我沒看過九點半就打烊的，一般這個時間不正是才要開始喝嗎？所以..這家就是純吃飯聊天，然後有個酒可以小酌一下，當成一般仿日式料理的店家隨便吃頓飯就好，不用太期待。難怪很多人都說南港是美食沙漠，真的是超雷，說好吃的，給五星的，是不是朋友幫忙灌水？

其實給一星也沒差，因為店家根本沒有在管評論，這種店還可以經營七年.... 真是太可怕了，而且提供刷卡還不開發票，是不是應該要查一下？

Tang Yang chicken's fried powder is sweet and greasy.IntersectionThe overall dishes are strange ..

And raw beer, the inner edge of the beer glass is foam, indicating that washing with a dish containing oil, or directly shared with ordinary dishes and plates. This is a large mines. I feel that the beer machine is not cleaned according to the standard .. Well

It is good to eat a meal as a shop that is a general imitation Japanese cuisine. Don't look forward to it.No wonder many people say that Nangang is a gourmet desert. It is really super mine.
