Not quite an authentic Thai restaurant. Roast and barbecue pork was good. Fried water spinach and green curry was my favourite. I think the dishes should be a little more sour.

羊排好嫩喔，牛小排也不錯、咖哩螃蟹、沙公很新鮮、酒味濃厚味道偏中式料理風味、咖喱味偏淡、檸檬魚是去骨的、綠咖哩跟青木瓜沙拉都很讚、糯米飯很香糯棒棒的。,"The lamb chops are so tender, the cow small chop is also good, curry crabs, sandygongs are very fresh, the taste of strong wine tastes, the flavor of Chinese cuisine, light curry flavor, lemon fish is bone, green curry and green papaya salad are all very good The glutinous rice is very fragrant."

今天的木瓜涼拌實在太辣🌶️🌶️了，那盤蝦醬四季豆也煸的太苦了，感覺就是廚師急著午休。

小麥🌾🍻不錯喝。

後記～
今天的木瓜涼拌實在是太辣了，我要求服務人員幫我調和一下，心想就是再加些木瓜絲啊！
我平時在家也會這麼做。

結果她回我：
剛才妳沒說：妳要小辣。

我說：
這不是妳應該問我嗎？

服務人員⋯⋯⋯

她不知道該怎麼做？

我說：
妳多拿些生菜來吧！我只能拿生菜包木瓜涼拌吃。

有時，我就會忍不住想說出來。。","Eating is the most romantic thing in daily life.

Today's papaya cold mixing is too spicy 🌶️🌶️, the plate of shrimp sauce is also too bitter, it feels like the chef is in a hurry to lunch.

Wheat is good to drink.

Postscript ~
Today's papaya cold mixing is too spicy. I asked the service staff to help me reconcile. I thought it was adding some papaya!
I usually do this at home.

As a result, she returned to me:
You didn't say it just now: You have to be small.

I said:
Isn't that you should ask me?

Service staff ...

She doesn't know what to do?

I said:
Let's take some lettuce!I can only eat lettuce and papaya.

Sometimes, I can't help but want to say it.Essence"
非常道地好吃的泰式料理，泰式河粉非常入味、咖哩系列也都很優秀。店內啤酒選擇多，調酒也有水準，是很適合聚餐的餐廳！,"The very delicious Thai cuisine, the Thai river powder is very delicious, and the curry series is also excellent.There are many beer in the store, and there are also standards for bartending. It is a restaurant that is very suitable for dinner!"
"訂位最早是1中午1：30，店門一直到11：30才會開店，所以不用太早到喔。
現在有做活動，中午12：00前進場都有送一杯啤酒。啤酒好喝。
第一道上來的是蝦醬四季豆，一端上來就有讓人食慾大增的香氣，蝦醬下得很大器，四季豆很嫩沒有旁邊的老絲，很下飯很推薦。
泰式蚵仔煎蛋也是網路評鑑推薦的，只是覺得泰式甜辣醬太多了，變得有點鹹，反而搶了蚵仔的鮮味。上面蠻多的香菜很加分。
芙蓉豆腐肉丸湯，裡面有芹菜跟豆芽菜，清爽的湯可以平衡重味的泰國菜。有點像擔擔麵的湯頭味道，喜歡紅蔥頭調味的人一定會喜歡。
綠咖哩是我最愛的泰式料理，有另外附上一份像糯米飯的口感的飯，只是覺得這次的牛肉有點老，但是泰式綠咖哩就是讚，讓我多吃了一碗飯。
Jolly都有提供白飯及麵包，讓泰式菜餚可以搭配入胃。","The earlier reservation was 1:30 noon, and the store door did not open until 11:30, so don't get too early.
Now there are activities, and a cup of beer is given at 12:00 noon.Beer is delicious.
The first thing is the four seasons of shrimp sauce. There is a fragrance of appetite on one end. The shrimp sauce is very large. The four seasons are tender and there are no old silk next to it. It is recommended for meals.
Thai -style Taipa fried eggs are also recommended by online evaluation, but I feel that there are too many Thai sweet and spicy sauce, which becomes a little salty, but grabbed the umami taste of Taipa.There are quite a lot of coriander on it.
Furong tofu meatball soup, which contains celery and bean sprouts. The refreshing soup can balance the heavy Thai cuisine.It is a bit like the soup taste of the soup, and people who like red shallots will definitely like it.
Green Curry is my favorite Thai cuisine. There is another rice that is attached to the taste of glutinous rice, but I think this time the beef is a bit old, but the Thai green curry is praised. Let me eat a bowl of rice. Essence
Jolly provides rice and bread, so that Thai dishes can be paired with the stomach."

"2023/05
跟 GB 類似的餐酒館，以泰式餐點搭配各式的啤酒。各式的餐點都有特別的南洋風味，連麵包的佐醬都是，真的有趣。

這晚平日來，沒有預訂且已經知道要等客人，餐廳還是很貼心的讓我先入座。整個服務很好，難怪已經開業多年。

餐點稍嫌高價位，但以這樣的服務還是值得的","2023/05
The restaurant similar to GB, with a Thai meal with a variety of beer.All kinds of meals have a special Nanyang flavor. Even the sauce of bread is really interesting.

At this night, I have no booking and I already know that I have to wait for the guests. The restaurant is still very intimate.The whole service is very good, no wonder it has opened for many years.

The meal is a little cost -effective, but it is worthwhile to use this service"
"餐點都不錯，飯煮得很Q，搭配咖喱很棒。
啤酒推薦點Special Brew，是百香果風味的Lager，很清爽好入口，其他Jolly精釀也都滿好喝。
另外想特別謝謝吧台的Ann，服務很好，讓整體用餐體驗提升很多😆","The meal is good, the rice is cooked very, and the curry is great.
Beer recommended Special Brew, which is the latter of passion fruit flavor. It is very refreshing and good. Other Jolly crafts are also delicious.
In addition, thank you for the ANN of the bar, the service is very good, so that the overall dining experience will be improved a lot"
"次次必點這味湯 這裡的餐點非常特別 氣氛也很好
家裡那殺千刀的總是愛帶我來這裡享受二人時光","The meals here must be very particularly atmospheric and good
Those who kill thousands of knives at home always love to take me here to enjoy the two people's time"
公司聚餐來此用晚餐，菜色由福委決定，沒有自主權，也沒辦法自己加點，菜色還行份量不多，內部用餐空間不大不過桌與桌間仍能維持一點距離。服務人員推薦啤酒的說明頗清楚，服務態度佳。,"The company's dinner is here for dinner. The dishes are determined by the Fu Committee. There is no autonomy, and there is no way to add some of them. The dishes are not large. The internal dining space is not much more distance between the table and the table.The description of beer to recommend beer is clear and the service attitude is good."
用餐環境寬敞舒適，泰式蚵仔煎令人驚艷，用餐時段選擇正確還有招待啤酒，整體價位也沒有太貴，每盤餐點份量不算多，相信味道符合多數台灣人口味，整體依舊值得推薦！,"The dining environment is spacious and comfortable, and the Thai Taipa fried is amazing. Choose the correct choice during the meal period and entertain beer. The overall price is not too expensive. Intersection"
"我覺得常常去用餐，有時候推出的活動，想要盛情餐與，卻都被店面一再地婉拒。像照片上母親節的活動，點餐時服務生告知可以使用，也可以一併查詢，使用會員優惠，哪個較為優惠，會提出最佳方案讓客人來使用最好的優惠，結果換了經理出面(不確認是不是經理)，經理告知只能用在加點時，才能享用這個優惠。

這不是第一次碰到諸如此內的刁難，如果店家想要讓客人參與活動，可以直接在活動單上嘗試說清楚，沒有客人會想要為難店家。
如果是加點才能優惠，我是不是可以調整點餐模式，去參與活動呢？

店家熱情邀請，卻又設定暗條件，害怕客人參與，尷尬的互動，感覺不是很好。","I feel that I often go to dine. Sometimes the activities launched, wanting to have love for meals, but have been repeatedly rejected by the store.Like the activity of Mother's Day on the photo, the waiter informed that it can be used or inquired with the service when ordering. Which of which is preferential, which is more favorable, will propose the best solution for guests to use the best discount. (Uncertainty is the manager), the manager informed that it can only enjoy this discount when it can be used only when it is added.

This is not the first time that I have encountered difficulties in this way. If the store wants to let the guests participate in the event, you can try to make it clear on the event list. No guests will want to embarrass the store.
If you can add some discounts, can I adjust the order mode and participate in the event?

The store enthusiastically invited, but also set up dark conditions, afraid of guests to participate, embarrassing interaction, it didn't feel good."
"口味甚好，店內氛圍輕鬆自在，多次與親友相聚於此。

除店家營業時間無法至深夜外，其餘一切都好。
在地用餐十分推薦。","The taste is very good, the atmosphere in the store is relaxed and comfortable with relatives and friends many times.

Except that the store's business time cannot be late at night, everything is good.
It is very recommended to dine on the ground."
"#親子友善餐廳
特別感謝2023/1/14晚間的服務人員，在我們搗蛋的小寶貝打翻了湯碗的時候，即時地、殷切地協助我們清理桌面、兒童椅等等，非常感謝！

在Jolly 的 #西門店 用餐過兩次，對於美味的餐點一直有很好的印象。這一天首次在 #內湖店 嘗試，依然感到相當滿意！

開場一樣會端上熱騰騰的 #烤麵包，搭配泰式風味沾醬。
白飯一樣是吃到飽的，但因為菜實在點太多了（2大1小點了5菜1湯），導致一碗飯都沒能吃完。

除了招牌的各種風味啤酒之外，#鮮搾果汁 真的完全可以滿足攜帶小寶貝上餐廳的父母的需求！

#蝦餅 讓小寶貝愛不釋手，#清炒空心菜 也是完全沒剩下，小寶貝一口接著一口！

最後一提的是本次新菜出爐，#乾煎金鯧魚 真的很有吃年菜的氣氛耶！

整體而言是內湖人可常常到訪的好去處哦！","#Parent -child friendly restaurant

At the beginning, the hot #roasted bread is also paired with Thai -style dipping sauce.
The rice is full, but because there are too many vegetables (2 large, 1 small, 5 dishes and 1 soup), causing a bowl of rice to not finish eating.

In addition to the various flavor beer of the signboard,#除 除 除 can really meet the needs of parents who carry the baby on the restaurant!

整家店的裝潢很明亮、整潔沙發區域很舒適，再來就是特色的多種啤酒，配合泰式料理別有一番風味，餐點都會提供手工生啤飲用，餐點有精緻路線，量不會太多，可以吃多種配合，菜色種類豐富，且味道偏向濃郁香醇，所以搭配酒類一起食用非常適合，必點的就是提拉米蘇含有啤酒香氣，吃起來別有一番滋味。,"The decoration of the entire shop is very bright, the clean sofa area is very comfortable, and then it is a variety of beer of characteristics. With Thai cuisine, there is a flavor. The meal will provide handmade beer drink. The meal has a delicate route. The amount will not be too much. You can eat a variety of cooperations.

"2022/9/18

六點前用餐送250ml啤酒/位，選了皮爾森、淡色愛爾、司陶特，最喜歡司陶特帶有巧克力焦糖甜味，第二喜歡皮爾森較為中和的風味，最後是淡色愛爾最為偏水果酸。

#招牌蝦餅 炸得外酥蘸上酸甜醬，老少咸宜。

#乾炒河粉 撒上隨盤附上甜甜辣辣硬花生，整個畫龍點睛得好吃。

#黃咖哩雞 唯一不辣的咖哩，口味微偏甜，雞肉塊軟嫩，還有熬煮鬆軟的馬鈴薯，盤外附贈麵包條沾著吃，又或配點餐即附的白米飯吃都好吃。

#蝦醬炒高麗菜 高麗菜本質還不錯，蝦醬味道也有出來，鹹度稍微不足。

#綠咖哩椰汁雞肉 與黃咖哩不同的是用較碎小的雞肉片，還有泰國茄子熬煮，綠咖哩偏辣，附糯米飯，店員介紹綠咖哩搭配糯米飯口感更合適，個人覺得搭配白米也好吃。

#烤軟絲沙拉 軟絲份量多香烤味十足，旁邊的沙拉配微酸辣的醬，清爽開胃，但可能需較長時間烤軟絲，這道以為算是前菜開胃菜的沙拉到很後來咖哩都快吃完一盤時才上。

甜點部分大推薦 #黑啤酒提拉米蘇，底層的手指餅乾吸飽了黑啤酒搭上馬斯卡彭，超好吃！

#摩摩喳喳 是泰式餐廳必點，但就是一般般，份量也越來越縮水咯！

店內人員的態度很親切，雖然有些忙碌但都耐心為客人服務，整體用餐感覺很好，唯一美中不足應該是上餐順序有些奇怪，是按照上述介紹的順序上的，沙拉最後上，中間有上了一道咖哩後上炒高麗菜再上咖哩，感覺出菜順序有些隨性，雖然不影響味道，但是建議可以稍微注意一下。","2022/9/18

Give 250ml beer/bit before six o'clock, and chose Pilson, Light Selene, Steett, and Steett with chocolate caramel sweetness. Secondly, I like Pilson's more neutral flavor, and finally light color Alier is the most fruitful acid.

#The signature shrimp cake is fried and dipped in sweet and sour sauce.

#Dry fried river powder is sprinkled with sweet and spicy and hard peanuts with the plate, and the whole dragon is delicious.

#, The taste is slightly sweet, the chicken is soft and tender, and the soft potato is boiled. The bread strips are accompanied by the dish. eat.

#Is not bad. The taste of shrimp sauce is also out, and the saltiness is slightly insufficient.

#Coconut chicken is different from yellow curry. The smaller chicken slices are used, and the Thai eggplant is boiled. The green curry is spicy, and the glutinous rice is attached. White rice is also delicious.

#Baked soft silk salad soft shreds are full of fragrant grilled flavor. The salad next to it with slightly sour sauce, refreshing and appetizing, but it may take a long time to grill soft shred It's almost after eating it.

Part of the dessert is recommended #, the bottom finger biscuits are full of black beer and put on Maskpen, super delicious!

#泰 泰 is a must -have in a Thai restaurant, but it is general, and the weight is getting more and more shrinking!

The attitude of the staff in the store is very cordial. Although I am a bit busy, they are patiently serving the guests. The overall meal feels good. The only disadvantage should be a strange order in the meal. It is in the order of the above introduction. After a curry, stir -fry the Gauli vegetables and then on the curry. It feels that the order of the vegetables is a bit casual. Although it does not affect the taste, it is recommended to pay attention to it."
"整間店氛圍超怪，入座還要報電話+全名？

啤酒味道還可以，只是我已表明我只來喝酒，入座還給我倒了杯水，卻沒給我餐巾紙。

先前有一道豬腳料理是用鐵鍋燉煮的，目前的季節限定菜單《德式豬腳》採用炭火燻烤方式，豬腳先用「司陶特黑啤酒」醃製，烤得外皮酥脆肉質軟嫩，剛好可以佐司陶特啤酒，也是適合多人分享的下酒菜！

最近台灣鬧蛋荒，『泰式蚵仔煎蛋』算是補蛋的好料理，酸酸辣辣的蚵仔煎口味特殊，不同於台式的蚵仔煎，也是佐啤酒的下酒菜！

##2023/2/16
再來回味一下『香茅酥炸魚』！

##2022/8
一般的餐廳很少看見這道『滷烤豬棒腿』料理，口味特殊值得一嚐！

Previously, a pig's foot dishes were stewed with iron pots. The current season limited menu ""German Pig Foot"" uses charcoal smoke to bake. Pig feet are marinated with ""Sittat Black Beer"".

"我覺得味道真的很不錯~
只是就是份量少~價格偏貴~推蝦餅&淡菜！","I think the taste is really good ~
It's just that the portion is small ~ the price is expensive ~ push shrimp cake & light vegetables!"
"位於東湖的Jolly 手工釀啤酒泰食餐廳內湖店，就在民權東路康寧路口隱密的角落裡，不注意的話倒是蠻容易錯過的。

Jolly的特色就是擁有自己的手工釀啤酒 (Craft beer)，並將泰式料理二者結合的餐廳，餐廳整體設計倒是讓消費者感受到溫馨、舒適的環境用餐⋯

Jolly的泰國菜口味還不錯，不過份量倒是都小小份的，不過搭配Jolly自製的手工釀啤酒，用餐時不只有各式各樣的啤酒佐餐，讓各式各樣的啤酒搭配不同口味的泰式料理，更是讓餐酒相得益彰，成就色、香、味具全的個性佳餚 呢⋯⋯","Jolly, located in Donghu Handmade Beer Thai Food Restaurant Neihu Store, is in the corner of Corning Road, Minquan East Road. It is quite easy to miss it if you don't pay attention.

Jolly's feature is to have its own craft beer, and the restaurant combined with Thai cuisine. The overall design of the restaurant is to make consumers feel a warm and comfortable environment.

Jolly's Thai cuisine has a good taste, but the amount is small, but with Jolly's homemade handmade beer, there are not only a variety of beer meals during meals, so that all kinds of beer with different flavors of Thailand The style of cuisine makes the meals complement each other."
"第一次到內湖店用餐，嘗試了許多在慶城店只敢遠觀不敢褻食焉的菜色。涼拌木瓜絲勁辣爽脆，包著生菜食用便有了層次感，兩種截然不同的節理和口感，在你的齒間和舌尖流竄，和被切斷粉碎的花生粒和辣椒塊一同輕舞飛揚。
-
魚餅很好吃，但讓人想起了鹽酥雞攤的甜不辣，至少是精心調味、用心煎烤的甜不辣（吧）？無論配合辣汁或蔬食白醋都是非常開胃的下酒菜。吐司塊是看不見的食量殺手，無聲無息地爬上桌，又靜悄悄地鑽入你食道，沾著咖哩醬一塊接一塊，看見工作人員端著白飯上前，心裡不驚大呼「這是晚餐！不要給我這麼多澱粉！」
-
今天的主菜選了青咖喱雞肉，深呼吸，啊是椰香味，眼前彷彿看見了蔚藍海岸、白浪滔滔、比基尼辣妹，多汁軟嫩的雞肉陪著香噴噴的白米飯，感覺咖喱汁在口中擴散、釋放，一眨眼，盤中飧已盡，撫著微微凸起的飽腹，啊這就是人生啊。今天十五公里又白跑了～","For the first time to eat at the Neihu Store, I tried many dishes that I dare to watch in the Qingcheng Store.Cold papaya is shredded and crispy, and has a sense of layering with lettuce. Two different kinds of differential and taste, flowing between your teeth and the tip of the tongue, and the crushed peanuts and chili pieces together Essence
-
The fish cake is delicious, but it is reminiscent of the sweetness of the salt crispy chicken stall, at least it is carefully seasoned, and the sweetness is not spicy (right)?Both spicy juice or vegetable and white vinegar are very appetizing.Toast block is an invisible diet killer, climbing on the table silently, and quietly drilled into your esophagus, stained with curry sauce one by one, and saw the staff holding the rice step forward, shouting "" This is dinner, don't give me so many starch! ""
-
Today's main cuisine chose green curry chicken, breathing deep, ah, coconut aroma, as if I saw the blue coast, white waves, bikini hot girls, juicy and tender chicken accompanied the fragrant white rice, I felt that the curry sauce spread in the mouth, and the curry juice spread in the mouth. Release, blink, the market has been exhausted, stroking the slightly raised fullness, ah this is life.Fifteen kilometers today, I ran again ~"
"精釀啤酒+泰式料理絕配！

坐吧台剛好先點一杯啤酒開胃一下，吧台服務妹妹超好，馬上來了一杯實在好喝， 相當推薦年度精選New England IPA 跟小麥啤酒。絕對必點的蝦捲(片?)非常配啤酒，而且吃到最後還是很脆，沒試過的話真的一定要試試。這次去點了咖哩雞跟酸辣牛，非常下飯也在水準之上，非常值。五星確定✅","Ferry beer+Thai dishes!

Sitting on the bar just ordering a cup of beer first, the bar service of the sister is super good, and it is really delicious immediately when it comes to a cup. It is quite recommended for the annual New England IPA and wheat beer.Absolutely must -have shrimp roll (piece?) It is very beer, and it is still crispy at the end of it. If you haven't tried it, you must try it.This time I went to order the curry chicken and hot and sour beef, and it was very worthy of the meals.Five -star OK ✅"
環境乾淨廁所也非常乾淨，服務人員都很親切，假日上菜稍微慢了一點點但還在接受範圍，東西好吃連不太敢吃泰國菜的人都可以接受👍👍 …,"The environment is clean to the toilet, and the service staff are very kind. The holidays are a little slower, but they are still accepted. People who do n’t dare to eat Thai food can accept it ..."
經常來的泰式料理餐廳，別家都吃不慣，吃了別家一定又想起jolly的味道，蝦餅、花枝涼拌、綠咖喱雞必點，再來一杯小麥啤酒，滿滿的幸福感,"The Thai -style restaurant that often comes is not used to it at home. If you eat other houses, you must think of Jolly's taste again."
"餐點選擇多樣，服務很棒，環境整潔，座位舒適
朋友聚會喝啤酒的好地方！","The meal has a variety of choices, the service is great, the environment is neat, and the seats are comfortable
A good place for friends to drink beer!"
必點蝦餅，硬軟兩款，梅子醬酸甜開胃，化解蝦餅膩感；隨餐附贈麵包，沾醬濃濃椰奶味；綠咖哩雞肉微辛，十分下飯。,"Must order shrimp cake, two hard soft models, plum sauce sour and appetizing, resolving shrimp cake greasy; accompanied by bread with the meal, the thick coconut milk flavor of the sauce;"
味道吃過當然沒有問題 但是七折外帶價錢 沒想到連份量都大打折？這樣疫情間支持店家外帶 感受非常不佳 不會再消費 請看照片的白飯和中杯飲料比例尺 上面的價錢即使打七折 也覺得到底是貴什麼？？？份量少到沒有價值 而且是都沒有裝滿的喔 請看照片用尺量的！無言 有夠誇張 早知如此根本點瓦城 NARA就好了 Jolly你自己看看你們的產品量CP,"Of course, there is no problem with the taste, but the price of 70 % off has not even thought that even the portion is greatly discounted?In this way, the epidemic supports the store's take -away experience is very poor. If you do n’t consume, please look at the price of the rice and the price of the medium cup drink ratio.IntersectionIntersectionThe portion is so small that there is no value and no full.Speechless enough exaggeration. I know so much. This is the fundamental nara."
"道地的泰國菜！樣樣好吃。
啤酒種類繁多一定要試試
綠咖喱、紅咖喱都記得要吃
服務人員都很好
上菜速度也快
記得最好訂位了再來
是常常客滿的名店","Authentic Thai food!It's delicious.
There are many types of beer, so you must try
Remember to eat green curry and red curry

啤酒好喝，餐點也好吃😋,"Beer is delicious, and the meals are delicious."
"(20181125)假日還是高朋滿座，訂位還是比較保險。
今天用餐的服務很好，客人滿座，服務生很忙但還是掛著微笑。
菜量部份感覺有少了一點，三四百的價格卻吃的很精緻。這次甜點芋泥香蕉很好吃，屬於熱甜點，濃稠的芋泥和些許香蕉塊，入口意外的搭配，但是怕甜的人不適合這口味。

(2016)美味好吃的泰式餐廳。
聚餐小酌都適合。
店內氣氛也不錯。
喜歡坐二樓。
價格和瓦城比起來也不會算太貴。
反而啤酒沒有給我太大的驚豔。","(20181125) Holidays are still full of friends, and the reservation is still more secure.
Today's dining service is very good, the guests are full, the waiter is very busy, but still smiles.
The amount of vegetables feels a little less, but the price of three or four hundred is very delicate.This time the dessert taro puree banana is delicious. It is hot dessert. The thick taro puree and some banana pieces are unexpectedly matched, but people who are afraid of sweetness are not suitable for this taste.

(2016) Delicious Thai restaurant.
Dinner is suitable.
The atmosphere in the store is also good.
Like to sit on the second floor.
The price is not too expensive compared with the tile city.
Instead, beer did not give me much amazing."
"進店一個人都沒有, 要入座不但要給手機號碼, 還要給全名.
好聲問你可不可以只留「姓」, 惡臉的店長馬上兇光的回應說：「不行喔！我們這裡一定要全名！」
不過就吃個飯而已嘛~
要入座還要被審查嗎？
要客人資料也可以客氣點要吧！

這種店算計太多, 果然餐點「稀鬆」平常, 價超所值~","There is no one who enters the store. You must not only give your mobile phone number, but also give the full name.
The good voice asked if you can only leave the ""last name"". The manager of the bad face immediately responded fiercely, ""No! We must have a full name here!""
But just eat a meal ~
Do you want to be reviewed?
You can also ask for the customer information!

There are too many kinds of shops, and it really is ""thin"" for meals, and the price is worth it ~"
餐點好吃但是份量偏少，店內氣氛很好👍啤酒非常好喝！,The meal is delicious but the portion is too small. The atmosphere in the store is very good. Beer is very delicious!
同學聚餐，啤酒好喝！菜色多元，味道不錯，上菜很快！,"Classmates dinner, beer is delicious!The dishes are diverse, the taste is good, and the food is fast!"
從jolly座落在內湖就一直光顧，真的是非常棒的泰式料理餐廳，目前心中第一名的泰式餐廳，個人最愛的是jolly蝦餅跟黑啤酒提拉米蘇❤️,"Since Jolly is located in Neihu, it has been patronizing. It is really a great Thai cuisine restaurant. At present, the first Thai restaurant in my heart. Personally my favorite is Jolly shrimp cake and black beer Tiramisu ❤️"
菜色美味的泰國菜餐廳，有附上餐前麵包，沾醬也很不錯，其他菜色因為忙著吃飯跟聊天通通都沒有拍到。菜色美味程度個人口味覺得很不錯，至於有沒有讓人驚艷，倒是覺得還好。單價都偏中高，其中點的泰式海鮮湯表現平平，是今日最不喜歡的餐點。菜的份量都不太大，因此人多點菜時就要注意了。餐廳內有精釀啤酒，我想這是跟普通的泰國菜餐廳最大不同之處，啤酒有多種口味可以嘗試，今天有嘗試其中三種，每種都有各自特色。！服務員的服務都很好，餐廳環境廁所都很整潔，還有運動賽事的轉播，三五好友相聚聊天也不用太怕會吵到其他人，是間熱熱鬧鬧的餐廳。如果愛吃泰國菜餐廳的人，不妨來試試看。,"The delicious Thai food restaurant is attached to the bread in the meal, and the sauce is also very good. Other dishes have not been taken because they are busy eating and chatting.The deliciousness of the dishes feels very good. As for whether it is amazing, it feels okay.The unit price is high, and the Thai -style seafood soup at the point is mediocre, which is the most disliked meal today.The amount of dishes is not too large, so pay attention when people order more.There are craft beer in the restaurant. I think this is the biggest difference from ordinary Thai cuisine restaurants. Beer has a variety of flavors to try. There are three of them today, each with its own characteristics.IntersectionThe servicemen's services are very good. The restaurant's environment toilets are very neat, and the broadcast of sports events. Do n’t be too afraid to quarrel with other people. It is a lively restaurant.If you love to eat Thai cuisine restaurants, try it."
"不知是不是吧台換人，甜品變差了... 菜色還是有一定水準但好像比以前鹹一點...
#LocalGuides #OnGoogleMaps","I don't know if it ’s a replacement, the desserts are worse ... There is still a certain level of dishes but it seems to be a little salty than before ...
#LocalGuides #Oongooglemaps"
餐點價位不低，口味普通，不過店內氣氛歡樂，適合一群朋友一起來,"The price of the meal is not low, and the taste is ordinary, but the atmosphere in the store is happy, suitable for a group of friends"
雖然這間餐廳是主打手工釀啤酒，但對於料理餐點上是完全不馬虎，這次點了很多食物，一到座位就先送上招待的烤吐司條以及泰式椰奶咖哩，非常的開胃，其中最有印象的是酥炸豬皮，豬皮炸的像餅乾一樣，完全不會油膩再加上蔥段花生以及乾辣椒翻炒，起鍋前在撒上胡椒粉，超級下酒的一道菜，再來炸蝦餅的部分，第一次看到有蝦餅是製作成薯條一樣長條狀的方式，在搭配另一種類似餅乾的蝦餅非常特別，沾上醬料更好吃，最後來說說主角，啤酒，總共有六種啤酒，可以分為苦味，水果香氣，可可香，輕爽不苦澀，麥芽甜味，以及精選啤酒，各人比較喜歡輕爽類型，完全沒有其他對於的香氣及味道，只有淡淡的啤酒味及喝完有一點點的苦澀，適合喜歡爽啤、18天的朋友，整體這間餐廳非常棒，就算不喝酒 純粹吃東西也是非常ok的。,"Although this restaurant is the main handmade beer, it is not sloppy for the cooking meal. This time, I ordered a lot of food. As soon as I arrived, they were given to the entertaining toast and Thai coconut milk curry. A appetizer, the most impressive of which is the fried pig skin. The pig skin fried like a biscuit. It will not be greasy at all, plus the onion segment peanuts and dried chili stir -fry. A dish, the part of the fried shrimp cake, the first time I saw that the shrimp cakes were made of fries and a long strip -like way. It was very special with another cooking shrimp cake. In the end, the protagonist, beer, have six kinds of beer, can be divided into bitter, fruit aroma, cocoa fragrance, light and not bitter, malt sweetness, and selected beer. The other aroma and taste are only a faint beer flavor and a little bitterness after drinking. It is suitable for friends who like cool beer and 18 days. The overall restaurant is great. Even if you don't drink, it is very OK."

今天帶父母一同用餐，因為爸爸使用輪椅，店門一打開，服務妹妹就趕緊過來幫忙，也引導我們入座，總共點了4道菜，都非常合我們胃口，因為中午用餐每人贈一杯啤酒，我因為開車只能小酌，但爸爸直說好喝，服務妹妹從頭到尾態度都非常友善，值得推薦！,"Today I took my parents to dine together, because my father used a wheelchair. As soon as the shop opened, the service sister hurried over to help, and also guided us to take a seat. A total of 4 dishes were ordered, because we gave a cup of beer at noon. I can only drink because I drove, but my father said that it was delicious, and the attitude of serving my sister from beginning to end is very friendly and worth recommending!"
"蠻好吃的～～店員也都人很好喔！
酒精類飲料也多！

餐點每樣都很有味道，小麥啤酒入口滑順、香氣十足，服務態度良好。,"Every meal is very delicious. The wheat beer is smooth, full of aroma, and good service attitude."
啤酒加泰國菜，蠻對味的。晚上6點半以後高朋滿座，坐到吧台吃也不錯👍👍👍。這次點了3種口味的啤酒，下次再點另外三種口味😄😄😄 …,"Beer and Thai food are quite right.After 6:30 in the evening, Gao Peng was full of seats, and sitting on the bar on the bar is also good.This time I ordered 3 flavors of beer, and next time I order the other three flavors 😄😄😄 ..."

看球賽氛圍好，但餐點份量非常小，單價較一般餐館貴一些。,"The atmosphere of watching the game is good, but the meal is very small, and the unit price is more expensive than ordinary restaurants."
"只拍了第一道月亮蝦餅 其他來不及拍就吃光 可惜沒有打拋豬 米飯不是泰國米
有一道什麼醉x牛肉 口味偏酸 不是很好吃
其他都表現很好 泰奶也超好喝","I only took the first moon shrimp cake, but the other time was too late to eat it. Unfortunately, I did n’t throw pigs rice.
There is a drunk X beef taste sour is not very delicious
Others are very good, Thai milk is also super delicious"
餐點不同口味都滿好吃，但份量偏少，價格較貴。酥炸棒腿、雞翅、腰內肉的口感都很好，不會太乾柴，蘸上泰式甜辣醬更好吃。乾炒河粉原味就不錯，配料不少，搭配的佐料是辣椒、花生、砂糖混合的，口味比較偏甜一點，不會太辣，灑進河粉裡拌起來好吃。涼拌海鮮是酸辣口味，比較辣一點，偏重口味很下飯。白飯可以續。小麥啤酒口味最清爽順口。另外兩款淡啤酒比較略有苦味。黑啤酒口味相對重很多，配炸物很適合。用餐環境整體感覺乾淨舒適。,"Different meals are delicious, but the amount is small and the price is more expensive.The taste of fried rod legs, chicken wings, and waist meat is very good. It will not be too dry. It is better to dip the Thai sweet and spicy sauce.The original taste of dry fried river powder is good. There are a lot of ingredients. The condiments are mixed with peppers, peanuts, and granulated sugar. The taste is relatively sweet, and it will not be too spicy.Cold seafood is hot and sour flavor, which is a bit spicy, and the taste is very good.The rice can be continued.The taste of wheat beer is the most refreshing and smooth mouth.The other two light beer are slightly bitter.The taste of black beer is relatively heavy, and it is very suitable for frying.The meal environment feels clean and comfortable as a whole."
疫情期間，外帶的電話裡感覺到滿滿的熱情跟活力，帶回家的滿桌餐點，仍然保持著幾次店裡吃的水準，海鮮的新鮮，味道還是如此迷人，這不給五顆星就說不過去了，保留著和家人朋友聚餐的回憶，Jolly雖然知道這段時間應該很辛苦，但一定要繼續努力，期待再跟家人朋友去你們那，點一桌菜，一排啤酒，開心聚餐哦！請大家也一起支持吧～,"During the epidemic, I felt full of enthusiasm and vitality on the phone call. The full table meal brought home still maintained the level of eating in the store several times. The star can't say that the memories of dinner with their family and friends have been reserved. Although Jolly knows that it should be very hard during this time, we must continue to work hard. I look forward to going to you with my family and friends. Dinner!Please support it too ~"
"節日時的好選擇，推薦辣炒牛、乾燒雞/豬、蝦餅、摸摸渣渣、蝦醬空心菜/高麗菜/四季豆，店內還有各式啤酒供選擇,很推薦家庭聚餐/朋友聚會喔
餐聽內有電視轉播運動賽事，愛看球的朋友可以邊吃邊喝酒看比賽喔🏟️","A good choice during the festival, recommended spicy fried beef, dried chicken/pig, shrimp cake, touch dregs, shrimp sauce spic -gras, Korean cabbage/four seasons bean, and various beer to choose from. I recommend family dinner/friend Oh party
There are TV broadcast sports events in the meal, friends who love to watch the ball can drink while drinking and watching the game 🏟️"
"這家餐廳完全不行。
明明點的是羊小排，上錯菜之後男店員卻說：「經過確認我們確定你們當時點的是牛小排，所以你們要換成羊小排嗎？」
真的是白眼翻到後腦勺，不肯承認疏失還來懷疑客人，最後等了二十五分鐘終於送上正確的羊小排，小小的四根羊小排要價$515，結果味道極柴，肉質很差，品質完全沒有達到價位應有的等級，之後加點的月亮蝦餅又讓我們等了三十分鐘，出餐離奇的慢，焦糖布丁催了三次也還沒來，傻眼，來過三次沒有一次是愉快的用餐經驗，只好給出此評價。","This restaurant is not at all.
Obviously, the sheep's chopping is the sheep, but after the wrong dish, the male clerk said, ""After confirming that we are determined that you are the cow pows ​​at the time, so do you want to change it to the sheep?""
It really turned his eyes to the back of the head. He refused to admit that the negligence came to doubt the guest. Finally, after waiting for 25 minutes, he finally sent the correct sheep row. It was very bad, the quality did not reach the level at all, and then the moon shrimp cake that added some of the moon allowed us to wait for 30 minutes. No time was a pleasant dining experience, so I had to give this evaluation."
"食物美味，
但是女服務生態度很不和善，可能服務業不適合她吧～","Food delicious,
But the ethical attitude of women's service is very unpleasant, maybe the service industry is not suitable for her ~"
"餐點好吃，份量偏少，價位稍高，涼拌海鮮超辣，招架不住。
餐前招待的麵包與沾醬很美味，有加購續點。
白飯好吃且無限供應，還遇到飯還沒煮好所以改提供泰米炒飯～
啤酒的部分各有特色，心得較主觀，不是我們一行人的菜。","The meal is delicious, the portion is too small, the price is slightly higher, and the cold seafood is super spicy.
The bread and dipping sauce entertained before meals are delicious, and there are additional purchases.
The rice is delicious and unlimited, and I still encounter the rice before cooking, so it is changed to provide Tammy fried rice ~
The beer part has its own characteristics and is more subjective. It is not the dish of our group."
啤酒種類眾多，餐點cp直高，加入會員送一杯啤酒or蘇打水,"There are many types of beer, and the cp value of meals is high. Add a member to send a glass of beer or soda water"
菜色好吃  來了四次沒踩過雷  又有啤酒  很適合聚餐,"The dishes are delicious, and I have been thunderous four times. I have beer. It is very suitable for meals."
氣氛熱鬧，服務人員親切，餐點獨到精緻，啤酒好喝,"The atmosphere is lively, the service staff is cordial, the meal is unique and exquisite, the beer is delicious"
"不錯吃
有給試喝不同口味的啤酒

推薦蝦餅","Good food
There are beer for trying different flavors

Recommended shrimp cake"
服務生不論男女態度都很好，出菜快，啤酒也不錯,"The waiter is very good, regardless of the male and female attitude, the dishes are fast, and the beer is also good."
"住家附近， 餐廳天天客滿，菜色多樣，也常常舉辦活動。
但因我們家口味吃得比較清淡，也不喝酒，所以這家只當作偶爾嚐鮮。小貴～","Near the home, the restaurant is full of day, the dishes are diverse, and activities are often held.
But because our family tastes lightly and does not drink alcohol, this one is only adopted occasionally.Xiaogui ~"
"氣氛輕鬆，料理好吃，帶小孩來很ok，有兒童椅，兒童餐具，也有不辣的餐點。
每次去都會看到不少老外，這是一家台灣人或外國人都喜歡的餐廳。","The atmosphere is easy, the cuisine is delicious, it is OK to bring children, there are children's chairs, children's tableware, and not spicy meals.
Every time I go, I will see a lot of foreigners. This is a restaurant that Taiwanese or foreigners like."
"改良式泰式料理，符合台灣人口味。其提拉米蘇為特製做法（蛋糕體以手指餅浸泡黑啤酒而成），推薦嘗試。
餐點、氣氛、服務俱佳，交通也很方便（門口即有公車站，走路五分鐘即捷運站），方便飲酒後乘車。","Improved Thai cuisine is in line with Taiwan's taste.Its Tiramisu is a special method (the cake body is soaked in black beer with a finger cake), and it is recommended to try.
There are good meals, atmosphere, and service, and the transportation is also very convenient (there is a bus station at the door, and the MRT station is walking for five minutes), which is convenient for drinking after drinking."
"菜色有一定水準
服務普普
對面有個小型停車場","There is a certain level of dishes
Serving
There is a small parking lot on the opposite side"
"服務 態度佳，用餐感受舒適
偷偷說 有優惠","Good service attitude, comfortable to meals
Secretly say that there are discounts"
下午6點前入座贈送每人250ml啤酒,Seated before 6 pm to give away 250ml of beer per person
價位高，但是菜餚和啤酒非常美味，座位也很寬敞舒適，很適合聚餐。推薦田園泰檳沙拉，九宮格配料滋味獨特，鮮甜爽脆好吃；醉仙花枝醬汁獨特好吃。不定期更換的期間限定啤酒，也是推薦品項。,"The price is high, but the dishes and beer are very delicious, the seats are also spacious and comfortable, which is very suitable for dinner.It is recommended that rural Thai Penal Salad. The ingredients of Jiugongge are unique, sweet and crispy and delicious; drunk fairy flower branches sauce is unique and delicious.Beer is limited during the period of irregular replacement, and it is also recommended item."
"若有想在餐廳與久未見面的友人大聊特聊的話，請勿必慎重考慮jolly內湖店是否合適？

原因如下

不確定營業時間是否到9:30？
如果是的話，可能需要修正地圖的資訊
當天8:30快9:00就被告知要最後出餐了
原來我吃的是fine dining不是泰式熱炒店
是我誤會了!

店內的氣氛很chill
但是大啤酒支架竟然準備不足
我也是傻眼～
想要多點還不行
需要先將手邊的大啤酒喝完
這種鼓勵顧客節約飲酒的方式
我也是醉了：）

另外，也有啤酒缺貨不足的情況～
啤酒吧台也是早早（9:00）就清洗了

我能夠理解大家想要急著下班的心情⋯
那應該請業主慎重考慮是否要將餐廳開在這個住宅區域？？

這邊可能比較適合簡單細品小酌且有時間壓力短暫聚會的友人們，店家若事先告知兩小時用餐也較無爭議，只抱歉讓日本回來的朋友們，想回味台灣味的期待失望了！","If you want to talk to friends who have not met in the restaurant for a long time, please do not consider whether Jolly Neushu shop is appropriate?

The reason is as follows

Is it uncertain whether the business hours are 9:30?
If so, you may need to modify the information of the map
At 8:30 on the day, I was told that I was going to go out at the last meal
It turns out that I eat Fine Dining is not a Thai hot -fried shop
I misunderstood!

The atmosphere in the store is very chill
But the big beer bracket is not ready
I am also dumbfounded ~
Want to be more, it's okay
You need to finish the big beer at hand first
This way to encourage customers to save drinking
I am drunk too :)

In addition, there is also a situation where beer is short of stock ~
The beer bar is also cleaned early (9:00)

I can understand the mood of everyone who wants to rush get off work ...
So should the owner consider whether you want to open the restaurant in this residential area?Intersection

Friends who may be more suitable here for simple diligence and time pressure and shortcomings. If the store notify two hours in advance, it is more controversial. Sorry for friends who make Japan come back, want to recall the expectations of Taiwan's taste to be disappointed!"
"蝦醬空心菜沒蝦味，空心菜炒的太水太軟⋯
其他就不用說了，很不泰式⋯
用餐空間還算舒服但不好停車。","Shrimp sauce empty cabbage without shrimp flavor, spinning vegetables are too water and too soft ...
Needless to say, it's very unbelievable ...
The dining space is quite comfortable but difficult to stop."
覺得份量有點少，我大概比較喜歡海鮮湯，我覺得甜點的西米露讓我吃到硬硬的顆粒，似乎沒有煮熟...,"I think there are a little bit of share. I probably like seafood soup. I think the Simi Lu of the dessert makes me eat hard particles, and it seems that I have not cooked ..."
"服務員介紹菜單及說明優待項目時
語調急躁顯不耐煩","The waiter introduces the menu and instructions when preferential treatment items
The tone is impatient and impatient"
"口味特殊又非常好吃的泰料，啤酒也很好喝~
每次特殊節日就會跟老公考慮過來吃吃，員工也都非常親切👍
大推蝦餅&蝦醬四季豆&紅咖哩&乾燒豬肉，每次來都必點❤❤
四季豆我的最愛~~","Thai ingredients with special taste and delicious taste, beer is also delicious ~
Each special holiday will consider eating with my husband, and the employees are very kind.
Push shrimp cakes & shrimp sauce four seasons bean & red curry & dried pork, every time you come, you must order ❤❤
Four Seasons Dou's favorite ~~"
你喜歡嚐鮮嗎？可以試試泰式蚵仔煎,Do you like early adopters?You can try Thai -style Taipa fried
好吃的泰國菜，配好喝的啤酒,"Delicious Thai food, with delicious beer"
提拉米蘇最讚❤️啤酒也蠻好喝~米線跟我想像中不一樣🥹🥹🥹,Tiramisu is the best ❤️ Beer is also quite delicious ~ The rice noodles are different from my imagination.
餐點很有特色，跟一般的泰式料理有滿大的不同，口味也喜歡。不過，本來就是為了精釀啤酒去的，結果6款中2款已完售，剩下的4款覺得就招待的皮爾森比較喜歡，雖沒什麼香氣但清爽順暢，真適合夏天飲用，而司陶特的焦香巧克力香明顯，但覺酒體偏薄，淡色艾爾沒有香氣、年度特釀啤酒（百香果）剛入口的果香很快就消失，所以對整體精釀啤酒的表現稍感失望。,"The meal is very distinctive. It is very different from ordinary Thai dishes and likes the taste.However, it was originally for craft beer. As a result, the two of the six models have been sold. The remaining 4 models I think are more entertained. Although there is no aroma but refreshing and smooth, it is really suitable for summer drinking. The special scorching chocolate fragrance is obvious, but the wine is thin, and the light color Al has no aroma, the fruity aroma of the annual special brewing beer (passion fruit) quickly disappears, so the performance of the overall craft beer feels a little disappointed Essence"
好吃! 泰式料理結合西方運動酒吧，沒有像瓦城那樣辣和油，食物再精緻好吃許多！適合朋友們集聚氣氛很好，個人口袋名單之一。價格偏高,"It's delicious! Thai cuisine combined with the Western sports bar. It is not as spicy and oily as Wacheng, and the food is much more delicate and delicious!Suitable for friends to gather atmosphere, one of the lists of personal bags.High price"
"員工態度有大幅的成長空間
服務有夠不行，臉像欠他錢，還不會主動收空盤，是當你們到桌子很大嗎笑死？收空盤四次有三次都是我叫人才來收。聲音語氣也不怎麼好，沒有身為服務業的自覺，連講結帳的口氣也不好，下次不可能會去內用，又沒人拿刀逼你上班。

餐點還行，有好有壞
蝦餅太貴 用一堆廉價零食蝦餅充數
牛小排不好吃還賣那個價格
檸檬蘇打不用點 有夠普基本就雪碧
羊排處理的不錯，河粉、焦糖布丁好吃

氣氛沒什麼好說的，泰式餐館全程美國流行樂，泰國歌確實沒人聽，放輕音樂也好，不然是美式餐館嗎？氣氛也會由店員營造，啊店員爛透了

結論
如果服務好那除去特定品項我會覺得付的錢值得，但那個爛態度我真的想問經理員工有沒有教育過，但今天（感覺像是）管事的態度也不怎麼樣。🙄","Employee attitude has a significant room for growth
The service is enough, and the face is owed to him, and you will not take the initiative to take the initiative. Is it a big laugh when you arrive at the table?I called the talent to collect it four times in four times.The voice is not very good. I do n’t have a consciousness as a service industry. Even the tone of the checkout is not good. I ca n’t use it in the next time, and no one takes you to work with a knife.

The meal is okay, there are good or bad
Shrimp cakes are too expensive to use a bunch of cheap snack shrimp cakes
Niu Xiaolu is not delicious and sells that price
Lemon soda does not need to have enough to be enough to be Sprite
The sheep chops are good for treatment, and the noodles and caramel pudding are delicious

There is nothing to say at the atmosphere. Thai restaurants in the whole process of American pop music. No one is listening to the Thai song. It is good to put light music, otherwise it is an American restaurant?The atmosphere will also be created by the clerk, ah, the clerk is rotten

in conclusion
If the service is good, it will be worthwhile to remove the specific items, but I really want to ask the manager and employees if I have educated it, but today (it feels like) the attitude of management is not good.Bleak"
用餐環境優美、開得晚適合聊天、態度良好專業、JOLLY魚餅285好吃又與一般蝦餅不同、蝦醬四季豆下飯、羅勒雞湯330淡而有味;但芋汁香蕉味道不搭,"The dining environment is beautiful, it is suitable for chatting, good attitude, professional and professional, Jolly fish cake 285 is delicious and different from ordinary shrimp cakes, shrimp sauce four seasons bean rice rice, Lales chicken soup 330 light and taste;"
啤酒還好，但泰菜煮得不錯喔，都很到味,"Beer is okay, but Thai cuisine is cooked well."
"去年12/31選擇在這過30歲生日

The weight is enough, which is very suitable for family and friends to dinner!"
很值得吃的泰國菜!菜色有變化有創新,Very worth eating Thai food! The dishes are changing and innovative
一入座點餐，服務員A跟我們說有贈送一人一杯啤酒，我們有3位先入座，其他2位晚點到，有跟服務員說等其他2位到了在一起上啤酒。餐點都快吃完了，向服務員B詢問贈送的啤酒，服務員B一聽到的反應是12點以前入座才有送啤酒，跟服務員B解釋服務員A跟我們說有贈送，服務員B去確認後，跟我們說有送，只是只能送三杯。謝囉：）,"As soon as I entered the seat, the waiter A told us that there was a gift of one person and one cup of beer. We had 3 seats first, and the other 2 were late. Some of them told the waiter and other two to get beer together.The meal was almost finished. Ask the waiter B to ask the beer he had given. The response the waiter B was heard before he was at 12 o'clock. The beer was given to the waiter B. Tell us to send it, but we can only get three cups.Thanks :)"
蝦餅，涼拌花枝很夠味好吃！,"Shrimp cake, cold flower branches are delicious enough!"
"今天去吃飯的時候，員工說晚上6:15就客滿了，就想帶我們兩個人去離bar很近的地方。我問員工其他位置不可以嗎, 員工說斷然拒絕說不可以.. 然後從別的地方吃飯回來,客人還沒有滿,幾個座位上兩個人在吃飯。好像只是不想給我們位置了吧🥲","When I went to dinner today, the employees said that it was full of 6:15 in the evening, and I wanted to take the two of us to the place where they were very close to BAR.I asked the employees in other places. The employees said that they refused to say no .. Then they came back from other places. The guests were not full, and two people were eating in several seats.I just don’t want to give us a place."
完美！無懈可擊,Perfect!Impeccable
餐點精緻，可惜份量太少,"The meal is exquisite, but unfortunately the portion is too small"
平日中午時間有送啤酒😆 …,There is a beer at noon ...
好吃，特別推薦脆皮芥蘭,"It's delicious, I recommend crispy and kale"
"外帶七折這樣850⋯也少的太可憐
摸摸渣渣這樣一碗77元好誇張
吃這樣真的不如吃瓦城⋯","850 % of the take -out is too poor
It is exaggerated to touch a bowl of 77 yuan like a bowl
It ’s better to eat Wacheng like eating this ..."
餐點都還行，距捷運站近，活動優惠標示不夠明確，第一次去用餐，其他只能說還行,"The meals are okay, close to the MRT station, and the promotion of the event is not clear enough. For the first time to dine, the others can only be said to be okay."
原本吃的時候都還挺開心的，但吃到後面突然說不能攜帶飲料，我在門口，收銀台，或在店裡面的任何地方，都沒有明確的說不能攜帶飲料,"I was quite happy when I was eaten, but I suddenly said that I could not carry drinks after eating. I was at the door, cashier, or anywhere in the store."
"空間小,空調應該是沒開,空氣不好非常悶熱,上菜速度較慢,菜色普普,偏台菜口味","The space is small, the air conditioner should not be turned on, the air is not good, the air is very sultry, the food is slow, the dishes are Pup, and the taste of the dishes"
"餐好吃，啤酒好喝
可惜整家店會一直不斷的提醒用餐時間
但其他比我們早入座的人也都還坐著
甚至沒看到店家有去做同樣的催促行為（是因為其他桌有外國客人嗎？
讓人感到壓迫與匆促","The meal is delicious, the beer is delicious
Unfortunately
But others are still sitting better than us.
I didn't even see that the store had the same urging behavior (is it because other tables have foreign guests?
It makes people feel oppressed and rushed"
感覺份量有變少，但是仍是好吃，適合同事朋友、家庭聚餐，平常日還有附贈酒，多樣化的餐點和酒類選擇，很棒！建議熱門用餐時段要先預約,"It feels that the number is less, but it is still delicious. It is suitable for colleagues, friends, family dinner. There are also wines that are attached to each other. Diversified meals and wine choices are great!It is recommended to make an appointment first"

Compared with the previous dining experience
A little disappointed
Note: Tiramisu later changed the hospitality"
店内空間明亮寬敞，餐點選擇多口味不錯，特色主要以精釀啤酒爲主。,"The space in the store is bright and spacious, and the meal is good to choose the multi -flavor. The characteristics are mainly craft beer."
價格言過其實，許多菜辣度無法調整，小朋友能選擇的不多。用餐環境乾淨明亮。,"The price is too much, many vegetables cannot be adjusted, and children can choose not many.The dining environment is clean and bright."
也許是每個人口味不同吧，感覺香茅酥炸魚沒有很好吃，而椰汁燉雞湯也沒有比羅勒雞湯好喝，不過炭烤牛小排倒是挺鮮嫩多汁的，其他食物也都不錯吃，服務親切環境舒適，整體表現還是挺優的！,"Maybe every human taste is different. It feels that the citrus fried fish is not delicious, and coconut juice stewed chicken soup is not delicious than the Lales chicken soup, but the charcoal grilled beef steak is quite fresh and juicy, and other foods are also good. Eating, the service is comfortable, and the overall performance is still pretty!"

"初二回娘家選了內湖Jolly，點餐前詢問優惠，櫃台說了三種，討論後我們決定用打三劑疫苗者優惠一份餐點3折方案。
服務生來點餐時卻告知要在訂位先講才有，官網寫得很清楚。秉著實事求是精神查了官網，根本沒這樣寫（如附圖）。和服務生反應，又說要加入會員的人就會看到訂位時要先說使用此優惠。我們表達官網沒寫，訂位時沒告知，店內海報也沒說限會員使用。服務生此時祭出殺手鐧說一天優惠10位已經用完了。我們是中午12:30用餐，用完了？如果用完麻煩櫃台將此優惠海報上貼一張今日優惠已用完。
因為不想影響和家人相處心情，也不想再爭取什麼。
餐點很好吃，啤酒好喝。但如果店內舉行的優惠沒有誠意給，請不要推出，或用漏洞百出的藉口拒絕使用，只會弄巧成拙。","In the second day of the second day, she chose Jolly in Neihu. I asked the discount before ordering. The counter said three types. After the discussion, we decided to use a 3 % discount plan for a meal for a meal for a three -dose vaccine.
When the waiter came to order, he informed that it was necessary to talk about the order first, and the official website was clearly written.I found the official website in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and I didn't write this way (as such as the picture).If you want to join the waiter, people who want to join the members will see that when you order, you must use this offer.We did not write the official website, we did not inform when the reservation, and the poster in the store did not say that membership was limited to the use of members.At this time, the waiter sacrificed the killer and said that the 10th offer a day had been used up.We dine at 12:30 noon and use it?If the troublemaking counter is used up, a discount on this offer is used up today.
Because you don't want to affect your mood with your family, and you don't want to fight for anything.

昂貴住宅區道路邊綠化空間位置店租應該不低 現在經營泰式平民美食餐廳 用料調味較偏滇緬台味特色 地理位置佳在民權隧道口大路邊 馬路對面296巷口有露天收費停車場或全聯地下停車位 餐廳空間不大但裝修氛圍傳承之前經營者保持簡單明亮 就是菜單價格偏高！,The rents of the green space location of the expensive residential area should not be low now. The space of the all -underground parking space restaurant is not large but the decoration atmosphere is inherited.
價格較高，蝦餅好吃不過份量不多。料理整體來說其實非常普通。店內不管是音樂或人聲都非常大，適合多人來開心喝酒聚餐，如果是想享受料理會有更好的選擇,"The price is high, and the shrimp cakes are not delicious.Cooking is actually very ordinary as a whole.Whether it is music or vocal in the store, it is suitable for many people to drink and dinner happily. If you want to enjoy cooking, you will have a better choice."
服務好，餐點很不錯吃,Good service and good meals
味道還行份量極少cp值不高，390元的咖喱份量大概比麥當勞大杯玉米湯還少，而且電話上訂的餐跟取的餐會不一樣，出錯率極高。,"The taste is very small. The CP value is not high. The amount of curry of 390 yuan is probably less than the McDonald's large cup of corn soup, and the meals ordered on the phone are different from the meals, and the error rate is extremely high."
份量太少了，吃了個空虛。服務生有很熱情的，也有很冷漠的。加飯加水都叫了兩次才動作，可能真的很忙吧。東西蠻好吃的。,"The portion is too small, and I have eaten empty.The waiter is very enthusiastic and indifferent.After adding rice and water, I was so busy. It may be really busy.The things are pretty delicious."
每道餐點都很讓人滿意，不僅好吃而且有特色，擺盤用心精緻份量也足夠，手工啤酒種類很多，喝酒的人一定能找到適合自己的口味。態度不錯，但是可能生意太好服務速度比較慢，座位稍嫌擁擠一些，價位合理。,"Each meal is very satisfactory. Not only is it delicious but also distinctive. The exquisite weight of the plate is sufficient. There are many types of handmade beer. People who drink can definitely find the taste that suits them.The attitude is good, but the business may be too good for the service speed, the seat is slightly crowded, and the price is reasonable."
東西都蠻好吃的但當天平日晚上很多東西都沒有，主要是當天的服務生給人有點壓迫感 一直鼓催我們點更多拒絕後還是一直建議,"Everything is pretty delicious, but there are no things on weekdays that day, mainly because the waiter that day gives people a bit of oppression. I have been advised after more rejection."
啤酒很順口 炒高麗菜很好吃 白飯是免費的,Beer is very smooth and stir -fried.
"越夜生意越好，六點半還有戶外的座位離開時八點半就整間滿的！
而且還蠻多老外的～可能是可以喝酒店內的氣氛又很不錯吧
雖然不是吃到飽但是有限時兩小時有點小不合理
（會趕人而且點碳烤類會等比較久）
大部分的餐點都還蠻有特色而且味道也很不錯
服務生蠻可愛的還會跟我們聊天推薦他覺得好吃的菜
而且啤酒也好好喝呀～～～真的很適合下班放鬆一下
有聚會的話這裡可以列入考慮了！.....","The better the night business, the better at 6:30 at 6:30 at 6:30!

Most of the meals are quite distinctive and the taste is also very good
The waiter is pretty cute and will chat with us to recommend that he feels delicious dishes
And the beer is also delicious ~~~ It's really suitable for relaxation from get off work
If you have a party, you can consider it here!..."
週日中午一點過去用餐，店家說happy hour有優惠，卻沒事先說使用這項優惠點餐的品項若沒食用完畢無法打包。我們說那給我們塑膠袋或餐盒我們自己處理，店家又很堅持說沒辦法。我覺得點餐的時候事先說明規則那就沒問題，但沒有事先提醒而且一位看起來是主管的嬌小女店員態度非常差，這我們就很無法理解。食物很好吃，但這種服務態度讓人不會想再去第二次。,"At noon at noon on Sunday, the store said that HAPPY HOUR had discounts, but did not say in advance that the item of ordering the preferential order could not be packed if it was not eaten.We said that we handled us plastic bags or lunch boxes ourselves, and the store insisted that there was no way.I think that the rules are explained in advance when ordering meals, but there is no pre -reminder and a petite female clerk who looks like a supervisor is very poor, which we can't understand.The food is delicious, but this service attitude makes people not want to go again."
"內湖店除了位置稍微偏僻一點，沒有停車位之外，
其他跟第一次去的慶城店差不多XD
/
啤酒一樣便宜好喝、
這次喝完篤定比較喜歡他們家的艾爾啤酒，黑啤比較苦一點。
以自家手釀生啤來說真的很便宜又大杯了！

菜色以泰式菜色為主，滿喜歡拼盤的。
但炸魚整隻的刺有點難處理就是了！
這次有另外吃蝦餅跟炭烤雞腿，都很優秀很推薦！
但有辣的菜色大多都滿辣的，很少有溫和口感，不吃辣的要注意！

整體來說是不錯的泰式料理餐酒店，
推愛爾啤酒+蝦餅！
啤酒真的讚，但不吃辣還是不要來喔！
（是真的會辣到拉肚子那種辣XDD）","The Neihu Store except that the location is slightly remote, there is no parking space,
Others are almost XD as the first time I went to Qingcheng Store
/ /
Beer is as cheap and delicious,
After drinking this time, I prefer to like their Alle beer, and the dark beer is more bitter.
It is really cheap and a large cup for my own hand!

The dishes are mainly Thai dishes and are full of platter.
But the whole thorns of fried fish are a bit difficult to deal with it!
This time, there are other shrimp cakes and charcoal grilled chicken legs. They are all excellent and recommended!
But most of the spicy dishes are full of spicy, rarely mild taste, pay attention if you don't eat spicy food!

Overall is a good Thai cuisine restaurant,
Push El beer+shrimp cake!
Beer is really praised, but don't come without spicy food!
(It's really spicy enough to pull the diarrhea. XDD)"
"餐點口味還不錯，
但用餐時被服務生手滑打翻的啤酒潑了一身，
除了當下幫我們換位置外，
餐廳完全沒有任何其他表示。

上菜速度也很怪，
點的湯久到我們以為餐廳忘了做，差點想取消。

二人最後加服務費承惠1800多，
這樣的用餐體驗令人失望。","The taste of the meal is not bad,
However, the beer that the waiter slipped over during the meal was splashed,
In addition to help us change positions,
The restaurant has no other representation at all.

The speed of serving is also very weird,
The point of the order was that we thought that the restaurant had forgotten to do, and almost wanted to cancel.

The two of them finally increased the service fee for more than 1,800,
Such a dining experience is disappointing."
從小吃到大  蝦餅讚讚,Praise from snacks to prawn cakes
太失望了，從來沒有去一家餐廳內用，居然上八道菜全都是涼的，隔壁桌不認識的伯伯直接生氣不吃就走人，然後買單時還是我們自己要跟經理反應，才不情願的刪掉飲料錢，加上給個小小的折扣，可以了解內用剛開放，但如果還沒準備好，那還是先認真的只做外帶外送吧！,"It's too disappointed. I never went to a restaurant in a restaurant. I actually went to the eight dishes all cold. The uncle who did not know the table next door was angry and left without eating. Then when we bought it, we still had to respond to the manager. Delete the drinking money and give a small discount to understand that it is open and open, but if you are not ready, then first take only take -out delivery!"
"口味好 菜色選擇多樣 啤酒種類多且味道有特色 適合朋友聊天小酌
每道菜的量稍少 多人用餐要多點一些","Good taste dishes choose a variety of beer species and special taste, which is suitable for friends to chat and drink
The amount of each dish is a little bit more."
啤酒是好喝的，但調酒味道有點怪。餐點味道都夠，但可能是我們點餐的問題，覺得許多菜色與啤酒其實難搭配。最好吃的竟然是這間店的白米飯......香黏卻又有彈性，與泰式調味的餐點很好搭配。上菜速度不算快，但可以接受，有時候會漏單......我們的調酒單就需要提醒才趕做。,"Beer is delicious, but the sake of bartender is a bit strange.The taste of meals is enough, but it may be the problem of ordering for our order. I feel that many dishes and beer are actually difficult to match.The best one is the white rice in this shop ... It is sticky but elastic, and it is good to match the Thai seasoning meal.The speed of serving is not fast, but it is acceptable, and sometimes it will miss the list ... Our bartending bills need to remind them to rush."
當天來吃還特別推薦新朋友一起來吃，可惜不知道是人多或是如何，餐廳的服務可以說非常的糟糕，一堆重口味的菜上了才跟我們說沒白飯，另外還補一句你們剩一道菜還要等飯嗎？（重點一開始幫忙添半碗飯後就把飯鍋拿走了），老實說這次來之後也不願意再光顧了，餐點好吃可惜服務真的令人失望,"I also recommend new friends to eat together on the same day. Unfortunately, I do n’t know if there are many people or how it is. The service of the restaurant can be said to be very bad. I told us that there is no rice on a pile of heavy taste. Do you have to wait for a meal for a dish?(At the beginning, I helped add a bowl of rice and took the rice cooker away.) Honestly, I was unwilling to patronize after this time. Unfortunately, the meal is delicious."
"今天的菜吃起來，口味都變了
很失望，菜很冷。

牛小排 $1435  很乾肉很柴
上菜也很慢
不知為何還規定八點前要吃完
本來很喜歡這件店，常來還吃到有會員呢！","Today's dishes have changed, the taste has changed
Very disappointed, the dishes are cold.

有帶小孩子去 服務生還有主動問要不要給熱水洗掉部分的辣椒
美中不足是當場辦會員送的禮物卡不能當次使用 希望一個半月內機會再光臨了","Meal delicious

員工都很親切。但是人數很少，看到他們忙到要用跑的。廚房人也不夠吧，上菜時間蠻久的。吧台人也不夠吧，飲料上的很慢。,"Employees are very kind.But the number of people is very small, and they are too busy to run.The kitchen people are not enough, and the food time is quite long.The bar is not enough, the drink is very slow."
"今再去，產品品質很優，Sam的幽默跟優質服務讓我們全家有非常愉快的一晚，給到五顆星!^^

菜色不錯，份量稍少。CP普普。服務員“Sky""很優。因她加顆星。","Go again today, the quality of the product is very good, SAM's humor and high -quality service give our family a very pleasant night, give five stars! ^^

The dishes are good and the portion is slightly small.CP Pop.The waiter ""SKY"" is excellent.Because she adds a star."
泰式口味很特別，有稍微改良調整過，算是創意料理，個人覺得蠻有特色的！手工釀啤酒也很香，可惜我不喝酒，無法給出評價。,"The Thai taste is very special. It has a slight improvement and adjustment. It is a creative dish. I personally feel quite distinctive!Handmade beer is also very fragrant, but unfortunately I do n’t drink and cannot give an evaluation."
口味不錯，難怪滿座，還好有先預定。很少吃甜點，這次嚐鮮，點了芋頭香蕉，濃郁的芋頭香，淡淡的甜，吃來負擔少。,"The taste is good, no wonder the seat is full, but fortunately there are booking first.I rarely eat desserts. This time, you have a taro banana, a strong taro fragrance, a faint sweetness, and less burden."
用餐、外帶幾次，餐點大多不錯，除了咖喱類多偏甜，尤其是瑪莎曼咖喱甜到很難接受，大多菜色份量都偏少，相比瓦城，以這家份量價格比覺得比瓦城還貴,"Most of the meals and take -off, meals are mostly good. Except for curry, it is sweet, especially the Marthaman curry is so sweet that it is difficult to accept. More expensive than the city"

地點位置 環境氣氛皆佳 惟一般泰國街頭大眾食物還不到曼谷餐廳料理階段  食材口味調料很滇緬的台味也可以接受 但價格偏高！,"The location of the location is good. However, the popular food of the streets of Thailand is not yet in the cooking stage of Bangkok's restaurant cooking stage."
"手釀啤酒是一大特色。
泰國菜則是比較“屬於這家的特殊風味”，算改良的現代泰式菜色吧。
清炒時蔬、泰式蝦餅都有這家的專屬特色，若來了，啤酒也可嘗嘗；好不好吃端看個人口味，個人尚覺清淡爽口，不難吃（不難吃就是～算是好吃）。","Hand -brew beer is a major feature.
Thai cuisine is more ""special flavor that belongs to this house"", which is considered a improved modern Thai dish.
When stir -fried vegetables and Thai shrimp cakes have this exclusive characteristic, if it comes, beer can also taste it; good or not to see personal taste, personal feelings are light and refreshing, not difficult to eat (not difficult to eat ~ it is not to eat ~ it is ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered it ~ it is considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered to be a ~ considered it. tasty)."
"涼拌青木瓜盤中有頭髮，這件事難免，但特別跟客人解釋那是蝦子的觸鬚……一般人應該都能分別毛髮跟蝦子觸鬚的差別啦…而且涼拌青木瓜頂多只會放蝦米吧
再來，用餐時在桌上發現蟑螂，服務人員的反應居然是：【好可怕，怎麼會這樣】 我也想知道怎麼會這樣勒……
這兩件事發生後，店家也沒做任何的""意思表示""，身為當了5.6年來的客人，覺得非常失望，尤其是服務人員的素質跟過往有差異。","There is hair in the cold green wood melon plate. This is inevitable, but it is explained to the guests that it is the tentacle of shrimp ... Most people should be the difference between hair and shrimp tentacles, respectively ... and cold green papaya will only put shrimp at most.
Then, the cockroaches were found on the table during dining.
After these two things, the store did not do any ""meaning"". As guests who have been 5.6 years, they felt very disappointed, especially the quality of service staff was different from the past."
"一家人中午至貴餐廳用餐替長輩慶生，吃飽飯後，蛋糕點了蠟燭準備唱生日快樂歌，蠟燭點好後正要唱時，店員突然上來說要結帳，禮貌跟對方表示，我們在慶生，可否等等，她回：「嗯⋯我們要結帳了欸？」蠟燭都點了，突然要結帳，是要等你結帳燃後蠟燭燒完我們剛好不用慶生嗎？

真心不懂這間餐廳到底怎麼教育員工的？急著要結帳午休也不是這樣吧⋯⋯

不會再去！","At noon, the family went to your restaurant to celebrate his elders at noon. After eating a full meal, the cake ordered the candle to sing a happy birthday song. When the candle was died, the clerk suddenly said to check out. Celebrating the birth, can you wait, she returned: ""Well, we are going to check out?"" The candles were ordered, and suddenly I had to check out. We had to wait for the candles to be burned after you fired.

I really don't understand how this restaurant educates employees?It's not like this in a hurry to check out lunch breaks, right?

I won't go again!"
蝦餅炸得酥酥脆脆的好涮嘴，配啤酒超搭。菜的份量都比較精緻，很適合兩人用餐。,"The shrimp cakes are crispy and crispy, and they are superb with beer.The amount of dishes is relatively exquisite, and it is very suitable for two people to dine."
有夠爛，訂位訂了7:30等了半個小時都不能坐下，接這麼多外送單又沒辦法消化人群，每個人都比預定時間多等半小時以上，一堆人在門口等，服務人員又不足，完全沒有好的體驗，它們根本沒有安排動線或是為疫情做出調整，希望有所改進，不然再好吃也不會有回頭客。,"It is bad enough, and I can’t sit down for half an hour after the reservation is booked for half an hour. There are so many outlets and there is no way to digest the crowd. Everyone is more than half an hour than the scheduled time. A bunch of people are at the door at the door. Wait, the service staff is insufficient, and there is no good experience at all. They have not arranged a line or make adjustments to the epidemic at all. I hope that there will be improvement, otherwise it will not be delicious and there will be no return guests."
時尚的泰式餐廳 主打的啤酒口味不錯 餐點口味中上 但那個價格跟份量並不會讓人想常常回訪 用餐空間倒是挺明亮舒適的 除非很久沒去或朋友聚會 不然是家偶爾為之就可以的泰國餐廳,"Fashionable Thai restaurant's main beer taste is good meal, but the price and portion will not make people want to return to visit the dining space, but it is quite bright and comfortable unless you have n’t gone for a long time or a friend ’s party. Thai restaurant"
菜好吃，份量偏小。酒好喝，有新鮮生啤酒。算是泰國跟泰北菜的綜合。咖哩好吃，有咖哩蛋的感覺。整體氣氛很放鬆。,The dishes are delicious and the portion is small.The wine is delicious and has fresh beer.It is considered the comprehensive of Thailand and Thaibei cuisine.The curry is delicious and feels like curry eggs.The overall atmosphere is very relaxed.
"?父親節訂位訂7:30到了7:50都還不能坐下
如果沒辦法負荷請不要一次接這麼多單好嗎
好不好吃都已經不重要了，體驗超差
現場又超多人== 真的不用這樣欸","? Father's Day booking 7:30 to 7:50 can’t sit down
If there is no way to load, please don't pick up so many orders at a time, okay?
It's no longer important, it's not important, the experience is super worse
There are many people at the scene =="
外帶電話你因為忙而漏點的單可以在客人依電話中告知的取餐時間到店後詢問時告訴客人，而不是直接讓人等，等了半小時後，應付完了店裡其他客人，才去實查最後告知一句“抱歉沒點到你的單”,"You can tell the guests when you take the phone that you miss the point because of the busy point because the guest told the shop after the meal was taken to the store, instead of letting people wait for half an hour. Only then did I go to the actual check and told the sentence, ""I'm sorry I didn't click your order"""
超好吃…………我不知道該怎麼形容的那種，氣氛好，酒好，餐點好，服務品質好，絕對會再來吃的那種。,"Super delicious ... I don't know how to describe the kind, the atmosphere, good wine, good meals, good service quality, and definitely the kind of food."
"慶生中跑來要求買單？請她等等，她一付管你要幹麻我就是要結帳了(快付錢)....我們蠟燭都點了，硬要我們結帳，到底這間店的教育訓練出了什麼問題??等顧客吹完蠟燭很困難嗎?等個5分鐘會被主管罵嗎?還是耽誤到你們休息時間??

*11/25更新: 主管打來致歉，有感受到誠意，也承諾會加強人員訓練，先改3星。","Come and ask for paying in the birthday?Ask her to wait, she pays for you to do it. I just have to check out (pay for it) .... We have ordered all the candles, asking us to check out, what exactly what the education and training of this shop did Is it difficult for customers to finish the candle? Wait for 5 minutes to be scolded by the supervisor? Or is it delayed to your rest time ??

*11/25 update: The supervisor came up and apologized, felt sincere, and promised to strengthen personnel training and change 3 stars."
"氣氛好，餐點美味，紅咖哩、涼拌花枝必點，
甜點摩摩渣渣超～好～吃！
服務也都非常好，下次會想再光顧，推薦大家","The atmosphere is good, the meals are delicious, red curry and cold flower branches must be ordered,
Dessert Momo residue is super ~ good ~ eat!
The service is also very good, I will want to patronize again next time, I recommend everyone"
做得那麼不情願；不如不要營業了！請大家別去消費受氣了吧！還有當你去買東西吃；你希望服務人員如此待你嗎？！將心比心！,Do so reluctant; it is better not to do it!Please don't spend it!And when you go to buy something; do you want the service staff to treat you so?IntersectionCompare your heart!
之前都是去吃慶成店，印象一直很好，但內湖店吃起來口味似乎有點差異，服務還是可以的，但不會想再光顧內湖店了，以後還是回去慶成店吃吧~,"I used to eat Qingcheng stores before, and I have been impressive, but the taste of the Neihu Store seems a bit different. The service is still okay, but I do n’t want to visit the Neihu shop anymore. I will go back to Qingcheng shop in the future ~"
"這兒的啤酒選擇多樣。
泰式餐點算是現代改良版。
各種咖哩配料，風味絕佳。","There are diverse beer choices here.
Thai meal is a modern version.
Various curry ingredients are excellent flavor."
"料理美味，提拉米蘇混合著酒香咖啡香超級好吃～
店員真誠親切，是個很棒的用餐經驗：）","Cooking delicious, Tiramisu mixed with wine fragrance coffee fragrance is super delicious ~
The clerk is sincere and kind, is a great dining experience :)"
啤酒是他們的特色，菜份量少，就是一般的泰式料理，想不出難忘的特色菜，也不難吃。,"Beer is their characteristic, and the amount of dishes is small, which is a general Thai cuisine. It is not difficult to think of unforgettable special dishes."
好吃的泰式料理，又有多種飲料跟啤酒，跟朋友看著電視，幫世大運的選手加油，是個很棒的地方！,"The delicious Thai cuisine has a variety of beverages and beer. Watching TV with friends, cheer for the players of the World Universiade, is a great place!"
2月17日中午 我跟朋友去用餐  用餐完畢後結帳 有個矮矮胖胖帶眼的結錯帳 不道歉也不打折 服務態度真的有夠爛,"At noon on February 17th, I went to the meal with my friends to dine and dinner. After checking out, there was a short fat and eye -catching. I did n’t apologize. I did n’t discount the service."
品質一直非常穩定 樣式創新但味道道地的泰國菜 內湖捷運葫洲站少數的好餐廳之一,"Quality has always been very stable in style, but the tasteful taste of the few good restaurants of Hulin MRT Thai Caiye Lake MRT"
"服務親切 價格合理
適合聚會
可惜大桌都是兩人桌併出來的比較不舒適","Careful service
Suitable for gatherings
It's a pity that the big tables are not comfortable from the two tables."
東西份量少 但不錯吃 價位偏高一點 啤酒好喝,East -west is a small amount but a good price is a bit of beer. Beer is delicious
環境很棒也很乾淨，餐點是比較新穎的泰國菜，啤酒也讚讚,"The environment is great and clean, the meal is a relatively novel Thai food, and the beer also praises it."
泰國風味的食物真的很棒，與啤酒搭配得很好。這個週三晚上唯一的瑕疵是我想嘗試的兩種啤酒都沒有了，尤其是桶裝陳釀啤酒！經理包包很棒，但在這些繁忙的夜晚可能需要更多的員工。將返回。,"Thai -flavored food is really great, and it matches beer well.The only flaw on Wednesday night is that the two beer I want to try is gone, especially the barrels of stagnant beer!The manager's bags are great, but more employees may be needed on these busy nights.Will return."

這個地方更像是泰式融合做得很好。我不能說這是正宗的泰國菜，但還是很美味。他們還提供一些精選的生啤酒。絕對是該地區最好的泰國餐廳之一。,"This place is more like a Thai fusion.I can't say that this is an authentic Thai food, but it is still delicious.They also provide some selected raw beer.It is definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the area."
食物又美味又辣。真正的泰國和印度尼西亞風味。但餐桌有點擁擠，食物慢慢被放棄。,"Food is delicious and spicy.Real Thai and Indonesian flavors.But the dining table was a bit crowded, and the food was slowly abandoned."
很棒的泰國菜，很棒的啤酒，晚上 10 點後變成運動酒吧，放鬆的好地方,"A great Thai cuisine, great beer, become a sports bar after 10 pm, a good place to relax"
不是正宗的泰國菜，但非常好。啤酒對我來說很正常，儘管我喜歡他們有各種不同類型啤酒的小杯採樣器。,"Not authentic Thai food, but very good.Beer is normal for me, although I like small cups of small cups of different types of beer."
優質的服務和美味的食物，絕對推薦。但很抱歉，我太享受食物了，大多數時候都忘記拍照了...,"High -quality services and delicious food are absolutely recommended.But I'm sorry, I enjoy food too much, most of the time I forgot to take pictures ..."
去喝了一杯精釀啤酒，小吃很好吃，服務也很好。價格有點高，所以給4分。哈哈,"After drinking a cup of craft beer, the snacks are delicious and the service is very good.The price is a bit high, so give 4 points.Ha ha"
優質的服務和美味的食物。該部分很小。,High -quality service and delicious food.This part is small.
來這裡慶祝我的生日，要求坐在酒吧的空閒座位上，但被告知我們必須坐在預先分配的座位上。總的來說，整個服務都很粗魯。例如，我們要求保留一份菜單，但沒有被允許（對於一個安靜的周一晚上來說很奇怪）。食物還可以，但價格有點高。我推薦街對面的麵條！,"Come here to celebrate my birthday, asking for idle seats in the bar, but was told that we had to sit on the pre -assigned seat.In general, the entire service is rude.For example, we ask for a menu, but it is not allowed (strange for a quiet Monday night).The food is okay, but the price is a bit high.I recommend noodles across the street!"
我喜歡這裡的食物！木瓜沙拉和青牛肉咖哩都很棒。老實說，我沒有嘗試過他們菜單上任何我不喜歡的東西。週末很忙，建議預訂。工作人員可能有點不聽話，我們想點幾杯童貞雞尾酒，他們說不能這麼做，因為他們不知道如何收費。我們建議他們只收取正常價格並將酒精排除在外（對他們來說更多的錢），他們說他們不能這樣做，因為菜單上沒有。除此之外，很棒的體驗已經回來很多次了。,"I like the food here!Papaya salad and green beef curry are great.Honestly, I haven't tried anything I don't like on their menu.The weekend is very busy, it is recommended to book.The staff may be a bit disobedient. We want to order a few cups of virgin cocktails. They said they could not do this because they didn't know how to charge.We suggest that they only charge normal prices and exclude alcohol (more money for them), and they say they cannot do this because they are not on the menu.In addition, the great experience has returned many times."
"我曾經喜歡這個地方，但現在不喜歡了。  對我來說最重要的是客戶服務，這很糟糕。  服務生應該會過來詢問您是否準備好點餐。  我們在那裡的整個過程中都沒有人這樣做或檢查我們。

服務生給我朋友上錯了菜（她是台灣人，說中文，她指著菜單）。  儘管如此，他還是送來了綠咖哩，而不是她點的紅咖哩。

人們都會犯錯，所以我們只是告訴他沒關係，她也可以吃綠咖哩。  但後來，我的咖哩再也沒有出來。  我的朋友此時已經快完成了。  我們查看了收據，發現上面根本沒有它。   我們再次向服務生招手讓他知道。  他說他會解決這個問題，雖然他並不粗魯，但考慮到這已經是他的第二個錯誤，他似乎也沒有真正感到抱歉。

我的朋友現在已經吃完了她的咖哩，我還在等我的到達。  我們再次攔住服務員，讓他知道我們必須盡快回去工作，所以我們需要食物。  他說他會告訴廚師趕快做。  既然這是他的錯，我覺得他一開始就應該這麼做。  食物來了，我甚至沒有時間吃完。  我不會再回去了。","I used to like this place, but I don't like it now.The most important thing for me is customer service, which is bad.The waiter should come over and ask if you are ready to order.No one did this or check us throughout the whole process.

The waiter made my friend the wrong dish (she was Taiwanese, Chinese, and she pointed at the menu).Nevertheless, he gave green curry instead of her red curry.

People make mistakes, so we just tell him that it doesn't matter, she can also eat green curry.But later, my curry never came out again.My friend was almost completed at this time.We checked the receipt and found that there was no one at all.We beckoned to the waiter again to let him know.He said he would solve this problem. Although he was not rude, considering that this was already his second error, he didn't seem to be really sorry.

My friend has eaten her curry now, and I am still waiting for my arrival.We stop the waiter again and let him know that we must go back to work as soon as possible, so we need food.He said he would tell the chef to do it quickly.Since this is his fault, I think he should do this at the beginning.The food is here, so I have no time to eat.I won't go back anymore."
寬敞的空間和美麗的自然光線，食物很美味。然而，他們應該提到在歡樂時光訂購的食物在我們點之前不能拿出來。我認為餐廳禁止顧客帶走食物是沒有意義的，因為這不是你能吃的全部。經理不友善的態度還有待改進。,"The spacious space and beautiful natural light are delicious.However, they should mention that the food ordered food in Happy Time cannot be taken out before we order.I think it is meaningless to ban customers from taking food, because this is not all you can eat.The unfriendly attitude of the manager needs to be improved."
泰式料理好吃,Thai cuisine delicious
該地區享用泰國美食和啤酒的最佳地點。綠咖哩和紅咖哩牛肉一樣令人愉悅。豬頸肉有點硬，但味道很好。我最喜歡的是他們的蘇格蘭啤酒。喜歡來這裡喝這種很難找到的啤酒。,"The region enjoys the best place for Thai food and beer.Green curry is as pleasant as red curry beef.The pork neck meat is a bit hard, but the taste is very good.My favorite is their Scottish beer.I like to come here to drink this kind of beer that is difficult to find."
"餐點好吃，份量不算大（個人偏好這樣，可以多吃幾樣）但價格稍高些
綠咖哩、烤雞串、青木瓜絲都很不錯，啤酒也好喝！","The meal is delicious, the portion is not large (personal preferences, you can eat a few more) but the price is slightly higher
Green curry, grilled chicken skewers, and green papaya shreds are very good, and beer is also good!"

Suitable for family members, friends, and colleagues to eat and drink together
It's not difficult to stop around, but there is a small distance in the parking lot"
雖然是泰國餐廳，但食物並不完全是正宗的泰國菜。  食物還不錯，但份量很小。  可能會有點貴。  建議搭乘地鐵出行，因為附近停車不太方便。,"Although it is a Thai restaurant, food is not completely authentic Thai food.The food is not bad, but the portion is small.It may be a bit expensive.It is recommended to travel to the subway because it is not convenient to park nearby."
美味的食物和非常好的啤酒。服務令人難以置信，浴室很衛生，價格也很值得。不推薦給預算有限的人，但如果您想偶爾享受一下，這裡就是這個地方。,"Delicious food and very good beer.The service is incredible, the bathroom is hygienic and the price is worth it.It is not recommended to people with limited budgets, but if you want to enjoy occasionally, this is the place."
食物很好吃，但是吵鬧的音響效果和令人不愉快的音樂相結合，讓人不舒服。,"The food is delicious, but the noisy sound effect and unpleasant music are uncomfortable."
好的,OK
這些課程真的很棒！,These courses are really great!
很好吃～,Very delicious ~
很棒的精釀啤酒和泰國菜。,Great craft beer and Thai food.
泰國菜確實不錯，但有點貴。它提供很棒的啤酒套餐。團體的好地方。,"Thai food is really good, but a bit expensive.It offers a great beer package.Good place for groups."
"與食物相比，啤酒不錯，雖然食物也不錯，但不太正宗？
仍然是一群人聚餐的好地方","Compared with food, beer is good. Although the food is also good, it is not too authentic?
It's still a good place for a group of people to dinner"
食物的味道確實不錯，啤酒是這個地方的重點。和朋友在這裡閒晃也不錯。,"The taste of food is really good, beer is the focus of this place.It's also good to shake with friends here."
不錯的精釀啤酒和泰國菜。不過，考慮到分量很小，價格有點貴。,"Good craft beer and Thai food.However, considering that the weight is small, the price is a bit expensive."
帶上你的大額信用卡，然後你就可以享受美味正宗的食物和一些可愛的啤酒了。,"Bring your large credit card, and then you can enjoy delicious authentic food and some cute beer."
漂亮的啤酒花園，晚餐後可以吃點小吃和喝杯啤酒,"Beautiful beer garden, you can eat snacks and drink cups of beer after dinner"
您點的每杯生啤酒都附有一盤烤麵包和辣醬。,Each cup of beer you ordered has a plate of grilled bread and hot sauce.
