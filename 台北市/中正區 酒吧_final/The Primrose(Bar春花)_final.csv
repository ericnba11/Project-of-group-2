消費：$2400TWD

位在光華商場附近的小餐酒館
食物的種類還算多元
雖然整體來講食物應該不是其主打的特色
但是還是很適合來這邊吃個幾道菜填飽肚子

至於酒的方面
並沒有酒單
可以依照需求跟酒保服務生視需求幫你調酒
這邊的酒很多是以茶酒為主
並且可以按照你的需求
結合其他的基酒以及口味包含水果，甚至其他的風味來組合出特色調酒

酒的部分還蠻推薦的
但是店家的空間不算大
所以可能需要預先訂位或者是來碰碰運氣囉

⭐️食物方面
👉鴨胸飯 $300
以味道方面其實還不錯，配上幾塊鴨胸
但是份量確實有點太少了
不管是飯的份量或者是鴨胸的份量
大概都不能稱作是一份主食

👉綜合滷味拼盤 $190
滷味拼盤的種類還蠻多的
但可惜口味都蠻沒有特色
吃起來都算是吃同一種滷味味的感覺
份量不算少

👉酥炸雞軟骨 $220
很像路邊鹹酥雞攤販的一份雞軟骨
但當然份量比鹹酥雞攤販的多了一點
不過當然以這個價格還是略高
整體來說就是一份炸雞軟骨

👉風味布丁 $120
個人覺得算是這裡面當天吃到最棒的一份
布丁的甜味剛剛好
不會太硬，也不會太軟

⭐️酒飲部分
當天大概點了四杯調酒
在點餐之前可以先跟服務生表明自己想要的口味
以及酒感需要多重
看似需要水果口味或者是茶的口味都可以選擇

⭐️氣氛部分
這間店分為1樓以及2樓
1樓主要是吧台區
以及有兩到三張的小桌子
2樓的空間就比較大一點
大概有四五張桌子可供比較多的人入座

當然1樓的空間比較狹窄
只是吧台區比較可以與店員互動
整體的感覺氛圍是蠻溫馨的
尤其是店員都很熱情

所以氣氛其實還不錯
看得出來有很多常客會回來光顧
店內的風格也走一個偏昏暗的風格
很適合帶妹子或是朋友來這邊喝一杯

而在吧台區，也可以與旁邊的朋友聊聊天
或者是旁邊的陌生人，也有可能成為你的新朋友呢！

⭐️服務部分
店員都10分的熱情
尤其是調酒師
邊調酒會邊跟你一直喇賽
而且講的話也都蠻好笑的
外場的服務員也非常的熱情
看到你有什麼需要補水或者是收盤子的部分就會馬上過來

⭐️價格部分
以食物來講C P值偏低，所以價格可能是小小小小的略高
至於酒的部分就是台北價格吧～

⭐️位置部分
其實位置非常得好，因為就在捷運站旁邊
如果要是喝醉的話，還可以搭末班的捷運回家
並且在光華商場附近，如果晚上逛完也可以過來喝一杯
附近的吃的也蠻多的
旁邊甚至還有漢堡店

⭐️總體而言
總體而言是一個可以路過經過就來喝一杯的地方
尤其是變成常客的話，感覺還可以跟酒保以及服務生打打鬧鬧討好關係
酒保請shot也是蠻大方的
如果想要喝茶酒系列非常適合來這邊！","General Comment: 🌕🌕🌕🌖🌑
Consumption: $ 2400TWD

Small dining taverns located near Guanghua Mall
The type of food is quite diverse
Although the food should not be the main characteristics as a whole
But it is still very suitable to come here to eat a few dishes to fill the stomach

As for the aspect of wine
No wine list

Many of the wine here are mainly tea wine
You can follow your needs
Combined with other base wines and flavors, including fruits, and even other flavors to combine special bartending

The wine part is quite recommended

⭐️ Food
3 Duck breast rice $ 300
In terms of taste, it is actually good, with a few duck breasts
But the portion is really a bit too little
Whether it is the amount of rice or the weight of the duck breast
It may not be called a staple food

Comprehensive Lifei Platter $ 190
There are quite a lot of types of lovry platter
But unfortunately the taste is quite unique
It tastes like eating the same kind of braised flavor
There is not much portion

软 Crispy fried chicken cartilage $ 220
It's like a chicken cartilage of the salted chicken vendor on the roadside
But of course, the amount is a bit more than the salty crispy chicken vendors
But of course, this price is still slightly higher
Overall is a fried chicken cartilage

$ Flavor Pudding $ 120
Personally, I think it is the best part of the day that day
The sweetness of pudding is just right
It won't be too hard, and it will not be too soft

⭐️ ⭐ 饮 part
About four cups of bartending on the same day
You can show the taste you want before ordering
And the wine feeling requires multiple
It seems that the taste of fruit or the taste of tea can be selected

⭐️ The atmosphere part
This store is divided into the first floor and the 2nd floor
The first floor is mainly the bar area
And two to three small tables
The space on the second floor is relatively large
About four or five tables are available for more people.

Of course, the space on the first floor is relatively narrow
It's just that the bar area can interact with the clerk
The overall feeling atmosphere is quite warm
Especially the clerk is very enthusiastic

So the atmosphere is actually pretty good
It can be seen that many frequent customers will come back to patronize
The style in the store also takes a dim style
Very suitable for bringing girls or friends to come here for a drink

In the bar area, you can also chat with friends next to it
Or a stranger next to it may also be your new friend!

⭐️ Service part
The clerk is enthusiastic about 10 points
Especially bartender
Along with you, I have been racing with you
And the words are quite funny
The waiter in the field is also very enthusiastic
Seeing what you need to replenish or the closing of the market, you will come here immediately

⭐️ The price part
In terms of food, the C p value is low, so the price may be slightly higher
As for the part of the wine, it is the price of Taipei ~

⭐️ location part
In fact, the location is very good, because it is next to the MRT station
If you are drunk, you can also take the MRT in the last class home
And near Guanghua Shopping Mall, if you go shopping at night, you can come over to have a drink
There are quite a lot of food nearby
There is even a burger shop next to it

言️ In general
Overall is a place where you can pass by a drink
Especially when it becomes a frequent visitor, I feel that I can also fight with the wine insurance and waiters to disappointed the relationship
Ask the wine insurance, please shot, it is also quite generous
If you want to drink a tea and wine series, it is very suitable to come here!",False,0.114,0.021,0.865,0.9979
"水果類調酒還可以，茶類調酒太慘了，所謂特調茶的 Negroni，結果酒體很水、尾韻爆苦，一般 Negroni 酒體渾厚且會有 Campari 苦後的回甘、以及琴酒的香氣，整體品飲過程應該要是香氣豐富，且苦甜平衡有前中後段的層次感。但這特調完全沒有，就是喝進去很水，然後苦苦苦苦苦一路下去，沒了。另外點了一杯經典，Morning Glory Fizz，但喝起來像是檸檬或柑橘水，一樣很水很水。

結帳時被問味道如何，我們面露難色，結果調酒師居然酸言酸語說有問題就應該早點下樓來找他，說我們應該拿刀威脅他才對，然後又罵我們為什麼不反映。呃，所以客人有義務一定要反映不然就是客人的錯，然而店家躺著等 feedback 就好？不太確定為什麼會有這種譴責受害者的態度跑出來，我們只是想放鬆喝一杯，錯了嗎？先不論店家並沒有主動來詢問味道感受，外場訓練本身就很有事，同一位服務生剛幫我們點完酒，又再跑來問我們點酒了沒（座位不多，有這麼失憶嗎？）接著又有另一位服務生來問我們點酒了沒……店內空間不大座位不多，建議可以分配外場每人固定負責桌位，應不致於如此金魚腦。

調酒師可能想做點表示，於是說請我們喝 shot，但卻說杯子是熱的，一拿還真的很燙，不論是不是免費請的，一般吧台都會把關自己遞出去的作品吧？熱杯適不適合使用？我想以上很多細節處就可以觀察到為什麼調酒會那麼悲劇。喔對了，我們說 Negroni 尾韻太苦且前中段太水，他居然反駁說一般的 Negroni 更苦。哇，看來是當我們剛滿 18 歲沒去過酒吧是吧？

這家店值得誇獎的是北非烤蛋，很少在台北看得到 Shakshuka，味道很不錯。但為了這個蛋來訪？大可不必。","Fruit bartending is okay. Tea bartending is too miserable. The so -called special tea Negroni, as a result, the wine is very water and the rhyme is bitter. Generally, Negroni has a strong body and there will be Campari. The aroma of wine, the overall drinking process should be rich in aroma, and the bitter and sweet balance has the layered sense of the front, middle and back.But this special tone is completely absent, it is to drink very water, and then go down the way, gone.In addition, I ordered a cup of classic, Morning Glory FIZZ, but it tastes like lemon or citrus, and it is very water.

When asked about the taste at the checkout, we were embarrassed. As a result, the bartender actually went downstairs to come to him early, saying that we should threaten him with a knife, and then scold us why we didn't reflect.Uh, so guests have the obligation to reflect or be the fault of the guests, but the store is lying down and wait for feedback?I'm not sure why there is such a condemnation of the attitude of the victim, we just want to relax a drink, is it wrong?Regardless of whether the store did not take the initiative to ask for the taste, the field training itself was very troublesome. The same waiter just helped us order the wine, and then came to ask us if there were not many seats, is there such amnesia?) Then another waiter asked us if we ordered a drink ... There are not many seats in the store. It is recommended that each person can be fixed to the desk in the field, which should not be so golden fish brain.

The bartender may want to do something, so I said that we asked us to drink Shot, but they said that the cup was hot, and it was really hot. Whether it was free or not, the general table would check the works that we handed out?Is the hot cup suitable for use?I think there are many details of the above details.Oh, right, we say that Negroni's tail rhyme is too bitter and the front and middle are too water. He actually refuted that the average Negroni was even more bitter.Wow, it seems when we have just been at the age of 18, haven't we been to the bar?

"來了春花幾次，一直很喜歡他們家的水果調酒，今天晚上喝了蜜瓜酒，真的是齒頰留香，香瓜的果香和琴酒搭配真的好喝，只是酒量不佳只能喝一杯調酒配烤雞。

N訪，愛沙尼亞出產的琴酒很特別，玫瑰果的香味讓人很驚豔，經典調酒調出新口感，血與沙這杯酒是繼曼哈頓讓我很喜歡的。

食物方面是來春花喝酒時絕對不能錯過，邊喝酒邊吃食物，一個人吃掉2盤也是很Easy的事情。","I have been here a few times, and I have always liked their fruits of fruit. I drank honeydew wine tonight. It is really fragrant to teeth and cheeks. The fruity and piano wine of the melon and the piano wine are really delicious, but the amount of wine is not good. Can drink a glass of bartending with roasted chicken.

N visit, the piano wine produced by Estonia is very special. The fragrance of rose fruit is amazing. The classic bartending is brought up with a new taste. The blood and the sand of the Sausa are that I like it in Manhattan.

"酒沒有特別驚艷，男友說之前兩次來的酒都不錯，所以這種無酒單可能就很看跟bartender的默契，小失望，但很貴是真的

餐點點了擔擔麵，可是配菜感覺很不用心，還超貴

一樓看起來氣氛不錯，但坐二樓的感受很差，沙發區的桌子跟椅子高度不match，用餐體驗差，靠近樓梯的那兩個座位椅子很硬，然後燈光很像家裡書桌檯燈，很不舒服
這次遇到的服務生超級超級不會服務，要收東西前都不問，不想他打擾的時候又一直來，真的要訓練好再來服務，體驗真的很不佳⋯

總而言之，餐點跟酒雖然貴，但沒有到不能接受，只是二樓那個裝潢跟服務跟收的錢實在太不成正比，讓我不會再訪","The wine is not particularly amazing. The boyfriend said that the wine I have come twice before is good, so this kind of wine -free list may look at the tacit understanding with Bartender.

The meal ordered the side, but the side dishes felt very unhappy, and it was super expensive

"春花位於忠孝新生站5號出口旁，捷運交通非常方便。座位數不多。一定要先訂位。氣氛營造的很棒，音樂、裝潢、燈光、佈置，很用心。一樓位置只有靠牆或吧台，二樓的座位有神秘小世界的感覺，洗手間也在二樓。菜單掃描桌上QRCODE 瀏覽，品項不特別多，但很夠選了。而且樣樣精緻，值得品嚐。不給酒單直接跟店員討論喜好後建議你品項，如果點到不滿意的，建議可以多跟店員描述清楚自己的喜好，多多表達不要怕自己好像很難搞，酒一定是會讓你很滿意的，因為它們客製化的能力非常的強。
剝皮辣椒雞釜飯280
雞跟飯都有一個特別味道，不太喜歡。我們剩滿多的，不推薦
紫蘇明太子義大利麵300
醬香濃郁，明太子給很多，風味很好。麵條用扁麵，不是一般義大利麵直麵。調味跟口感都很棒，很推薦

茶-伯爵蘋果350
茶香濃郁，入口也很順，不會太過刺激。很推薦
蓮霧水果酒
柳橙汁的存在感重，喝不太到什麼蓮霧的感覺，像是螺絲起子沒有酒感，上面多了新鮮蓮霧的裝飾。風味很棒，不過和原本期待想像的不一樣。很推薦
桑椹酒
不太酸，也是偏甜風味的水果酒。很推擠

餐點跟酒整體感覺都是非常滿意，會再來也會推薦朋友來。外籍人士的客人滿多的，如果身邊有外籍朋友應該也可以帶來看看，應該會很滿意。希望下次可以遇到桂花金萱布丁","Chunhua is located next to the exit of Zhongxiao Xinsheng Station, and the MRT traffic is very convenient.There are not many seats.Be sure to order the seat first.The atmosphere is great, music, decoration, lighting, layout, very careful.There is only a wall or bar on the first floor.

我覺得給出低於120的都該去跪神明廳懺悔！

食物方面：點了滷味拼盤、鹹豬肉、塔可飯
拼盤滷的很入味不死鹹，辣油超加分！
鹹豬肉味道夠重，但是因為醋以及小黃瓜跟蒜苗，清爽很多，油脂不少也不油膩。
塔可飯也是偏清爽一點，不是很有衝擊力的口味，但是一沒注意差點就把整碗飯吃不見，還好有人阻止我還有第二杯酒。

調酒方面：
第一杯點了一杯芒果鳳梨風味的偏甜調酒，
一開始不太確定是不是因為純果汁還是什麼，隨意上層比較濃厚，喝到後面會比較清爽的收尾，可以很舒服的接續下一杯。
第二杯詢問有沒有什麼特別的調酒，從推薦裡面選了香菜口味，原本期待只要不會不好喝都算合格，沒想到是我今天的最愛，真的很特別，喝完之後喉嚨會有一點辣感，但不會不舒服，很推薦平常調酒喝膩的人試試看。

In terms of food: ordered Payon platter, salted pork, taoco rice
The platter is very delicious, and the spicy oil is super added!
The salty pork tastes heavy enough, but because of vinegar and cucumbers and garlic seedlings, it is much refreshing, and there are many fats and fat.
Tascan is also a bit refreshing. It is not a very impactful taste, but I almost ca n’t eat the whole bowl of rice when I do n’t pay attention. Fortunately, some people stop me from having a second glass of wine.

In terms of bartending:
In the first cup, I ordered a cup of mango pineapple flavor to sober.
It was not sure if it was because of pure fruit juice or something. The upper layer was relatively strong. After drinking it, it would be more refreshing. It can continue to continue the next cup.
The second cup asked if there was any special bartending. I chose the flavor of coriander from the recommendation. Originally, I was expected to be qualified as long as it was not bad. I did not expect it to be my favorite today. There will be a little spicy, but it will not be uncomfortable. It is recommended to try it.

"隱藏在咖啡廳旁的酒吧，第一次去還找不太到，因此神秘感的部分我給10分！

進去店裡後我們四個朋友給了一個一邊沙發，一邊圓沙發的位子，但是因為店裡面滿小的，原則上隔壁桌在說什麼我們都聽得一清二楚。

再來是店員介紹酒品的部分就非常用心，也感覺得出來很認真在為客人服務，這個部分也很讚！
食物的部分我們想吃的都全部點一輪。

接下來是酒的口感的部分，不知道為什麼選到的酒都不太合口味，後來又再陸續點了兩杯，都不是到很喜歡（有點可惜）
但是有品嚐朋友的酒，有些是喜歡的味道，因此可能是自己描述方式沒有和店裡調酒師達成共識。

食物的部分真的非常讚，推薦有來可以點食物試看看，但是重點是！每一個食物的份量都非常少、非常少！
大概就是讓大家塞塞牙縫用的，但是酒吧的食物本來就不是吃飽用的，酒吧食物能做成這樣已經很厲害了！

最後我覺得價位有點高，可以來喝杯小酒體驗氣氛！","Bar hidden next to the cafe, I ca n’t find it for the first time, so I gave 10 points for the mystery!

After entering the store, the four friends gave one sofa on the side of the sofa, but because the shop was full of small, in principle, we could hear everything about what the next table was saying.

Then, the clerk introduced the part of the wine, and felt very seriously serving the guests. This part was also very good!
The food parts we want to eat all the round.

Next is the taste of the wine. I do n’t know why the wine I chosen is not very good. Later, I ordered two cups one after another.
However, some taste of friends, some of them are like, so it may be that the way of describing it has not reached a consensus with the bartender in the store.

The food part is really very good. It is recommended to see the food to try it, but the point is!The amount of each food is very small and very small!
Probably it is for everyone to stuff the teeth, but the food in the bar is not used. The food of the bar can be made like this!

"先說結論，東西非常好吃又便宜，酒反而不是很有亮點。
一坐下來就聽到店員跟隔壁桌講說主要的bartender 不在，應該是去參加調酒比賽了，頓時間覺得可惜，不過酒雖然真的沒有驚艷到，但食物倒是非常高水準。北非烤蛋必點而且可以多加一份麵包，那個sauce非常好搭，另外還點了烤雞和雞軟骨表現都不俗，以這個價位可說是無可挑剔，非常想要食物全部點一輪。
酒的話除了茂谷柑是比較有特色的水果，其他的記憶點真的不太深刻，不難喝但就算很普通。第一輪的酒真的等超過半小時還沒來，東西都快吃完還沒有得喝。
環境的話二樓的兩人沙發位真的是蠻小的，其他還好。

"真的是很隱密的一家2層樓的店，夾在兩家捷運站旁邊的店中間，一個側面的木門(?) ，完全沒招牌🙈。

疫情雖然提供無接觸掃QR code點餐，酒也能在上面客製，但還是會有服務人員過來問你要吃什麼要喝什麼。 餐上的很快，但酒等到餐吃了一半才來，可能餐太快了🤣。時間也是分19-22和22-01兩輪，所以會在食物和酒的last order時間各上來問1次，服務生人也很nice。

預定的座位是2人小沙發配一張小桌，優點是有枕頭可以靠，也可以遮腿遮肚子🤣，缺點就是桌子太小太矮，拍照或是吃東西不太容易。還有就是座位正對面就是多人沙發，那天剛好面對一對熱情的情侶，接下來就是面對面觀賞各種尷尬畫面🙈。

食物方面，鹹豬肉($200)和($200)烤雞都還不錯，而且價格以酒吧餐點而言其實相對便宜。北非烤蛋($280)算特別，但可能自己不愛。

酒放在最後... 真的是個人很主觀的觀點，但我覺得可能因為我們除了他們家的茶酒，客製的都點微濃濃，一個人3杯下去似乎連一杯啤酒的感覺都沒有，走出店外感覺剛剛是不是不是從酒吧出來🙈。

口味部分

伯爵蘋果($350)： 相對有酒感，茶味濃，而且很有那種伯爵的尾韻(?) ，個人還頗喜歡，但朋友似乎不愛🤔

大吉嶺葡萄柚($400)： 茶味也是很有，但偏淡，配相對重口的食物似乎就沒那麼有感覺

(以下都$400）
客製微濃濃玫瑰味： 淡淡的玫瑰香和甜玫瑰花茶的味道，算是很順好喝

客製微濃濃蘭姆底鳳梨芒果味：很濃的一杯現打鳳梨綜合果汁，想喝現打果汁可以點這杯🤔，其實個人比較愛蘭姆酒的味道，但鳳梨變成主角，可能點法要再細述🥲

客製微濃濃百香果味：再加個珍珠就是某手搖飲店的招牌（？🤣

風味奶酒(咖啡味) ：淡淡酒味的冰拿鐵！🤩 其實我蠻愛這杯的(本人咖啡成癮... ) ，算是今日亮點😆（但也是很主觀...

其實雖然沒有到有驚豔的感覺，杯子也很樸實無華，但就是都很順好喝，客製做的不像酒一樣的各種果汁花茶和咖啡，但可能也是點的不夠濃，而且相對主觀，應該還是會二訪補拍吧台🥲 順便喝濃一點或是點其他類型的看看！","It is really a two -story shop, which is sandwiched in the middle of the shop next to the two MRT stations, a wooden door (?) On the side, and there is no signboard at all.

The wine is at the end ... It is really a personally subjective point of view, but I think it may be slightly stronger because of their tea and wine. No, I felt that I just came out of the bar.

Taste part

Earl Apple ($ 350): relatively wine, strong tea, and the rhyme of the count (?), I still like it, but my friends don't seem to like it.

I asked her recommended cocktail, she asked my favorite taste, and then made a cup for me.I told her that I wanted to try a bit special and surprising taste, and there was no taste that I didn't like.The cocktail she tied out is super refreshing, so delicious!

Of course, I also ordered a plate of water chicken as a snack.This snack is super delicious, and it is perfect with wine.The chicken is super tender, and the seasoning is just right, making the whole dining experience richer.
