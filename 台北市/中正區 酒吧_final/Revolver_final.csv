我觀看了三個台灣當地另類搖滾樂團的現場表演。現場音樂場地非常私密 - 可容納大約 50 人（實際上只是一個小房間） - 並且可以近距離接觸現場樂隊。儘管尺寸很小，但音響效果相當好。事實上，它們比大多數兩倍大的地方都要好。我很樂意經常去參加更多這樣的活動。人群大多是20多歲和30多歲。

馬路對面的中正紀念堂看起來很漂亮，晚上燈火通明，為參觀左輪手槍的體驗增添了額外的樂趣。在酒吧過夜後，您可以在廣闊的 CKS 廣場泡一泡。
總的來說，這是一個了解當地音樂場景的好地方。","I often pass this place during the day.I have a chance to visit for the first time tonight.First of all, I like this name.The atmosphere is very real, there are many old -fashioned movie posters.The vegetables they bought from nearby stores are very good.They can add some foods to the menu, it is great.

I watched the live performance of three local rock bands in Taiwan.The on -site music venue is very private -it can accommodate about 50 people (actually just a small room) -and can contact the scene band at close range.Although the size is small, the sound effect is quite good.In fact, they are better than most of them.I am happy to participate in more such activities often.Most of the crowds are in their 20s and 30s.

The Zhongzheng Memorial Hall opposite the road looks very beautiful, and the lights are bright at night, adding additional fun to the experience of visiting the left wheel pistol.After spending overnight in the bar, you can soak in the vast CKS square.

很酷的酒吧，有一群非常時尚的人群，有很多人可以聊天。  他們有很棒的桶裝啤酒，還有一個儲備充足的酒吧，提供最基本的雞尾酒。  一樓有幾個人的座位，二樓有時有 DJ 或現場音樂表演。  如果裡面太滿了，您也可以在戶外享用飲料。   絕對值得一看。,"A cool bar, there is a group of very fashionable people, many people can chat.They have great barrel beer and a bar that is sufficient to provide the most basic cocktail.There are several seats on the first floor, and there are sometimes DJs or live music performances on the second floor.If it is too full, you can also enjoy drinks outdoors.It's definitely worth seeing.",False,0.194,0.0,0.806,0.9217
最近下班後第一次去那裡喝啤酒，但不認為會回去。  工作人員打個招呼，甚至在顧客進來時向他們點頭也沒什麼壞處。  不管怎樣，還有太多其他的選擇來喝杯啤酒來解決這些問題。  他們確實有很多啤酒可供選擇（但只有五種桶裝啤酒）。  他們有 Ballast Point（順便說一句，啤酒非常好），這在亞洲很難找到。,"I went to drink beer for the first time after get off work, but I didn't think I would go back.The staff greeted, and even nodded to them when the customer came in.In any case, there are too many other choices to drink beer to solve these problems.They do have a lot of beer to choose from (but only five barrel beer).They have Ballast Point (by the way, beer is very good), which is difficult to find in Asia.",False,0.105,0.037,0.858,0.7086
我去過這裡一次，看起來是一個不錯的地方，飲料還可以。菜單上沒有什麼真正讓我停下來說哇。這是一個能量相當高的地方，但位置卻非常小。我想如果我想度過一個瘋狂的夜晚，我寧願去其他有更多空間的酒吧。,"I have been here once, it looks like a good place, and the drink is okay.There is nothing to stop me on the menu.This is a place with a high energy, but the location is very small.I think if I want to have a crazy night, I would rather go to other bars with more space.",False,0.133,0.051,0.816,0.2603
調酒師在服務期間在裡面吸煙，而顧客還在外面吸煙（這是正常的），這確實讓我有一個糟糕的經歷，儘管服務相當不錯。  相當令人失望。,"The bartender smokes inside during the service, and the customer is still smoking outside (this is normal). This does give me a bad experience, although the service is quite good.Quite disappointing.",False,0.0,0.194,0.806,-0.7893
老實說，有很多很酷的餐廳和熱炒比這個地方好得多。我個人認為左輪手槍被高估了。它是少數的英國僑民酒吧之一，因此它往往會吸引那些拒絕融入當地人或與當地人交朋友的西方人。到了晚上，它就變成了簡陋的夜總會。我們在加拿大渥太華（我來自那裡）有很多蹩腳的酒吧，所以也許我過於嚴厲了。我有學校裡的好朋友喜歡去，所以我去了公司，但如果你像我一樣，在旅行時傾向於與當地人融合…請避開這個地方。啤酒的價格也是當地價格的三倍左右。與加拿大相比仍然便宜，但與美國或法國等其他國家相比，酒精價格高得離譜。,"Honestly, there are many cool restaurants and hot frying better than this place.I personally think that the left wheel pistol is overvalued.It is one of the few British diaspora bars, so it often attracts Westerners who refuse to integrate into the locals or make friends with locals.In the evening, it became a humble nightclub.We have a lot of barbaries in Ottawa, Canada, so maybe I am too harsh.I have good friends in the school, so I went to the company, but if you are like me, tend to integrate with the locals when traveling ...

工作人員速度很快，即使那裡很忙，但他們不怎麼微笑。精選的啤酒和總是擁擠的地方充滿了外國人和友好的人們。歡樂時光（18:30-21:30）值得一去，台灣生啤酒的價格從130到80TND不等。社交或結識新朋友的好地方。,"The staff is very fast, even if they are busy there, they are not smiling much.Selected beer and crowded places are full of foreigners and friendly people.Happy Time (18: 30-21: 30) is worth a one, and the price of Taiwanese beer raw beer ranges from 130 to 80TND.Social or meet new friends.",False,0.14,0.042,0.818,0.6927

這個地方非常涼爽，通常會有好聽的音樂。我走的時候這裡總是很擁擠。飲料是標準的/沒什麼特別的。我在這裡的一些調酒師身上看到了這種令人不安的歧視。如果我和一群不同種族的人一起去酒吧，我發現我們得到的回應比我和台灣朋友一起去酒吧更快、更有禮貌。就像調酒師都是台灣人，他們因為酒吧裡有另一個台灣人而生氣，所以他們可以無視或對他們粗魯。我在很多地方都看過這種情況，那裡的顧客大多是外國人，這對我來說毫無意義。你並不比別人好，只是因為你會說英語並且在外籍酒吧工作。,"This place is very cool, usually with good music.When I left, I was always crowded.Drinks are standard/nothing special.Some of my bartender here saw this disturbing discrimination.If I go to the bar with a group of people of different races, I find that the response we get is faster and polite than my friends in Taiwan.Just like the bartenders are all Taiwanese.
