"大稻埕街區中容易錯過的隱密小店，要從278巷有槌子的小門進去，進門後走左方樓梯到2樓，看見黑黑通道走到底開門就是了！
只有星期五和六晚上開，加上有點小曲折的位置，光是能喝到店裡的酒就感到有點幸運。
空間不大（吧台4張椅子，加上店內約3~4組雙人座椅），晚上9點之後客人幾乎都是滿的，預先訂位應該是比較好的選擇。
店內有調酒、啤酒等，無酒精的話有汽水（或是請老闆推薦酒精度數低的），對酒單有疑問老闆會細心回答；音樂聲舒服不會過大，比較狹窄溫馨的空間很適合幾個好友聊天小酌。","The hidden shops that are easy to miss in the Dadaocheng District must enter from the small door with a mallet from Lane 278. After entering the door, walk on the left stairs to the second floor.
It only opened on Friday and Saturday, and a bit of a little twists and turns, just being able to drink the wine in the store and feel a little lucky.
There is not much space (4 chairs in the bar, with about 3 to 4 groups of double seats in the store). After 9 o'clock in the evening, the guests are almost full. The pre -order should be a better choice.
There are bartending, beer, etc. in the store. If there is no alcohol, there are soda (or ask the boss to recommend the alcohol content low). If you have any questions about the wine list, the boss will answer carefully; Several friends chat and drink.",False

"根據評論和照片，帶著很高的期望來到這裡。
優點：該社區有其魅力且安靜。酒吧的裝潢舒適溫馨。提供啤酒（Orval，哇！）以及雞尾酒。
缺點：我發現整體體驗自命不凡且缺乏。這家地下酒吧生產西式雞尾酒（我點了一杯老式的），但為我準備的飲料卻很難喝——雞尾酒裡有威士忌、一塊方糖和一兩滴苦味酒。因此，這杯酒的量很小，而且酒精味很重。我建議使用簡單的糖漿來增加飲料的平衡。用於裝飾飲料的檸檬皮看起來貧血。我喝了大約四口就喝完了。當雞尾酒超過 300 美元時相當可笑。
酒保看起來不感興趣，有時會去和她的朋友坐在一起，喝自己的酒。我等了大約 20 分鐘才點第二杯飲料。完全無視的服務。","According to reviews and photos, we came here with high expectations.
Advantages: The community has its charm and quiet.The decoration of the bar is comfortable and warm.Provide beer (ORVAL, wow!) And cocktails.
Disadvantages: I found that the overall experience is extraordinary and lacking.This underground bar produces Western cocktails (I ordered a glass of old -fashioned), but the drink for me is difficult to drink -there are whiskey, a square sugar, and one or two drops of bitter wine in cocktails.Therefore, the amount of wine is small, and the taste of alcohol is very heavy.I recommend using simple syrup to increase the balance of drinks.Lemon skin used for decorative beverages looks anemia.I drank about four mouthfuls and drank it.It was ridiculous when cocktails exceeded $ 300.
Jiu Bao looks not interested, and sometimes go to sit with her friends and drink her wine.I waited for about 20 minutes before I ordered the second cup of drink.Full ignore service.",False
