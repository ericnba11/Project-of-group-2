"2023.01.04 （補評價）晚上
邁泰＄350 長島冰茶＄380

座位不多 跟一些朋友來小酌滿適合的，
店內的燈光和音樂都很有氛圍感。

酒類和加點的肉串點心品質都很不錯，
價格就跟一般酒吧差不多 很好吃～
不過酒吧是開放抽菸的，
當時客人和老闆都在吞雲吐霧，
因為自己跟朋友本身不抽菸所以就沒有久待，
會介意煙味的可能要選擇室外的位置！

整體來說酒類和食物表現都很好，
老闆也很親民，
可以來這邊嘗試看看～","2023.01.04 (Make -up Evaluation) In the evening

"生平第一次寫評論，貢獻給這服務態度真的是我見過史上最爛的一家店
前一天晚上打電話訂位時，一位先生跟我說不限時間後完成訂位，掛完電話不久，另一位店員打給我很多通，於是我看到後馬上回電，他說不好意思 ，剛剛那位先生新來的，我們假日有限時一個半小時，請問能接受嗎？我說我很能接受並表示這也是正常的沒關係，小姐就說好那先生不好意思謝謝你(態度親切很好)一樣幫你定位。
後來我在訂位時間出現，現場滿座，於是就詢問一位戴著毛帽的男服務生說不好意思我有訂位，他說抱歉我這沒有紀錄你要吃就現場排。
我覺得很扯，就再問他我昨天明明有訂位，應該不是跟我說我沒紀錄請現場排吧，我沒訂位也不會跟你在這邊坳?
於是最扯的事情發生了，那毛帽兄不斷回我""不是我接的，接電話的是我嗎？昨天又不是我接的，我這邊就是沒紀錄，現在就是客滿要吃請排隊就這樣""然後又說""先生你態度也不好""聽到他不斷這樣鬼打牆的回答我也醉了，我也沒大聲跟他揮，也是心平氣和跟他說，難道發生這種事情誰會笑笑說好沒關係你繼續忙，客人會打電話訂位，難道要先指定服務生? 心想這位毛帽兄是不是頭悶到了，撇責一流，我也當過服務生，也知道服務生的辛苦，更不可能有""客人至上""的心態。
隨後我把手機對話紀錄給他看，上面明顯顯示通話紀錄，他還是一直跟我說那也不是我打的，後來我問他是不是店長，好險他回答不是，問店長在哪一直說不在，然後說我們客人很多你要吃就排隊，之後的狀況也不重要，其實他真的一開始簡單說個不好意思我相信以台灣人有八成都能接受也不會刁難。
這家店或許有特色，餐點或許好吃，但評論過低不是沒原因，我不知道老闆是誰，我只知道再多用幾個這種員工遲早倒閉，這種服務態度我真的是不敢領教，生平第一次評論就獻給這位94狂的毛帽兄。","For the first time in my life, I wrote a comment and contributed to this service attitude. I have really seen the worst shop in history.
When I called the reservation the night before, a gentleman told me that I completed the reservation after the unlimited time. Soon after hanging up the phone, the other clerk called me a lot, so I immediately called back after seeing it. He said he was embarrassed. Just now, the gentleman is new, and we have a limited time for one and a half hours. Can I accept it?I said that I can accept and say that this is normal. The lady said that my husband is embarrassed. Thank you for helping you.
Later, I appeared at the booking time, and the scene was full, so I asked a male waiter wearing a hairy hat and said I was embarrassed. I said that I was sorry that I had no record.
I think it ’s very tumbling, so I asked him again yesterday. I had a reservation yesterday. It should not be told me that I did n’t record that I did n’t record the scene.
So what happened to the most happened. Brother Mao Hao kept returning to me. ""It wasn't me who answered me, was it me who answered the phone? Yesterday, I didn’t pick it up. I have no record on my side. That's it. ""Then I said,"" Sir, your attitude is not good. ""I heard that he was drunk and I didn't wave loudly. With a smile, it's okay. You continue to be busy. The guests will call to order. Do you want to designate the waiter first? Watching this hairy brother is stuffy and blame. I have also been a waiter and knows the service of the service. The hard work of life is even more impossible to have the mentality of ""guest first"".
Then I showed him the record of the mobile phone dialogue. The call record was clearly displayed above. He still told me that it was not me. Later, I asked him if he was the manager, and he answered that he did not answer. If you are not, then say that if you eat a lot of our guests, you can queue up, and the situation is not important. In fact, he really simply said that I was embarrassed at first I believe that I believe that eight Chengdu in Taiwanese can accept it.
This shop may be distinctive, and the meal may be delicious, but the comment is too low. I don’t know who the boss is. I only know that I will use a few more employees sooner or later.

這個地方改變了名稱，也許所有權也改變了。啤酒不錯，但服務很差。食物來自旁邊的日本餐廳。一段時間後我試著點燒烤但從未來過。調酒師正忙著和他的朋友一起為我們提供服務……下次我去那家日本餐廳時，已經客滿了，一切看起來都很棒。,"This place has changed the name, and maybe the ownership has also changed.Beer is good, but the service is poor.Food comes from the Japanese restaurant next to it.After a period of time, I tried to barbecue but never future.The bartender is busy providing us with his friends ... Next time I went to that Japanese restaurant, I was full, and everything looked great.",False,0.164,0.0,0.836,0.9144
烹飪區前面的一排椅子旁邊的濃縮咖啡機下面有一層老鼠糞便。我很尷尬，跟服務生說了，他知道了。仍然讓我為我訂購的茶付錢。這個地方髒得令人作嘔。看看地板上覆蓋著尚未擦拭的髒液體，例如茶和咖啡。如果你不擦拭表面，我不想知道你的冰箱或烹飪表面是什麼樣子。我害怕喝茶會生病。提防。 小心，非常不乾淨。,"There is a layer of mouse feces under the concentrated coffee machine in front of a chair in front of the cooking area.I was embarrassed and told the waiter, he knew.I still pay me for the tea I ordered.This place is dirty.Take a look at the dirty liquid covered on the floor, such as tea and coffee.If you don't wipe the surface, I don't want to know what your refrigerator or cooking surface looks like.I am afraid that drinking tea will get sick.beware.Be careful, very unclean.",False,0.018,0.089,0.894,-0.6621
友善的服務。無趣的早午餐，原料是商店買的。有趣的裝飾，但很髒。角落和廚房架子上有一層灰塵。確認囓齒動物掉落在濃縮咖啡機下方和收銀機旁的櫃檯上。,"Friendly service.Bothonal brunch, raw materials were bought by the store.Interesting decoration, but dirty.There is a layer of dust on the corner and kitchen rack.Confirm that the rodent is dropped under the counter under the concentrated coffee machine and next to the cash register.",False,0.048,0.0,0.952,0.2732
早午餐和三明治很簡單，但美味又新鮮。座位不多，但絕對是中山地鐵站附近週末清晨放鬆的舒適場所。,"Bunch and sandwich are simple, but delicious and fresh.There are not many seats, but it is definitely a comfortable place for relaxation in the morning near Zhongshan Metro Station.",False,0.414,0.0,0.586,0.962
"完美的小咖啡館，適合吃午餐或一頓飯。歐陸式美式午餐（培根、香腸、沙拉、蛋捲等）但菜色並不平淡，都是精心準備的。氣氛平靜。咖啡館俯瞰相當安靜的街道。各種音樂，但不是像其他地方那樣的電子音樂。
唯一的缺點：菜單是中文的，但透過使用已經提供的菜餚作為範例很容易找到。","The perfect small cafe is suitable for lunch or a meal.European -style American lunches (bacon, sausage, salad, egg rolls, etc.), but the dishes are not plain, they are carefully prepared.The atmosphere is calm.The cafe overlooks quite quiet streets.Various music, but not electronic music like other places.

天哪，這是世界上最慢的服務。我的普通果醬吐司怎麼可能要花快一個小時才能做好。工作人員看起來不想工作。總之就是很可愛...,"God, this is the slowest service in the world.How can my ordinary jam toast take an hour to do well.The staff does not want to work.In short, it's very cute ...",False,0.156,0.035,0.809,0.6335
小而舒適的咖啡館。由於天氣原因，有點悶。但全天的早餐很好。抹茶拿鐵也很好吃。對蘋果汁有點失望。以為是鮮榨的而不是瓶子裡的。,"Small and comfortable cafes.Due to the weather, a bit stuffy.But the breakfast throughout the day is good.Matcha latte is also delicious.A little disappointed with apple juice.I thought it was freshly squeezed rather than in the bottle.",False,0.082,0.07,0.848,0.1263
