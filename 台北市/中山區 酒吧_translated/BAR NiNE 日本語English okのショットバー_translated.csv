"有人情味的日式酒吧！
店內日本客人居多，提供酒和無酒精飲料，無酒精飲料比一般酒吧選項更多。
唯一缺點是店內煙味偏重，非常怕煙味的人要注意⚠️","Anyone Japanese -style bar!
Most of the Japanese guests in the store provide wine and alcoholic drinks. There are more alcoholic drinks than ordinary bar options.
The only disadvantage is that the smell of smoke in the store is very important, and people who are very afraid of smoke should pay attention ⚠️"
"高年份IB及原酒不少，在條通要經營這樣的店不容易，看得出有試著找出平衡點。
還有一顆星的進步空間是希望業主能讓底下員工參加品酒會或是邀請專家幫員工上課（比如你們合作的虎哥），畢竟有系統性地累積味覺經驗才能更準確地介紹威士忌風味類別，員工看得出都很上進，但以她們的年紀及經濟能力要自主累積味覺記憶實在太難了。At last, for those Japanese customers, please respect these young servers and do not violate their will to touch them disgracefully.","There are a lot of high -year IB and original wine. It is not easy to operate such a store in List. It can be seen that it tries to find a balance point.
There is also a stars' progressive space to hope that the owner can allow employees to attend a wine tasting or invite experts to help employees (such as the tiger brother you cooperate). Employees can see very much, but it is too difficult to accumulate taste memory with their age and economic ability.At last, for this japanese customers, please respect the young servers and do not violate their will to touch them disgracefully."
"其實喝酒價位跟外面差不多啦，雖然煙味很重不太喜歡，但是在廁所裡面也有香香的衣服噴噴莫名的對女生很友善！

除此之外一個人來也不用擔心怕怕的或是無聊，因為服務人員都是女生，覺得很彆扭也可以跟他們聊聊，大家的故事也都很好玩","In fact, the price of drinking is almost the same as the outside. Although the smell of smoke is very heavy, I don't like it, but there are also fragrant clothes in the toilet that are inexplicably friendly to girls!

In addition, you don't have to worry about fear or boring, because the service staff are girls, and they can talk to them if they feel awkward. Everyone’s story is also fun"
謝謝店員們很親切的招呼聊天❤️在臺灣也能體驗浴衣文化！了解到浴衣文化與品酒的知識🥰推薦大家來玩 …,"Thank you, the clerks are very kind to say hello to chat ❤️ You can also experience bathrobe culture in Taiwan!Knowing the knowledge of yukata culture and wine tasting 🥰 Recommend everyone to play ..."
服務生都超健談 氣氛又很好,The waiters are super good at the atmosphere and very good
來這邊要小心生命之水小公主，氣氛會太嗨...,"Come here to be careful of the little princess of life, the atmosphere will be too hi ..."
環境還算不錯，店員也算好聊，美中不足的是以為是日式酒店比較安靜些，造訪當日，有夠吵雜不輸台式卡啦ok店～,The environment is pretty good. The clerk is also good. The disadvantage is that it is relatively quieter in Japanese -style hotels.
消費便宜，服務人員態度親切。多種語言方便。餅乾好吃，酒水不貴。,"Consumption is cheap, and the service staff attitude is cordial.Multiple languages ​​are convenient.The biscuits are delicious and the wine is not expensive."
威士忌的種類非常專業，調酒好喝且平價，而且店員都非常的親切，值得再訪的店,"The types of whiskey are very professional, the bartending is delicious and cheap, and the clerk is very kind. It is worth visiting the shop."

They also have a Bar Nine VIP. They pay attention to privacy. They are very suitable for entertaining Japanese guests!"
我現在頭暈不是因為喝酒，是因為Luri跟Hina還在我心中,"I am dizzy because I drink alcohol, because Luri and Hina are still in my heart"
"1/31去，環境跟酒質都還算合格
只是服務人員可能太年輕，太不會正確聊天，交際手腕及服務客戶的經驗有待加強。","1/31去，環境跟酒質都還算合格

啤酒選擇少，調酒的酒精感稍弱，室內座位空間還算舒適，服務人員熱情友善,"There are fewer beer selection, the alcoholics of bartender is slightly weaker, the room space of the indoor seat is quite comfortable, the service staff is warm and friendly"
"可以很放鬆的酒吧
大家都好友善","Bar that can be relaxed

我喝了很多威士忌

這是一家我絕對想再次光顧的商店。","This is a great bar, with friendly employees and thoughtful service.
I drank a lot of whiskey
You can taste a variety of alcoholic beverages such as Taiwan whiskey, Japanese whiskey, and Scotch whiskey.
Maybe because there are many Japanese here, but I am surprised that the staff of the staff is very good.

名叫小光的天才。有一個女孩日語說得很好，我以為她會的。然而，有一位名叫傑瑞的男性顧客參與其中。其他店的女孩和顧客的日語都說得很好，所以整體來說很有趣。日本顧客很多，可以放心喝。其實整個城市都是日本人，感覺就像是日本地方城市，所以不會有身處異國的感覺。,"The genius name is Xiaoguang.There is a girl who speaks well in Japanese, and I think she will.However, a male customer named Jerry participated in it.The girls and customers in other stores are very good, so it is very interesting as a whole.There are many Japanese customers and can rest assured.In fact, the entire city is Japanese, and it feels like a local city in Japan, so there will be no feeling of being in a foreign country."

考慮到價格和差價，比日本便宜。

我是一個人去的，但是很滿意，也有人組團來的，所以我想兩種情況都可以享受。

允許吸煙。

店外附近有很多拉皮條的女士，所以要小心。","This is a girl's bar in Taipei.
Girls are also energetic, clever and interesting.
Since this is a Japanese bar, Japanese can be used throughout the process.
There are people who understand Japanese and are still learning.

Considering the price and difference, it is cheaper than Japan.

I went alone, but I was very satisfied, and some people came to group, so I think both situations can be enjoyed.

Smoking.

There are many ladies who pull pimp bars outside the store, so be careful."
大部分店員都會說日語。非常友好和賓至如歸的感覺。價格是日本價格，但可以理解。最低收費為500TWD，因此西方客戶數量可能較少。,大部分店員都會說日語。非常友好和賓至如歸的感覺。價格是日本價格，但可以理解。最低收費為500TWD，因此西方客戶數量可能較少。
對於漫長的工作日來說，這是一個非常愉快的地方，有很多飲料選擇，工作人員很友好，女孩們願意提供幫助，您可以與她們進行愉快的交談。酒吧裡的女孩大多會說日語、台語和普通話。台北最好的酒吧之一。如果你想喝個痛快，記得帶足夠的錢，因為這個地方不適合膽怯的人！,"For a long working day, this is a very pleasant place.

"您可以單獨飲用。價格也很合理。
有很多會說日語的工作人員，這很有幫助。","You can drink alone.The price is also reasonable.
There are many staff who speak Japanese, which is very helpful."
有人稱之為“女孩酒吧”，但其實這是一家說日語的酒吧。不像日本的女生酒吧，價格還算合理，就算喝很久，我想也是1500、1800元一個人吧。對我來說，這是一家便宜又安全的商店。,"Some people call it a ""girl bar"", but in fact this is a Japanese bar.Unlike a Japanese girl bar, the price is quite reasonable. Even for a long time, I think it is 1500 and 1800 yuan.For me, this is a cheap and safe store."
非常好玩的酒吧！工作人員很健談，很友善，飲料並不令人驚嘆，但完全可以接受。他們還提供遊戲，工作人員會講多種語言。,"Very fun bar!The staff is very talkative, friendly, and the drink is not amazing, but it is completely acceptable.They also provide games, and staff will speak a variety of languages."

很棒的酒吧，有細心的工作人員和創意飲料。不像一些評論所說的那麼吵。絕對是台北的一個常規酒吧。,"A great bar, careful staff and creative drinks.Not as noisy as some comments say.It is definitely a regular bar in Taipei."

"網路上寫著是日本人開的，但其實只是一家普通的女生酒吧。

我能聽懂日語，所以可以進行對話。

我的英語也很流利。","It is said on the Internet that it was opened by the Japanese, but it was actually just an ordinary girl bar.

I can understand Japanese, so I can make a conversation.

My English is also fluent."
很棒的調酒師。我不會說中文（我會說韓語、英語和西班牙語），但他們會說英語並且非常樂於助人。如果我回到台灣，我一定會回來這裡喝一杯,"Great bartender.I don't speak Chinese (I can speak Korean, English, and Spanish), but they can speak English and are very helpful.If I return to Taiwan, I will definitely come back here for a drink"

雞尾酒不夠好，不足以證明高價的合理性。環境還可以，但不會讓你想留下來。,"Cocktails are not good enough to prove the rationality of high prices.The environment is okay, but it won't let you want to stay."
這是一家日本人友好的酒吧，即使是一個人也可以隨意前往。,"This is a Japanese friendly bar, and even a person can go at will."
