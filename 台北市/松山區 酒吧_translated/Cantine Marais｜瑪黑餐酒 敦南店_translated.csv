那這一家位於東區巷弄內的異國料理餐廳
基本上也是可以使用線上inline訂位

可以線上訂位的店家我都先給他加10分啊！
那這一間異國料理他的菜單內容其實很豐富～
應該算是各種歐陸的料理都略有涉獵～

另外如果要喝酒的朋友們也可以點裡面的調酒
那如果是當天不喝酒也是有其他的氣泡飲或者是軟性飲料可以選擇

店內的裝潢擺設以及氣氛也是還不錯～
不過他不算是完全的餐酒館
比較算是小餐館配上一些酒飲這樣子

食物：🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑
酒飲：N/A

⭐️食物部分
金沙地瓜炸雞
這一個炸雞聽說也是店內的招牌菜
那上面過了許多的金沙地瓜粉
配上裡面炸的炸雞這個樣子
這道菜我覺得是還OK的

外面的金沙地瓜粉裹得還不錯
包覆著裡面的炸雞
整體來說蠻加分的！

那其餘的食物我個人覺得也是蠻推薦的
尤其是這邊比較知名的包含燉飯或者是麵類
我個人都相當推薦可以去點一下

那因為他的前菜品項也是非常的多
就看當天各位朋友們想要選擇吃什麼試試看嘍！

那主要在餐點的部分
我覺得大部分都是水準之上
並且以他的擺盤還有食物表現程度我覺得是還蠻好看的～

所以整體來說拍照也是會拍得不錯
非常適合朋友們菜都上齊了一起來拍照！

⭐️酒飲部分
當天因為沒有要打算喝酒
所以當天並沒有點任何飲料
因此這部分沒辦法評價囉🥹🥹

⭐️氣氛部分
店內的空間其實不算非常大
那因此桌椅桌之間的間距也是蠻近的
因此如果當天有其他桌的客人比較吵雜的話
有可能就會影響到我們用餐的感覺

那店內的椅子以及桌子
我是覺得如果你是坐在外面的桌子區
那椅子和桌子的舒適度可能就有所差異了

畢竟當天我和朋友是坐在沙發區
沙發區的部分我就覺得還不錯
空間也蠻大舒適
但是座位區的椅子可能看起來就沒有這麼舒適了😂

店內的氣氛其實蠻適合約會的
而且走一個優雅輕鬆的感覺
但是前提是其他桌子的客人不會太吵🥹

⭐️服務部分
印象中當天沒有什麼特別的服務
就是非常基本的點餐送餐等等
那當然服務生在送菜的時候
依然是會稍微介紹一下每道菜的特色
這部分就是基本的～

⭐️價格部分
那以這間店來說
他的每道菜色其實單價都不算低
以前菜開胃菜來講
有些的單價就已經直逼其他一般外面的主食價格了

並且因為這間店的份量也不算太多
主要還是走一個精緻以及觀賞的路線
食物當然本體還算是美味

但是搭配這個價格就是有點稍稍的略高

⭐️位置部分
那這間餐廳位於東區的巷弄之中
也是非常適合在下午晚上逛完附近的東區小店
前來轉場到這邊約會
那因為附近也是非常多的店家或者是吃的餐廳
因此位置部分我是覺得相當不錯

畢竟東區不管是公車或者是捷運大眾運輸交通工具都是很方便的！

⭐️總體而言
我覺得這一間歐陸餐廳
他的許多食物都是還蠻美味，並且可看性極高
那店內的氣氛也是相當不錯
非常適合約會
但前提是我是覺得需要預定到沙發區會更適合

如果對於各式各樣小餐館或者是小酒館料理有興趣的朋友們
這間店也是非常適合前來
整體來說不會到非常高價
但我覺得就是中高價位的餐廳了！

不過以約會的CP值來講我覺得還算高
可以兩個人點個兩個主餐兩個開胃菜
再看看當天需不需要喝點小酒

這樣子應該$2000內可以解決
如果有興趣的朋友們還是可以來這邊試試看喔！","General Comment: 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑
Price: 1600 $
Visiting Date: 2023/07/14

Then this exotic restaurant in the alley in the East District
Basically, you can use online inline reservation

I can give him 10 points for the stores that can book online!
Then this exotic dish's menu content is actually very rich ~
It should be regarded as a variety of European cuisine.

In addition, friends who want to drink can also order the bartender inside
If you do n’t drink that day, you have other bubbles or soft drinks to choose from

The decoration and atmosphere in the store are also pretty good ~
But he is not a complete dining tavern
It's more small restaurant with some wine and drink like this

⭐️ Food part
Sands sweet potato fried chicken
This fried chicken heard that it is also a signature dish in the store
There are many golden sand melon powder on it
With the fried fried chicken in it, it looks like
I think this dish is still ok

The golden sweet potato powder outside is pretty good
The fried chicken covered inside
Overall, it is quite extra points!

I personally think the rest of the food is also quite recommended
Especially the well -known ones here include stewed rice or noodles
I personally recommend that I can click on

Because his previous dishes are also very much
It depends on what friends want to choose that day and try it!

The main part of the meal
I think most of them are above the level
And I think it ’s pretty good -looking with his panels and food performance ~

So overall taking pictures will be taken well well
It is very suitable for friends to take pictures together!

⭐️ ⭐ 饮 part
Because I didn't have to plan to drink that day
So there was no drink that day
So there is no way to evaluate this part

⭐️ The atmosphere part
The space in the store is actually not very large
So the distance between the tables and chairs is also quite close
So if there are guests at other tables that day, it is more noisy
It may affect the feeling of our meals

The chair and table in the shop
I think if you are sitting outside the table area
The comfort of the chair and table may be different

After all, my friend and I sat in the sofa area that day
I feel pretty good in the sofa area
The space is also quite comfortable
But the chair in the seat area may not look so comfortable.

The atmosphere in the store is actually quite suitable for dating
And take a elegant and relaxed feeling
But the premise is that the guests at other tables will not be too noisy

⭐️ Service part
There is no special service that day in the impression
It's very basic to order meals and meals, etc.
Of course the waiter was delivering the food
I still introduce the characteristics of each dish a little
This part is basic ~

⭐️ The price part
For this shop
Each of his dishes is actually not low in unit price
In the past
Some unit prices are already close to other general staple food prices outside

And because the portion of this store is not too much
It is mainly to take a exquisite and viewing route
Food, of course, the body is still delicious

But with this price, it is a bit slightly higher

⭐️ location part
Then this restaurant is located in the alley in the East District
It is also very suitable for visiting the nearby East District shop in the afternoon
Come to transfer to date here
Because there are also many shops or restaurants nearby
So I think the position part is quite good

After all, the Eastern District is very convenient whether it is a bus or a MRT mass transportation!

言️ In general
I think this European continental restaurant
Many of his foods are pretty delicious and highly visible
The atmosphere in that shop is also pretty good
Very suitable for dating
But the premise is that I think it will be more suitable

If you are interested in all kinds of small restaurants or tavern foods
This shop is also very suitable for coming
Overall, it will not be very high
But I think it is a high -priced restaurant!

But in terms of the CP value of dating
You can order two main meals and two appetizers
Let's see if you need to drink a little wine that day

This should be solved within $ 2000
If you are interested, you can still come here to try it!",False
"這家餐廳的整體表現屬於中規中矩，無論是服務還是餐點，都沒有特別令人驚喜的地方。當天我們點了三道菜：

1. 口水雞沙拉：雞肉幾乎沒有任何味道，沙拉的醬料偏甜，帶有一點微麻的感覺，但完全不辣。雞肉的處理不夠精細，有一些難以下咽的部位，例如大塊的雞皮，影響了整體口感。
2. 干貝海膽燉飯：選擇加價200元升級海膽，結果海膽少得幾乎看不見。干貝的品質不錯，味道鮮美，但燉飯的番茄底味與干貝的搭配並不理想。如果燉飯是用海鮮湯底熬製，風味可能會更為出色。
3. 軟殼蟹扁麵：軟殼蟹炸得恰到好處，酥脆可口，但麵條過辣且過鹹，兩者的味道搭配並不協調，整道菜讓人感覺不夠和諧。

餐廳在生日月贈送了一個可麗露，味道和口感還算不錯。至於用餐環境，屬於餐酒吧風格，中午時段也有調酒師忙碌的聲音和較大聲的音樂，因此不太適合進行輕鬆的聊天或悠閒地享用午餐。不過，餐廳的廁所環境乾淨，提供了漱口水等比較貼心。

總的來說，這次用餐沒有留下特別深刻的印象，各方面都表現平平。","The overall performance of this restaurant is quite satisfactory, no matter whether it is service or meals, there are no particularly surprising places.We ordered three dishes that day:

1. Swing chicken salad: The chicken has almost no taste. The salad's sauce is sweet, with a little numbness, but it is not spicy.The treatment of chicken is not fine enough, and there are some parts that are difficult to swallow, such as large chicken skin, which affects the overall taste.
2. Dry scallop sea urchin stewing rice: choose to increase the price of 200 yuan to upgrade the sea urchin.The quality of the scallops is good and the taste is delicious, but the taste of the tomato of the stewed rice is not ideal.If the stewed rice is made with seafood soup base, the flavor may be better.
3. Soft -shell crab flat noodles: The soft shell crab is fried just right, crispy and delicious, but the noodles are too spicy and salty. The taste of the two is not coordinated.

The restaurant gave a cocoa on the birthday month, and the taste and taste were pretty good.As for the dining environment, it belongs to the style of the meal bar. There are also busy voices and loud music of the bartender at noon, so it is not suitable for easy chat or leisurely enjoy lunch.However, the toilet environment of the restaurant is clean, providing mouthwash, etc. It is more intimate.

In general, there was no particular impression on dining this time, and all aspects performed mediocre.",False
"每人低消1000，價位偏高，但很好吃所以值得🤣
口水雞沙拉第一次吃到這種調味，完全不違和很好吃！
另外也很推薦金沙炸雞、軟殼蟹義大利麵和干貝燉飯，醬汁濃郁又不會膩。
甜點也很不錯！很精緻、不會太甜膩～
當月壽星還有送甜點（還有蠟燭），很貼心！","Each person eliminates 1,000 lows, the price is high, but it is delicious so it is worthy of 🤣
For the first time, the saliva chicken salad eats this seasoning, it is completely not violated and delicious!
In addition, it is also recommended that golden sand fried chicken, soft shell crab noodles and scallops stew rice. The sauce is rich and not greasy.
The dessert is also very good!Very delicate, not too sweet ~
In the month, Shouxing also had desserts (and candles), which was very intimate!",False
"6/6中午女友幫我過生日選在瑪黑餐酒，之前就去過不少次瑪黑中山體驗都蠻好的，這次換個風格，平日中午，台北陰雨綿綿的天氣，餐廳竟然滿座，果然厲害。

瑪黑很大方，加line會員有50元優會券，我們兩個人可以疊加使用，雖然100塊不多，但我覺得老闆很懂得做生意，難怪高朋滿座，壽星有送兩球冰淇淋，意外好吃，後面詳述。

餐廳的氛圍不錯，放的歌不算新，但剛好是我的年代吧，午餐時段燈光算明亮，環境很整潔，中間換了一次餐盤餐具，這樣很貼心。面對吧台坐位挺不錯的，可惜怕酒駕不能點酒，我看它酒單感覺蠻有趣的。當天喝氣泡水，水資兩人140，以餐廳來說，價格很合理。

當天主要服務我們這桌，是一位瘦瘦的時尚女生，很利落熟練，點餐時也都會提醒這菜有香菜、有蔥之類的，我們都不排斥這些辛香料，但這樣提醒我覺得很好，然後我們的問題都很親切的回答，雖然忙進忙出的，還麻煩她幫忙拍合照，非常感謝。

再來談食物，當天點了六個菜

1.金沙地瓜炸雞：我吃過算非常好的炸雞，油瀝得很乾淨，吃起來不會有油膩感，炸油應該很常換，沒有奇怪的油耗味，當然火候控制的很好，肉嫩但不軟爛，配上一些蔥花跟東泉辣椒醬，增添風味（不辣），應該很適合配酒。

2.布拉塔起司無花果沙拉：我基本上是討厭生菜沙拉的人，但這盤我ok，用油醋醬但不會酸，然後生菜不會像在吃草，嚼到下巴都痠了，也不會放一些帶苦味的菜葉，個人蠻喜歡吃無花果，有評論說無花果放很少，我覺得量很適中。它們入選500盤的是口水雞沙拉，女友細心為了菜色多元化沒重覆點雞，有回訪再試囉。

3.碳烤小卷：我很喜歡，小卷雖然是碳烤的，但肉質還是挺柔軟的，大多數店家的碳烤小卷都會過硬，我自己猜想，或許瑪黑是水煮過再稍微碳烤讓它有香氣的做法吧，附帶一提，下面烤煎過的節瓜蠻好吃的。

前三道菜配速有點快，女友有請服務生上慢一點，後面的上菜的速度很正常。

4.海膽干貝燉飯：網文好像是招牌菜，干貝挺大顆的，新鮮度跟熟度都掌握的很好，燉飯米心我覺得可以再硬一點，但當天的海膽不ok挺腥的，我很喜歡吃現敲海膽的人，但這道招牌菜當天應該出問題，海膽真的很腥，到沒有不新鮮拉肚子之類的，但女友本身對海鮮接受度比較低（她不吃生魚片、淡菜之類帶腥的海鮮），她只吃了一點海膽就要我自己加油，這是餐點扣分的原因 。

5.伊比利豬：吃起來很像牛的豬肉，顏色也挺像牛肉，我們還特別問了服務生，小姐親切仔細回答，因為是用上蓋肉，我只知道教父牛排的牛老饕肉，想不到吃到豬老饕，不過近期剛吃過很厲害的豬肉料理，這盤我覺得不錯，但沒有驚艷，然後有配青椒，不過沒切開，不喜歡青椒味的人放邊邊就可。

6.麻辣牛舌割包：我們自己忘記點，服務生說菜上完囉，我們才發現自己忘了點，服務生的回應也很親切，總之她很棒。牛舌很厚很軟，雖然菜名是麻辣但辣度只有微微的，但這道菜調味挺淡的，加上牛舌很厚，牛味有點重，不見得每個人都能接受，然後女友討厭孜然，她對孜然味很敏感，他覺有加，我不確定，總之她個人不太能接受，兩個都我處理的。

兩個人吃完六個菜，以我們來說挺飽的，份量很夠。

壽星甜點是兩球冰淇淋，餐盤用巧克力醬寫了Happy birthday，還附了跟細長的銀色蠟燭，算有儀式感。我們吃到的冰淇淋口味是草莓跟紅心芭樂，草莓不會有超香的人工草莓香精味，也不是整球粉紅色那種，草莓帶酸但不過酸，算是表現的不錯；紅心芭樂超好吃，芭樂味很足我很喜歡，杯底放了些餅乾屑很香。原本覺得餐酒館的冰淇淋應該不怎麼樣，結果算意外的驚喜。

結論：這次用餐體驗很不錯，開心的生日餐。","6/6 noon girlfriend helped me choose my birthday in Ma Black Food Wine. I have visited many times before the Malaysian Zhongshan experience. Sure enough.

Ma Hei is very generous. Plus LINE members have 50 yuan coupons. The two of us can be used for use. Although there are not many more than 100 yuan, I think the boss knows how to do business. , Detail later.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is good. The songs are not new, but it is just my age. The lights during lunch are bright and the environment is very clean. I changed the dinner tableware in the middle. This is very intimate.Facing the bar seat is pretty good, but unfortunately I ca n’t order drinking. I think it feels very interesting.Drinking water and soaking water on the day, 140 water assets. For restaurants, the price is reasonable.

On the day, the main service of our table was a thin fashion girl. It was very proficient and proficient. When ordering, we reminded this dish with coriander and shallots. We did not exclude these spices. Very good, then our question was very kindly answered. Although she was busy, she also troubled her to take a photo. Thank you very much.

Let's talk about food again, or order six dishes that day

1. Sands sweet potato fried chicken: I have eaten a very good fried chicken, the oil is very clean, and it will not feel greasy. Fried oil should be changed very often. There is no strange fuel consumption. Of course , The meat is tender but not soft. With some green onions and Dongquan chili sauce, it adds flavor (not spicy), which should be very suitable for wine.

2. Blata cheese -free fruit salad: I basically hate lettuce salad, but I am ok, but oily vinegar sauce but not sour, and then lettuce will not be sour when you chew the chin and chew to the chin. , I wo n’t put some bitter leaves. I personally like to eat figs. Some comments say that there are very few figs. I think the amount is very moderate.They were selected for 500 sets of saliva chicken salads. Girlfriend carefully did not repeat the chicken for the diversification of the dishes.

3. Small carbon roasting: I like it very much. Although the small roll is grilled, the meat is still very soft. Carbon roasting it has a aroma method, with a mention of mentioning, the fried frying melon below is pretty delicious.

The first three dishes are a bit fast, and the girlfriend has to ask the waiter to slow down, and the speed of serving in the back is normal.

4. Hypenolin scallop stew: The web text seems to be a signature dish. The scallops are quite large. The freshness and maturity are well mastered. I think it can be harder, but the sea urchin that day is not OK. Well, I like to eat people who are now knocking on the sea urchin, but this signature dish should have a problem that day. The sea urchin is really very fishy. She had fishy seafood and other fishy seafood). She only ate a little sea urchin and asked me to cheer. This is why the meal is deducted.

5. Ibilia: It tastes like beef pork, and the color is quite like beef. We also asked the waiter. The lady answered carefully, because it was covered with meat. , I ca n’t think of eating old pigs, but I have just eaten very powerful pork dishes recently. I feel good in this plate, but there is no amazing, and then there are green peppers, but people who do n’t cut them. Essence

6. Spicy beef tongue cutting bags: We forgot to point out. The waiter said that the dishes were finished, and we found that we had forgotten something, and the waiter's response was very kind. In short, she was great.The beef tongue is very thick and soft. Although the dish name is spicy but only slightly spicy, the dish is very light, and the beef tongue is very thick and the beef taste is a bit heavy. Hate cumin, she is very sensitive to cumin taste. He feels that there is an addition. I am not sure. In short, she is not very acceptable. Both of them do.

Two people have eaten six dishes, so we are full, and the portion is enough.

The Shouxing dessert is two -ball ice cream. The plate is written with chocolate sauce. HAPPY BIRTHDAY is also attached to the slender silver candle, which is considered a sense of ritual.The taste of ice cream we eat is strawberry and red heart guava. Strawberries will not have super fragrant artificial strawberry flavor, nor is the whole ball pink. Strawberry belt is sour but sour, which can be regarded as good. It ’s delicious, and Belle is very good. I like it very much. Some biscuits are very fragrant on the bottom of the cup.I originally felt that the ice cream of the restaurant should not be very good, and the result was a surprise surprise.

Conclusion: This dining experience is very good, happy birthday meal.",False
點了海膽干貝燉飯、金沙地瓜炸雞、伊比利豬等共4道，都蠻好吃的，干貝很新鮮，炸雞口感很嫩，麵的軟硬度適中有嚼勁，調味也好吃，環境也蠻安靜的，沙發區舒適，是請客約會好地點，雖然有點貴但還是推薦喔🤩,"I ordered four sections of sea urchin stewed rice, golden sand sweet potato fried chicken, Ibilia pigs, etc., all of which are delicious. The scallops are very fresh, the fried chicken tastes very tender, the softness of the noodles is moderate and chewy, the seasoning is delicious and delicious , The environment is also quite quiet. The sofa area is comfortable. It is a good place to date. Although it is a bit expensive, it is still recommended.",False
"瑪黑的服務很好。
與先生是來慶祝週年和生日的，
店家招待了週年冰淇淋，因為本身對芋頭過敏，服務人員還幫我確認冰淇淋口味裡面有無芋頭，並且又再次跟廚房確認，冰淇淋裡的某個口味有跟堅果類是同一個生產線，所以又多幫我準備了一球仙草冰淇淋以防我過敏。
服務上來說，我真的覺得很窩心，謝謝服務人員。

餐點的部分：
🍠🐔金沙地瓜炸雞（這道我看網路上很多人推薦）
使用的部位是雞腿肉，雞腿肉本身有個雞騷味
吃第一塊時以為我吃錯，再吃第二塊時確定有個我不太喜歡的雞騷味。吃不下去就想說外帶回家給老公吃，結果回到家老公打開來吃時，咬到雞骨頭，就是照片中最後一張，有兩根刺骨，雞腿肉通常蠻難會吃到骨頭的，所以讓我蠻困惑的，會建議店家在菜單中標明要注意骨頭。

🥗無花果沙拉
這道真的很爽口，布拉塔起士沒有濃厚的起士味，搭配巴沙米可醋+橄欖油，堅果的部分也很香甜，真的很好吃。

🦪生蠔：一開始只點兩顆想說試味道和新鮮度，吃完之後直接再加點四顆，很鮮甜的生蠔味，本身對不新鮮的海鮮會全身起尋麻疹過敏，但是瑪黑的生蠔吃完是沒有過敏的狀態。是很新鮮的，我很喜歡。

🐮👅麻辣牛舌刈包：
牛舌是厚切牛舌，喜歡厚切牛舌的人是會喜歡的，但是我個人不喜歡厚切牛舌的口感，以及害怕厚切牛舌本身的那個味道，牛舌刈包服務員很貼心標註可以幫我們切為四等份。

🐷伊比利老饕：七分熟，給的醬汁偏少之外，這道整體來說這道是好吃的。

🐮澳洲和牛：五分熟，牛肉上面鋪上蔥，吃起來像是高規版蔥爆牛肉，個人覺得是很好吃的。
兩份主餐都很不錯，蠻推薦的。

雖然吃完後大概三個小時，肚子有點不太舒服，跟先生都拉了肚子，不知道是不是食材處理上沒有很衛生，可能拿切過生肉的刀子切生菜？

停車：市民大道上正好停停車塲（星期五晚上會大排長龍）

補6/17有接到瑪黑領班的慰問電話，很真心的關切我們拉肚子的狀況，備感欣慰，也回覆身體狀況截至目前為止都良好，也一直道歉地瓜炸雞裡面有骨頭，服務是真的很好，也期許食物會更服務一樣好👍","Ma Hei's service is very good.
He is here to celebrate the anniversary and birthday,
The store entertained the anniversary ice cream. Because it was allergic to taro, the service staff also helped me to confirm that there was taro in the taste of ice cream, and confirmed to the kitchen again. Help me prepare a ball of fairy grass ice cream to prevent me from allergies.
In terms of service, I really feel very worried, thank you for the service staff.

Meal part:
鸡 Jinsha sweet potato fried chicken (I recommend many people on the Internet here)
The part used is chicken leg meat, chicken legs have a chicken flavor
I thought I was wrong when I ate the first piece. When I ate the second piece, I was sure that there was a chicken flavor that I didn't like.If you ca n’t eat it, you want to take home to eat it for your husband. As a result, when your husband goes home to open it, he bites the chicken bone, which is the last one in the photo. There are two pierced skeletons. So what makes me quite confused, I will recommend that the store indicates that the bones should be paid to the bones in the menu.

🥗 🥗 🥗 🥗 🥗 🥗 🥗
This is really refreshing. The Bulata cheese has no strong cheese flavor. With Bashami vinegar+olive oil, the nuts of the nuts are also very sweet and really delicious.

只 Oyster: At the beginning, I only ordered two one to talk about the taste and freshness. After eating it, add four more. The delicious oyster flavor will be allergic to measles all over the body. Oysters are not allergic to eating.It's very fresh, I like it very much.

刈 Spicy beef tongue 牛 bag:
Beef tongue is thick -cut beef tongue. People who like thick cut beef tongue will like it, but I personally don't like the taste of thick cut beef tongue, and the taste of fear of thick cut beef tongue. The marking can help us cut into four -class portion.

： 🐷 🐷 🐷: Seven points are cooked, and the sauce given is less. In this whole, this is delicious.

五 Australia and beef: Five cooked, laid onion on the beef, it tastes like a high -quality version of the beef, personally I think it is delicious.
Both of the main meals are very good, and it is quite recommended.

Although it was about three hours after eating, the stomach was a bit uncomfortable. I pulled my belly with my husband. I do n’t know if I did n’t have a hygiene in the treatment of ingredients. Maybe I took the knife that cut raw meat and cut the lettuce?

Parking: Parking on the citizen's avenue (there will be a long queue on Friday night)

Make up 6/17 to receive a condolences from the Ma Hei collaring class. I sincerely care about the condition of our diarrhea, I feel relieved, and I have responded to the physical condition so far. It's very good, I hope that the food will be more service -oriented.",False

"今天兩人吃$2728，中高價位，餐點精緻有巧思，調酒中規中矩，可客製，可請服務人員介紹～菜單好像每季都會更換，環境舒適，氣氛美燈光佳，今天坐在類似半包廂的沙發位，點幾道菜跟姐妹喝一杯很chill。

炭烤海鮮酪梨沙拉$460
清爽的日式鰹魚口味，搭配炭烤小卷、鮮蝦，很開胃。

番茄梅香布拉塔起司$520
這道很好吃，熬煮的番茄醬、小番茄搭配一整顆布拉塔起司，酸香口味的醬汁配上濃醇起司，爽口美味。

炙烤芥末小卷$380
整尾炭烤小卷塞入毛豆泥、芥末，擺上山蘇，微辣，口味滿特殊的，不過朋友覺得還好，毛豆味道太搶眼，芥末味不夠突出，但我自己覺得很有趣，算是世面上少見的味道。

調酒師特調$400
茶酒基底，加上茉莉花茶跟葡萄。請服務人員介紹的特調，當天要求是水果、偏酸及茶酒基底，喝起來有點秋雅（一種梅酒）的氣息，不會太甜也不會太酸。

芭樂琴桃$400
芭樂、蒔蘿、琴酒基底，酒精濃度兩顆星，芭樂跟梅粉的味道會越來越濃，也是好喝的。

香蕉咖啡馬斯卡邦$320
今天最驚豔的一道，吃起來是提拉米蘇，馬斯卡邦入口即化，包覆香草冰淇淋、焦糖核桃及香蕉，最底部是巧克力蛋糕，上方灑些許海鹽，口味多層次，每口會吃到不同內餡，大推薦。","Today, the two ate $ 2728. The mid -to -high price is exquisite and ingenious.

"四人用餐，低消$1000+10%服務費/1人。開罐水、氣泡水都有開瓶費。餐點選擇不多，我們是直接選套餐再單點。

當天有一位壽星，加入會員有折價券，但僅能各家店規定可以用的優惠券。當天的優惠是贈送壽星冰淇淋。（牛奶巧克力口味各一球）

整體來說料理都還算是不錯，酒水比較偏清爽的茶調酒，整體都比較清淡適合小酌。

◉餐點

我們點了一份3980套餐搭配單點：

布拉塔起司無花果沙拉
一球起司味道不會太重很搭，也不錯吃。但無花果很少，比之後甜點上的還要少。蠻微妙的。

金沙地瓜炸雞
搭配東泉辣椒醬微甜辣的炸雞，肉質軟嫩，口味很不錯。美中不足是麵衣比較鬆散，個人比較不愛。

烤茄子
搭配羅勒油和蔥絲的烤蛋型茄子，好吃是好吃但沒有很特別，比較中規中矩。

炭烤魷魚
魷魚烤得軟嫩多汁，搭配沙拉的點綴，也是偏中規中矩好吃。

伊比利豬
這道算是很驚艷。煎烤伊比利豬做的很像牛肉厚度，搭配青辣椒、蘿蔔，味道很好👍🏻蘿蔔泥調味帶有鹹香非常好！

嫩煎干貝海膽燉飯
奶醬濃厚，煮得有米心算是很標準好吃的燉飯。內有三份的鱒魚卵、魚子醬、干貝、海膽，整體cp算是蠻不錯！也很好吃。

酥炸軟殼蟹細扁麵
也是偏微辣的料理，麵的料理口味有讓我們驚艷。個人對軟殼蟹還好，但會想單點這款微辣的麵！

甜點：焦糖布里歐
甜度燒微高的焦糖吐司，有脆口的焦糖和上色的吐司，口感層次豐富，個人覺得很不錯。帶有苦味、酒香濃郁的威士忌冰淇淋和鮮奶油畫龍點睛，整個愛上！個人很愛❤️

|酒水推薦｜

有酒精：沙漠之花 / 今日特調（有咖啡和莓果琴酒調和的酒很特別！喜歡）

無酒精：春

◉服務
比較可惜，在介紹、點餐等的服務生不是很專業，以這樣的價位會覺得服務好像可以更好。
（而且有服務費，氣泡水要$140個的狀況下）

◉氣氛
走暗色系是最安全的，但整個空間配置更像是燒烤店，有點擁擠，同服務會覺得和價位對不太起來。","Four people eat at a low -time $ 1000+10%service fee/1 person.There are bottle -opening fees for boiling water and bubble water.There are not many meals. We choose the package directly and then order.

On the day, there was a Shouxing that joined the membership of the membership, but only the coupons that could be used by each store could only be used.The discount on the day was to give birthday ice cream.(Milk chocolate flavor one goal)

On the whole, the cooking is pretty good. The wine with a relatively refreshing wine is lighter and suitable for drinking.

Meal

We ordered a 3980 package with a single point:

Blata cheeseless flower fruity salad
One -ball cheese taste is not too heavy, and it is good to eat.But there are few figs, less than later desserts.Pretty subtle.

Sands sweet potato fried chicken
With the slightly sweet fried chicken with Dongquan chili sauce, the meat is soft and tender, and the taste is very good.The disadvantage is that the noodles are relatively loose, and individuals don't love it.

Grilled eggplant
With the grilled eggplant eggplant with Laler oil and green onion, it is delicious but not very special. It is quite satisfactory.

Charcoal grilled squid
The squid is grilled soft and juicy, and the embellishment of the salad is also delicious and delicious.

Ibilia pig
This is amazing.The fried Ibish pig is made of beef thickness. With green peppers and radish, the taste is very good 👍🏻 radish mud seasoning with salty aroma is very good!

Tender dried dried scallion sea urchin stewed rice
The milk sauce is thick, and the cooked rice heart is a very standard and delicious stew.There are three copies of catfish eggs, caviar, scallops, and sea urchins. The overall CP is pretty good!It's also delicious.

Crispy soft shell crab fine flat surface
It is also a slightly spicy dish, and the taste of noodles is amazing.Personal is okay to soft shell crabs, but I want to order this slightly spicy noodles!

Dessert: caramel Borio
Sweet -burning a slightly high caramel toast, with crispy caramel and colorful toast. The taste is rich and personally feels very good.With bitterness and strong wine, the whiskey ice cream and fresh cream are finishing touch, and the whole fell in love!Personally love ❤️

There is alcohol: Flowers of the Desert / Special Turning (Coffee and Berrying Brewery Wine is very special! Like)

No Alcohol: Spring

"嫩煎干貝燉飯

酥炸軟殼蟹辣椒細扁麵🦀

整隻的軟殼蟹搭配是拉差辣椒醬跟炸過的羽衣甘藍一起下去製作而成在擠上麵裡附的檸檬吃起來微酸又有點小辣好吃又特別,羽衣甘藍則可以解膩

餐酒館低消$1000是沒必要大驚小怪沒錯，但總共花了5千多完全沒吃飽，是我們太不會選餐點還是選擇太少東西也太少呢？
一到餐廳就被知會今天已經有些餐點賣完了不能點，飯或麵類的主食也只有兩樣可以選擇，後來點餐我們本來想選擇每個人都點一份燉飯或是義大利麵，但店員也很好心的提醒我們，燉飯點一個一起吃就夠了，不然會太膩。
非常謝謝店員貼心的建議，吃完過後還真的很膩，如果就知道很膩，那餐點部分能否讓顧客有更多選擇呢？重點是吃到很膩還沒有提供水可以喝 ，份量也是少得可憐🚬
看網路評論麻辣牛舌是很值得嘗試的，吃完就只能說 完全吃不懂，叫麻辣牛舌最基本也是要辣吧⋯牛舌部分就不多做評論了，好不好吃真的見仁見智

There is no need to be a fuss for a dinner tavern low to consume $ 1000, but it costs more than 5,000 to eat it at all. Do we not choose meals or choose too little or too little?
As soon as I arrived at the restaurant, I was known that there were some meals today and I couldn't order it. There were only two staple foods for meals or noodles to choose from. Later, we originally wanted to choose everyone to order a stew or pasta. But the clerk also reminded us very well that it would be enough to eat a stew to eat together, otherwise it would be too greasy.
Thank you very much for your thoughtful suggestions. After eating it, you are really tired. If you know it is greasy, can the meal part give customers more choices?The point is that it is very greasy to drink, and the portion is too poor.
Watching the Internet comment is worth trying. After eating, you can only say that you do n’t understand it completely. It ’s the most basically spicy for spicy beef tongue. See the wisdom
The most unhappy thing is that because the menu has too few choices, the low -consumption in the store is high. After turning to the back, we have coded the high -priced Hetao New Yorker $ 1880
I really think we are a large plate as soon as I serve :) Six pieces of meat nearly 2,000 pieces, okay, I will come this time anyway

How did the sauce be cooked?
The taste of the tomato cream that can be used to be able to mix such a unpalatable thing
There is no taste of sea urchin at all

PASTA & RISOTTO
▪️海膽燉飯 $680
干貝/番茄海膽醬/柚子/白酒魚軟醬汁
米是有米心ㄉ！有米心我直接先雷文克勞加十分，干貝比想像中大，海膽也滿新鮮ㄉ真的會像奶油一樣化開～～感覺每一桌都有點是非常招牌的一道主食（小聲說我覺得這道很好吃但加了柚子有點怪怪的如果沒有柚子我會超級愛）

雖然是以餐酒館的形式經營，
但菜色並不會因為這樣而口味偏重，
採用單點的模式，吃多少點多少，
比起套餐對我們來說剛剛好，真的太棒了！
今天點了
布拉塔起司新鮮無花果沙拉
鮑魚仙草鷄白湯
炭烤伊比利豬 味噌奶油拌麵
和歌山鰆魚
甜點是＂紅心芭樂＂

整體環境舒適，

在拍照上的光線略顯不足；
服務人員訓練有素，
可以很快理解客戶需求，
服務上也非常積極。

菜色非常有特色，
口味還不錯，

我們兩人點上面的菜色是剛剛好的八分飽，

"前菜更優秀的餐酒館！

每一道的餐點的presentation都很棒，考慮價格還有味道的層次感，個人覺得前菜更加優秀！

香辣的仁當牛、氮氣馬鈴薯泥和烤香的歐式麵包搭在一起，口感濃郁又飽滿很好吃！

至於這次點的主餐干貝海膽燉飯還有炭烤伊比利豬味噌奶油拌面（雞蛋麵）口味的濃淡與層次比較單調，容易膩，希望下次有機會再嚐嚐其他餐點。

（每人低消800元）","The better dining tavern for the former dish!

The presentation of each meal is great. Considering the price of the price and the taste, I personally think that the previous dish is better!

The spicy Ren Dangzheng beef, nitrogen potato puree and grilled European bread are put together. The taste is strong and full of delicious!

As for the main meals of this main meal, the sea urchin stewed rice, and the charcoal grilled Ibilia pig miso cream noodles (egg noodles) flavors are relatively monotonous and easy to get tired. I hope that the next time I have the opportunity to taste other meals.

"沉穩的墨綠色裝潢，桌上燈光充足，不過桌邊以外的部分感覺有些太暗了；出餐速度蠻快，以價格來說餐點品質有些差強人意，調飲亦平淡了些

茉莉伯爵mocktail
西洋梨、茉莉花、伯爵茶，茉莉花搭上西洋梨的味道有種清潔劑似，不大討喜的香氣

燻香無花果mocktail
無花果、蜜李、燻香紅茶，紅茶以外是直白的李子和煙燻烏梅汁風味

布拉塔起司無花果沙拉
布拉塔起司和平常吃到的慢慢弄相比更紮實些，奶味鮮明，上桌酒醋香氣明顯，但嚐起來倒是不大酸，白葡萄和蜂蜜提供充足的甜味，算是不錯的沙拉

酥炸發酵芋頭
當晚最喜歡的菜（結果我沒拍到這個😅），上桌就充滿炸物的溫暖氣息，發酵芋頭做的芋泥球口感鬆軟，除了芋頭香氣外，咀嚼中透出發酵酸味讓風味頗有層次感。
白酒起司醬有蘑菇濃湯般的鮮鹹味，配菜的菊芋也是鬆軟的馬鈴薯口感，和醬汁蠻搭；不過孢子甘藍有些苦

伊比利豬味噌奶油拌麵
豬肉有筋，且口感有點韌，沒什麼伊比利豬的果實香甜；麵條雖細但口感蠻好，溫泉蛋和味噌奶油醬讓整體濃郁滑順，剝皮辣椒微微的酸辣是點睛之筆

薩索雞腿
雞腿肉質不錯，但外皮沒有烤脆或焦香，欠缺點口感變化；搭配的奶油烤飯即使拌入油封蛋黃仍顯無味，其中的竹筍丁倒是蠻甜
整體來說是有點不理解想表達什麼的一道菜，配菜還有醃蘿蔔，猜想可能是雞腿便當的概念？

金沙地瓜炸雞
雞肉口感嫩，麵衣口感鬆厚。金沙地瓜醬沒有鹹蛋黃的味道，似全被地瓜蓋過，東泉辣椒醬有點梅子的甜感，吞下後喉頭會殘留一股喝了中藥似苦味，感覺醬汁間的搭配不是很契合

紅心芭樂
白色的是檸檬棉花糖，包裹著烏龍茶馬斯卡彭奶凍和紅心芭樂凍，雪酪也是紅心芭樂，風味算是蠻直接的芭樂香甜，檸檬棉花糖帶點口感變化，也喜歡烏龍茶帶出的一絲茶香，雖然呈外觀呈現上可更細緻，但個人算蠻喜歡","The calm dark green decoration, the lights on the table are sufficient, but the part of the side of the table feels a bit too dark; the meal is quite fast, the quality of the meal is a bit unsatisfactory, and the tuning is a bit more dull.

Earl Mocktail
West pear, jasmine, Earl tea, jasmine's taste of western pears has a detergent, which is not very pleasing.

Flowing fig Mocktail
Figs, honey Li, smoked fragrant black tea, black tea outside is straightforward plums and smoky Wumei juice flavor

Blata cheeseless flower fruity salad
Blata cheese is more solidly more solid compared to the commonly eaten. The milk flavor is clear, the aroma of wine and vinegar on the table is not sour. White grapes and honey provide sufficient sweetness. Salad

Crispy fermentation taro
That night's favorite dish (as a result, I did not take this cricket), the table was filled with the warmth of the fried objects, and the taro balls made of fermented taro were soft. In addition to the aroma of taro, the fermented sour flavor made the flavor. Layering.
Baijiu cheese sauce has a fresh and salty flavor of mushroom soup. The chrysanthemum of the side dishes is also soft potato taste, and the sauce is quite bitter; however

Ibilia pig miso cream noodles
The pork is gluten and the taste is a bit tough. There is no sweet fruit of Ibilia. Although the noodles are thin but the taste is pretty good, the hot spring eggs and miso cream sauce make the overall rich and smooth.

Sasau chicken leg
The chicken legs are good, but the outer skin is not crispy or scorched, and the shortcomings of the shortcomings change; even if the cream rice grilled rice is mixed with the oily egg yolk, it is still tasteless.
Overall, it is a dish that I want to express, and the side dishes and pickled radish. I guess might be the concept of chicken leg bento?

Sands sweet potato fried chicken
The chicken feels tender and the noodle mouth feels loose.Jinsha sweet potato sauce does not have the taste of salted egg yolk, it seems to be covered by sweet potatoes. Dongquan chili sauce has a bit of sweetness. After swallowing the throat, a Chinese medicine will remain bitter.

Red -hearted guava
The white ones are lemon marshmallow, wrapped in oolong tea Masca Peng milk frozen and red -hearted guava frozen. Snow cheese is also red -hearted guava. The flavor is quite direct beamonal sweet, lemon marshmallow belt has a little bit of mouth change, and oolong tea belt also likes A trace of tea in the tea can be more detailed although it appears in appearance, but personally likes it.",False

"💬台北中高價位餐酒館，服務好氣氛佳，看似法式料理，卻融入台灣在地食材製作出一道道精美的創意餐食，非常適合朋友聚會、約會或慶生，讓人會想二訪

📍炙燒干貝軟絲沙拉 $460
一上桌就令人「哇～」擺盤也太美了！份量充足，除了有許多不常見的生菜外，中間擺上柿子切片，淋上檸檬胡蘿蔔油醋，醬料使得沙拉整體吃起來清爽，干貝和軟絲吃起來也很鮮甜。

📍麻辣牛舌 $360
使用台式掛包配上厚切牛舌，牛舌很Q彈不會難咀嚼，醬料只有些許的辣但非常麻！內餡還有焦糖榛果脆片和香菜，整體吃起來味道很複雜，我比較沒有那麼喜歡。

📍金沙地瓜炸雞 $380
炸雞使用雞腿肉，雖然外皮不是走酥脆路線，但雞肉吃起來超～嫩～金沙醬也鹹甜適中，配上超local的東泉辣椒醬，意外蹦出新滋味！（但找不太到地瓜在哪裡）

📍炭烤伊比利豬味噌奶油拌麵 $450
這道拌麵使用的麵體比較像日式拉麵，店員建議我們將溫泉蛋和麵拌在一起，吃起來非常濃郁，味噌的味道不會過於搶戲，讓人忍不住一口接一口。伊比利豬的部分十分軟嫩，但咀嚼到後面會有點豬的味道。

📍酥炸軟殼蟹辣椒細扁麵 $460
軟殼蟹炸得非常酥脆，使用細扁麵配上微辣的醬汁，那這種辣是很台式的辣醬，有台式義大利麵的感覺。

📍海膽燉飯 $620
超人氣必點就是這道！上桌時服務生會淋上白酒魚卵醬汁，外觀就美到不行，吃下口更是驚艷！每一口奶味充足，米心偏硬但我很喜歡這種粒粒分明又有嚼勁的口感，生食級干貝和海膽更不用說，吃起來很鮮甜，這是我最喜歡的一道。

📍紅心芭樂 $320
意外喜歡的甜點！原本以為那球白色的東西是軟軟的奶油，外層其實是很像棉花糖的口感，切開後是紅心芭樂雪酪、紅心芭樂凍、烏龍茶馬斯卡邦奶凍，口感綿密卻一點都不膩口，反而以紅心芭樂為主軸來製作甜點，吃起來非常解膩！這道也是我的必點。

⚠️有收10%服務費
⚠️低消$800/人
⚠️假日海膽燉飯可能會售完，可先打電話預訂
⚠️訂位時可備註慶生或紀念日，會在甜點上獲得精美巧克力手寫英文字","Taipei Middle and High -priced dining tavern, with a good service atmosphere, seemingly French cuisine, but incorporated into Taiwan's local ingredients to make exquisite creative meals, which is very suitable for friends to meet, date or celebrate their birthdays.

Roasted Dry scallop soft silk salad $ 460
It is too beautiful to put on the table as ""wow ~""!In addition, in addition to many uncommon lettuce, persimmons are sliced ​​in the middle, drizzle with lemon and carrot oil vinegar. The sauce makes the salad taste refreshing as a whole, and the scallops and soft silk are also very sweet.

3 Spicy beef tongue $ 360
Use a desktop hanging bag with a thick cut tongue. The beef tongue is very q bombs and will not be difficult to chew. The sauce is only a little spicy but very numb!The filling also has caramel hazelnut crisp and coriander. The overall taste is very complicated. I don't like it so much.

鸡 鸡 📍 📍 📍 📍 📍 $ 380
The fried chicken uses chicken leg meat. Although the skin is not a crispy route, the chicken tastes super ~ tender ~ Sands sauce is also salty and sweet. With the ultra -Local Dongquan chili sauce, it accidentally pops out a new taste!(But I ca n’t find where the sweet potato is)

Carbon roasted Ibish pork pork cream noodles $ 450
The noodle noodles are more like Japanese ramen. The clerk suggested that we mix the hot spring eggs and noodles together. It tastes very strong. The smell of miso will not be too grabbing, making people unable to take a bite.The part of the Iberbille pig is very soft, but it will have a pig taste after chewing.

Crispy soft shell crab pepper fine flat surface $ 460
The soft shell crab is very crispy, and the fine flat surface with slightly spicy sauce is used. This kind of spicy is a very desktop hot sauce, which has a desktop and spasm.

$ $ 📍 📍 📍 📍 $ 620
This is the super popularity!When serving, the waiter will drizzle with white wine and fish egg sauce.Every bite of milk is sufficient, Mi Xin is hard, but I like this kind of grain and chewy taste. It is not necessary to say that raw foods and sea urchin are not needed. It tastes very sweet. This is my favorite one.

3 Red Heart Bava $ 320
Unexpected desserts!I originally thought that the white thing was soft cream. The outer layer was actually like the taste of marshmallow. After cutting, it was red -hearted guava snow cheese, red -hearted guava frozen, oolong tea Mascang milk frozen, dense taste, but the taste was dense but the taste was dense but the taste was dense. Nothing is not greasy at all, but uses red heart guava as the main axis to make desserts, which is very greasy to taste!This is also mine.

麵衣保有薄酥感，經典的台式風味
鹹甜不會辣，吃多有點鹹膩，建議多人分食

當天的鴨胸偏有嚼勁
佐焦糖柚子南瓜泥和雞汁
微酸甜的風味，不是很合我胃口

當天的季節甜點是巧克力伯爵蛋糕
整體是想像中的味道 更喜歡旁邊的伯爵冰淇淋
珍珠是溫的而且偏軟 搭配起來不是很和諧

番茄梅是梅酒/龍舌蘭/番茄🍅
酸甜順口，沒什麼酒感很適合女生

沙漠之花是最熱門的品項🌹
琴酒/玫瑰紅綠茶/玫瑰/蜜桃

2021.03一訪

☁️麻辣牛舌
當時店員送上來其中有一塊牛舌很硬 同行友人的卻非常軟嫩 吃了有點疑惑就跟店家反應 他們馬上表示願意重新製作 本來以為只會補一顆 結果後來送餐時說明可能是使用到舌根的部分 直接重新製作兩顆給我們！感受到對於員工訓練和顧客處理都非常好！
採用刈包的形式個人蠻喜歡的 加入紫高麗更加酸甜清爽 牛舌也很軟嫩💖

☁️椒麻炸雞翅
雞翅比其他餐廳都大一些 肉多也很嫩 麵衣酥脆 椒麻調味非常香 偏台式很合我的胃口 個人覺得不沾辣椒醬就很涮嘴👍🏻

☁️仁當牛
這道最驚豔的是氮氣馬鈴薯！今天吃到最喜歡的菜色🤩非常輕盈 裸麥麵包也是我喜歡的硬脆口給 搭配著吃很不錯💕 牛的部分有些很軟嫩 有些口感較硬 中規中矩👌🏻

☁️伊比利老饕
份量很足 不過個人覺得跟雞汁不是特別搭 算是今天相較普通的菜色 不過豬肉本身蠻軟嫩好吃的🐷

The handling of scallops is also impeccable

Paris noodles attracted by the name
With my beloved nitrogen potato
The entrance is still dense and smooth in memory
But compared to the lack of richness and aroma
The noodle feels like a radish cake, the skin is slightly crispy inside and soft inside

Devising Jinsha sweet potato fried chicken, fleshy tender juice water is sufficient
Drizzle the dense salted egg mud, Dongquan chili sauce
Noodles have thin crispy feelings, classic desktop flavors
Salted sweetness will not be spicy, so much salty to eat, it is recommended to eat more people

The duck breasts of the day are chewy
Caramel, grapefruit pumpkin puree and chicken juice
The slightly sweet and sour flavor is not very good at my stomach

☁️ Spicy beef tongue
At that time, the clerk sent one of the beef tongues with hard colleagues and friends, but very soft and tender. If you are doubtful, he responds to the store and immediately expressed his willingness to re -make it. The part of the part is directly re -made for us!Feel very good for employee training and customer treatment!
The form of a puppet bag personally likes to join Zi Gauli more sweet and sour, and the beef tongue is very soft and tender.

️ Jiao Ma fried chicken wings
Chicken wings are larger than other restaurants and are very tender and crispy crispy pepper numb seasoning, very fragrant, and very good.

☁️ Ren Dang Cattle
The most amazing thing is nitrogen potato!I ate the favorite dish today. The very light bare wheat bread is also my favorite hard and crunchy.

饕️ Old Ibilia
The portion is enough, but personally I feel that it is not particularly compared to ordinary dishes today than chicken juice, but the pork itself is quite soft and delicious.

"只能說這邊餐廳CP值不高，唯一覺得還不錯的是裝潢還不錯~整體來說不推，個人不會推薦朋友來，也不會再回訪～

❌ 缺點：
1. 一進門就有提醒每人低消$1000，但我看訂位網站的菜單上寫$800......
2. 吃飯想聊天或拍照時，會看到店員一直在旁邊持續地注視著我們...雖然可能是想看看是不是需要服務，但已經到有點感到不舒服
3. 水的開瓶費$140，可能價錢稍高的餐廳都會這樣（？）但總覺得要花140拿個水喝，真的挺盤的
4. 我們是情侶去，兩個平常食量不大，一般的池上便當買一人一個，我們是會吃不完的那種！但昨天點了一個干貝海膽燉飯、金沙地瓜炸雞、一份鴨胸及一杯生啤酒，加上服務費是2200左右，但我們兩個都沒吃飽哈哈（最後甚至吃了我們自己帶來的蛋糕，走出餐廳還是沒吃飽）
5. 餐點：後續也沒有問餐點有沒有問題 QQ
✨干貝海膽燉飯$650
恩.......雖然外表看起來好吃，共有三顆干貝，但個人覺得醬汁的搭配有點奇怪，而且干貝裡面還冰冰？？？
✨鴨胸$880
咬不斷！！！真的咬不斷也切不斷...到最後直接吐出來放棄咀嚼==

✔️優點：
1. 裝潢還不錯，室內都是全黑的，蠻好拍照，但不知道是清潔不完全還是怎樣，沒有高級感QQ
2. 可以幫忙冰蛋糕，也不會另外收費
3. 生日來會有多一杯送的生日調酒，但小小杯的~
4. 最好吃的餐點就是：
✨金沙地瓜炸雞 $360
炸得外酥內軟，外層淋上金沙地瓜醬和東泉辣椒醬，但分量也不多~","It can only be said that the CP value of the restaurant here is not high. The only thing that feels good is that the decoration is not bad ~ Overall, I will not recommend friends, and I will not visit again ~

❌ Disadvantages:
1. As soon as you enter the door, you remind you to consume a low of $ 1000 at a low, but I read the menu of the booking website for $ 800 ...
2. When you want to chat or take a picture, you will see that the clerk has been watching us on the side ... Although you may want to see if you need service, but you have a bit uncomfortable
3. The bottle opening fee of the water is $ 140. The restaurant with a slightly higher price will be like this (?) But I always feel that it takes 140 to take a water to drink.
4. We are a couple. The two usual foods are not large, and the general pool is buying one person.But yesterday, I ordered a dried shellfish sea urchin stew, golden sand sweet potato fried chicken, a duck breast and a cup of beer, and the service fee was about 2200, but neither of us was full. The cake, I still don’t have enough to walk out of the restaurant)
5. Meal: There are no questions about meals in the future.
Dry scallop sea urchin stewed rice $ 650
Well ... Although the appearance looks delicious, there are three scallops, but I personally think that the matching of the sauce is a bit strange, and the scallops are still ice inside?IntersectionIntersection
8 duck breasts $ 880
Keep the bite!IntersectionIntersectionReally bite and keep cutting ... I vomit and give up chewing in the end. ==

✔️ Advantages:
1. The decoration is not bad, the room is all black, it is pretty good to take pictures, but I don’t know if it is incomplete or not, there is no sense of high -level qq
2. You can help ice cakes, and you will not charge another charge
3. There will be one more cup of birthday to bartender, but a small cup ~
4. The best meal is:

"與宜蘭小賴有約～
小賴呢？是個我蠻有趣的朋友
大家都說他長相高冷
高不可攀像個仙女般的模樣

還記得用餐當天午餐先去吃了20盎司的牛小排，接著又來了一個巧巴達夾著3.5盎司的肉，下午時分去南京復興星巴克Shot掉兩杯新品，最後來到期貨大樓等待著我的朋友小賴，看到咳嗽重感冒的他屬實是有點心疼，趕緊來到瑪黑遮風避雨一番。

由於午餐實在是吃了太多食物，來到瑪黑只好意思意思點到低消水準，不然平時的我肯定是直接暴風式點餐一輪。當天點了一道湯、一個前菜跟兩盤主餐，還有點了一瓶氣泡水。玉米湯結合了上頭的焦糖，讓風味更濃郁更甜，差點以為在喝牛奶糖飲料；牛舌掛包燉到軟爛，對！不是軟嫩是偏軟爛的那種口感，感覺舌頭稍稍用力就能把牛舌頂穿的那種模樣，比起這種軟爛系牛舌，我還是更愛脆口彈牙、肉汁四溢的厚切牛舌舌根。

接著來談談大家最喜歡點來拍照打卡的兩盤主餐，海膽干貝燉飯嚐起來不難吃，真材實料有放上海膽跟干貝，雖然海膽的品質可能不是很好，不過干貝熟度煎的恰到好處，當天最滿意的非這盤莫屬了。至於軟殼蟹義大利麵，帶點微微辣度的扁麵，上面放一隻軟殼蟹，硬是將兩個沒關係點食物結合起來，這道我並不是很愛，但可能是因為我午餐吃的太飽了，所以評價有失公允。

除了食物還有價錢外，整體環境、氣氛都是相當不錯，很值得推薦的。位子坐起來十分舒適外，還能跟許久未見上一面的朋友聊聊天，我覺得當天心情十分開心～～～","Have an appointment with Yilan Xiao Lai ~
What about Xiao Lai?It's a friend I am quite interesting
Everyone said he looks cold
Highly unable to climb like a fairy
But in my eyes he is really 87 and funny

I still remember to eat 20 ounces of cow pows ​​for lunch on the day of dinner, and then a Qiao Bada was holding 3.5 ounces of meat. In the afternoon, I went to Nanjing Fuxing Starbucks Shot to drop two new cups of new products. My friend Xiao Lai, seeing a cough and a cold, he was really painful. He quickly came to Ma Hei to cover the wind and avoid rain.

Since lunch is really eating too many foods, I came to Ma Hei to think about the low level, otherwise I would definitely order a round of dinner directly.On the same day, I ordered a soup, a front dish and a two -plate meal, and a bottle of bottle of bubbles.The corn soup combines the caramel above, making the flavor more rich and sweeter. I almost thought that I was drinking milk sugar drinks;Not soft and tender, it is a soft and rotten taste. It feels like the tongue can be worn with a little force. Compared with this soft rotten beef tongue, I still love crispy bouncing teeth and gravy overflowing. Thick -cut beef tongue roots.

Then come to talk about the two main meals that you like to take pictures and punch cards. The sea urchin scallop stew is not unpalatable. The real material is that the quality of Shanghai gall and scallops. Although the quality of the sea urchin may not be very good, the shells are familiar with the shells are cooked. Du Jian is just right, the most satisfied that day is the case.As for the sprouts of the soft shell crab, a flat surface with a slightly spicy degree, a soft shell crab on it, just combining the two foods that it doesn't matter. It is too full, so the evaluation is not fair.

In addition to food, the overall environment and atmosphere are quite good, it is worth recommending.The seat is very comfortable, and I can chat with friends who have not seen the previous side for a long time. I think I was very happy that day ~~~",False

另外干貝也很大顆又鮮甜，表面煎得剛剛好，裡面還是超級軟嫩

小缺點是覺得醬汁和柚子的搭配有點奇怪，可能是為了解膩所以加柚子？
但合在一起吃會覺得柚子味道太突兀也不搭，後來自己把柚子都挑掉就變好吃了哈哈
吃多了可能會膩，建議跟朋友一起分

✔️酥炸軟殼蟹辣椒細扁麵 $480

In addition, the scallops are also very large and sweet, and the surface is just fried. It is still super soft inside.

The small disadvantage is that the matching of sauce and grapefruit is a bit strange. Maybe it is to add greasy to add grapefruit?
But eating together will feel that the taste of grapefruit is too abrupt, and then it will not match the grapefruit.

餐點（都還好）：
1 關於傳達問題，我們有點刈包，也說了不要香菜，店員也有複誦一次確認，結果來了還是有香菜，真蠻不懂的，而且是牛舌刈包，但吃起來沒有牛舌味
2 點了一碗$460的湯，量連魚肉都沒有蓋過去
3 主要是水要開瓶費$140，只有4杯喔：）））我們那天去5個人，真的點不下去，畢竟點了還不夠全部人喝😻（可能我們是鄉巴佬吧，以為水基本上是免費的ㄏ⋯見到世面了）

Cake cannot be inserted).The result == The cake has not been served 30 minutes before the end of the meal time, and we want to remind us, what is the meaning of the beginning?The point is that Qianjiao has a generation, don't help me remove the things above!As a result, they were still removed. Is there any problem with this communication? Fortunately, there is no candle, otherwise a cake of $ 2900 will be destroyed :) Really unhappy

1 Regarding the problem of conveying, we are a little bit of baggage, and we also say that no coriander is required.
At 2 o'clock a bowl of $ 460 soup, the amount of fish did not cover the fish
3 The main reason is that the water is about $ 140, there are only 4 cups :))) We went to 5 people that day, and we really couldn't order it. After all, it was not enough to drink it. It's free, see the world)

Conclusion: One of the least pushing restaurants in history",False
"到訪之前先爬文做了功課，列出很多人推薦的餐點：【海膽燉飯】、【軟殼蟹扁麵】、【金沙炸雞】、【紅心芭樂】

看完菜單後決定多點一道湯：【甜玉米湯】，口感非常特別，喝之前要先把上面的殼敲破一起喝，裡面還有蒸蛋（是甜的），喝了幾口之後就感覺有點膩，可能是因為我不太喜歡吃甜的

這幾道菜裡面最喜歡的是海膽燉飯，燉飯粒粒分明但米心又不會太生卡牙齒，魚卵跟海膽也增加了燉飯的層次感

第二是軟殼蟹扁麵，小辣所以很開胃，軟殼蟹一個人吃掉一隻會有點膩，兩個人分差不多

金沙炸雞讓我有點失望，炸雞本身好吃，但金沙醬很膩，反而沒有鹹蛋清爽的感覺，東泉辣椒醬倒是挺特別，不會扣分。

甜點紅心芭樂非常讓人驚豔，吃了前幾道菜之後對甜點其實不太抱有期待，但切下去吃了第一口卻讓人眼睛一亮，好香好好吃！外層是棉花糖，卻不會太過甜膩，搭配內餡一起吃真的好棒，而且旁邊的雪酪也很好吃！就是水果本身的甜香味，那一小顆雪酪非常解膩。","Before the visit, I climbed the text to do my homework, and listed the meals recommended by many people: [sea urchin stewed rice], [soft shell crab flat noodles], [golden sand fried chicken], [red heart guava]

After watching the menu, decide to have more soups: [Sweet Corn Soup], the taste is very special. Before drinking, you must knock on the shell above and drink together. There are steamed eggs (sweet). It feels a bit tired, maybe because I don’t like sweetness

The favorite of these dishes is sea urchin stewed rice. The stewed rice is clear but rice heart will not be too raw to teeth.

The second is the flat surface of the soft shell crab, which is small, so it is very appetizing. A soft shell crab will eat one and one person will be a bit greasy.

The golden sand fried chicken was a little disappointed. The fried chicken itself was delicious, but the golden sand sauce was very greasy. Instead, there was no salty egg refreshing. Dongquan chili sauce was quite special and would not deduct points.

The dessert red heart guava is very amazing. After eating the first few dishes, I don't have much expectation for the desserts, but after cutting it, the first mouth is brightened, so delicious!The outer layer is marshmallow, but it will not be too sweet. It is really good to eat with the stuffing, and the snow cheese next to it is also delicious!It is the sweet aroma of the fruit itself, and the small snowy cheese is very greasy.",False
"調酒很好喝，喜歡海膽燉飯和仁當牛，但除此之外沒有太多驚艷之處。

"大約至少三週前就滿懷期待訂了位， 所以到了以後被安排在一進來的吧台邊有點意外。後來更發現後面和旁邊都有空桌子，說實話心裡有點彆扭。

除此之外一切都還算滿意- 馬告薯條的薯條本身很普通，但是夠熱夠燙沾醬又很好吃加了不少分。小卷名堂很多又很鮮甜軟嫩、牛舌掛包創意十足口感也好、house wine有點水但很很好入口。伊比利豬有焦香味卻一點都不乾硬，是我今晚最滿意的一道菜。

最後的酪梨甜點就當作是嚐鮮了- 似乎是用酪梨泥和白巧克力重塑半片酪梨的形狀，吃起來是苦甜苦甜的酪梨牛奶巧克力冰淇淋之類很ㄏㄧ 花的一道甜點。不過冰得很硬要用力切開挖著吃，搞到最後亂七八糟的很像一盤炒飯😅

服務生都很友善熱情，沒有遇到什麼大問題。頂多就是因為座位在吧台和接待區邊邊的關係，感覺好像她們一直在我的頭上講話一樣。

我通常不喜歡fusion 或是分子料理這種很假鬼假怪的菜式， 瑪黑好像有點這種味道但是拿捏得很好。還想再去吃別道菜, hopefully at a decent table tho.","At least three weeks ago, I was looking forward to booked, so it was a bit surprised by being arranged at the bar in the bar.Later, there was an empty table behind and next to it, and to be honest, I was a little awkward.

The last avocado dessert is used as an early-tasting-it seems to use avocado mud and white chocolate to reshape the shape of half tablets of avocado. dessert.But Ice is very hard to cut hard and dug it, so I finally mess like a plate of fried rice.

⑧酥炸軟殼蟹辣椒細扁麵
(是拉差/羽衣甘藍/香菜苗)
軟殼蟹的部分我覺得沒有非常的酥脆 但是咬起來還是很香 再來是麵條 他是微辣 不會到很辣 所以香氣是比較重的 非常好吃的麵 那醬汁很香 整體咬起來都很入味很香
⑨紅心芭樂
(紅心芭樂雪酪/瑞可達慕斯/紅心芭樂海綿)
我覺得那上面的冰真的很好吃 可是就只有這個冰比較好吃其他還好 要280真的有點貴 況且份量很少 感覺是一人份的樣子 下次想來點釋迦與接骨木哈哈 感覺照片看起來好吃很多

這間店一定會二訪阿 完全不用多說
服務好就算了 服務生也都是氣質姊姊～
雖然價格是一般餐酒偏高 可是真的很值得
總比去一間什麼餐點都普通的餐酒來的好！
然後也讓人覺得很高級又很有氣氛🤪

原本要點生牛肉塔塔(是拉差/越南河粉/溏心蛋黃)還有甜玉米湯(玉米脆餅/鴨肝蒸蛋)還有口水雞沙拉(紅油/蘿蔓/龍鬚菜/川香胡麻醬/老油條)但是都沒有了哭哭 下次點好點滿！","① fried fries
(Ma Jue Chili Sauce)
The first French fries surprised me that the sauce was really delicious. Let me get the fries to the shot.
② Roasted sweet shrimp salad
(Shrimp by Dutch sauce/grapefruit oil vinegar/catfish egg)
I think this is actually okay. It ’s not particularly amazing. Originally, I wanted to order water chicken salad, but I did n’t want to say it.
③ Small roll Neritic Squid
(Pearl rice/clam foam/fennel head/Ibilia sausage)
This is very, very delicious, small rolls, and the fragrance of charcoal grilled is very tender. The fleshy meat is also matched with pearl rice. It is very special.
④ Ghost Head Tower MAHI-MAHI TACO
(Sour pickles/green onion cakes/mustard leaves)
I think this is also very delicious, very special, very super particularly, and there is a feeling of merging between China and the West. The point is that I am a person who does n’t eat sashimi sashimi. I can accept this fish. The cooked onion cake is super delicious and the white sauce is so delicious
⑤ Rendang Beef
(Rendang/beef tendon & beef tongue/nitrogen potato/naked wheat bread)
I personally think that this is also very delicious, but the potato is not light enough to bubble light or light. It feels like potato puree, but the beef is super delicious. The sauce is very delicious. With potato puree and bite the whole delicious food on the bread, I feel that it is not enough to be beef, and it feels like a bowl of white rice. I think it makes it into a beef
⑥ cooked duck breast AGING Duck Breast
This personally thinks it is okay. Then my friend doesn't like meat that is more than a little bit of skin and too fat, so it's not easy to bite the sauce next to the sauce is sweet potato mud and it is too sour. I don’t like it so much.
⑦ sea urchin stewed rice
(Dry scallops/grapefruit/white wine fish and egg sauce)
I am a person who does not eat scallops nor sea urchin, but this is very delicious and fragrant, and there will be no fishy smell. I think it ’s very milk and super delicious.
Crispy soft -shell crab pepper fine flat noodles
(It is the lattice/feather coat cabbage/coriander seedlings)
I don't think the part of the soft shell crab is very crispy, but the bite is still very fragrant. The noodles are slightly spicy. Flavorful
⑨ ⑨ 乐 ⑨

I think the ice on it is really delicious, but only this ice is more delicious. Other than 280 is really expensive, and the portion rarely feels like one person. Next time, I want to come to a little Sakyama and bone wood haha. It looks a lot delicious

This store will definitely visit Ah. I do n’t need to say more at all

☑海膽燉飯💰620  = 干貝很漂亮，但口感稍嫌軟爛，凍壞了😆?? 淋上白酒魚卵醬汁，我們太機歪說白酒醬要多一點，結果果然奶味重，番茄海膽鹽跟柚子風味有點被壓制，自己的鍋，6分。

又香又辣的醬麵，不用挑殼的超酥炸蟹，對我來說是偏重口味的一道，但很過癮。

*干貝燉飯（對，沒海膽）
說來有點傻眼，我是蠻期待這道干貝海膽燉飯的，燉飯上桌後，服務員另外在面前淋上白酒魚卵醬，因為沒看到海膽，我隨口問了：海膽是拌在裡面了嗎？(因為沒看到它)這時服務員驚回：點餐時沒說今天食材沒海膽嗎？！(市場沒買到) 我：…沒有。
點餐跟送餐的服務員是不同位，我也不好說什麼，當時送餐的服務員也是很抱歉的問說要不要換餐，或燉飯會少收100元。總之我當然還是吃了，雖然沒海膽，但硬度剛好的燉飯粒粒飽滿，搭配偏白醬的口味，還有幾條柚子絲點綴味蕾，給鮮美的干貝們一個和諧的展現舞台。

很紮實的厚切，肉質鮮美，其中讓我驚艷的是旁襯的玉米粒，有另外炒過，又香又甜，可以緩衝一下滿口的肉味。

*法式甜甜圈
圓狀甜圈裡是像奶油的流餡，我個人比較喜歡旁邊的威士忌冰淇淋。(因為有壽星，有附上一根蠟燭插在小點心上，另外還有送一個shot)
吃到尾巴甜點這道時，感覺到整頓下來幾乎都吃到以奶油(白醬)為基底的餐點，頓時覺得有點膩，但還是不錯吃，食材都很新鮮。

這是降二級開放內用後的第一餐外食，可能餐廳內用停擺了一陣子服務也稍顯生疏，第一道菜上來時桌上沒任何餐具，還要另外招手麻煩服務員送上，還有燉飯沒海膽事件，確實有點扣分，但想想疫情期間餐飲業也是很辛苦，好不容易撐到現在，當然還是滿心感恩的享受著這些美食佳餚～

是會再光顧的bistro！(這次沒喝到酒）","*Carbon grilled seafood avocado salad
The seafood I ate has soy sauce. It is very slippery and the mouth is very fragrant and amazing. The cookedness of the avocado pieces will not be too soft. It is a good start as an appetizing salad.

*Crispy soft shell crab pepper fine flat noodles
The fragrant and spicy sauce noodles, the super crispy fried crab without shelling is a good taste for me, but it is very enjoyable.

*Dry scallop stew (yes, no sea urchin)
It's a bit dumbfounded. I look forward to this dried shells of sea urchin stew. After stewing the rice, the waiter drizzled with white wine and fish egg sauce. Because I didn't see sea urchins, I asked casually: Is it?(Because I didn't see it) At this time, the waiter was shocked: Didn't you say that the ingredients did not have sea urchin today when ordering?Intersection(I haven't bought the market) Me: ... No.
Ordering the waiter for meals is different, and I was hard to say anything. At that time, the waiter who delivered meals was also sorry to ask if they should change the meal, or the stew will receive 100 yuan less.In short, of course, I still eat it. Although there is no sea urchin, the stewed rice is full of hardness, with the flavor of white sauce, and a few grapefruit jinyed flavors, giving the delicious shells a harmonious show stage.

*duck breast
It is very solid and thick, and the meat is delicious. What surprises me is the corn kernels lined with. There are other frying, fragrant and sweet, which can cushion the flavor of the full mouth.

*French donut
The round donut is like cream stuffing. I personally prefer the whiskey ice cream next to it.(Because there are Shouxing, a candle is attached to the snacks, and there is also a shot.)
When I ate the tail dessert, I felt that I almost ate the meal with cream (white sauce) as the base. I immediately felt a little greasy, but it was still good and the ingredients were fresh.

This is the first meal after the second -level opening and inside meal. It may be slightly sparse that the service in the restaurant for a while is also slightly sparse. When the first dish is on the table, there is no tableware on the table. There is also an incident of stew without sea urchin, which is indeed a bit deducted, but it is also very hard to think about the catering industry during the epidemic.

一直在口袋名單中，但因為疫情遲遲沒有行動，最近和好友突然想起瑪黑的海膽燉飯，馬上預約起來。晚上六點才開始營業，早到可以去前面的瑪黑家居看看，家居裡面的選物很美很好拍，店員們也都親切接待。逛逛家居一到營業時間立刻回到餐廳，因為疫情的關係，不同的桌與桌之間有做透明擋板，還有同桌之間也是有放小型擋板並採以梅花座形式，服務生們也都戴上口罩、面罩以及手套，讓人好安心。今天主菜點了招牌的海鮮干貝燉飯、服務生推薦的伊比利老饕，前菜一開始在猶豫要小卷還是淡菜，但服務生推薦口味比較重的小卷～另外還有碳烤海鮮酪梨沙拉、紅茶以及甜點選擇了紅心芭樂與焦糖威士忌的冰淇淋🍦碳烤海鮮酪梨沙拉的油醋醬非常棒，微酸淡雅的味道帶出海鮮的甜，裡面有小卷、蝦子，酪梨(超大塊)，我個人討厭沙拉醬太酸會讓菜苦苦的，這應該是台北最好吃的油醋醬沙拉了！小卷上面有一層泡泡，服務生說是蛤蜊分子泡泡，我個人嘴殘吃不出奧妙：）但是鋪在小卷下面的番茄肉醬珍珠米宇宙好吃，可以單點一份來吃那種好吃。伊比利老饕的醬汁也是非常厲害，有雞汁以及芹菜根醬，肉質鮮嫩，單吃時十分美味。海膽干貝燉飯上菜時，服務生會現場為你淋上白醬，點這道朋友很喜愛，我吃了干貝也覺得不錯，另外提醒這米芯是偏硬的，如果不習慣道地作法可以在點菜時請餐廳調整。紅茶的部分很普通哈哈但回沖兩次還是有味道這點不錯。最後的冰淇淋讓我驚喜不已，本來是期待紅心芭樂，但兩球都吃過後，發現焦糖威士忌超級濃郁香醇，太喜歡了❤️要再來把其他有興趣的餐點吃遍，感覺應該會有二三四五訪，疫情快退散啦！！！,"I have been in the pocket list, but because of the late epidemic, I recently remembered Ma Hei's sea urchin stewed rice, and immediately made an appointment.It started to open at 6 pm.

Because of the epidemic, there are transparent baffles between different tables and tables, as well as small baffles between the same table and adopting plums in the form of plum seats to serve the service. All the students also put on masks, masks and gloves, which makes people feel at ease.Today, the main dish ordered the signature seafood scallop stew rice and recommended by the waiter. The former dish was hesitant or light vegetables at first, but the waiter recommends a small roll of taste. In addition, there are carbon roasted seafood cheese Pear salad, black tea, and dessert chose the ice cream of red -hearted guava and caramel whiskers. Pear (oversized), I personally hate that salad sauce is too sour to make the vegetables bitter. This should be the best oily vinegar sauce salad in Taipei!There is a layer of bubbles on the small roll. The waiter said that it was a toad molecule bubble. I personally couldn't eat the mysteries :) But the tomato meat sauce below the small roll was delicious. Falling delicious.The sauce of the old Ibilia is also very powerful. There are chicken sauce and celery root sauce. The meat is tender and delicious when eating alone.When the sea urchin dried scallop stew, the waiter will pour the white sauce on the scene. I like this friend very much. I also feel good when I ate the shellfish. In addition, I remind the core of the rice. You can adjust the restaurant when ordering.The black tea part is very ordinary haha, but it still tastes good at the twice.The last ice cream surprised me.

甜玉米湯有驚艷，喝得出純粹的玉米甜，加上鴨肝的，整體很搭，是一碗很有存在感的湯。燻鴨胸沙拉很普通，只有薄薄的幾片鴨肉，可以不用點直接跳過。前菜類的麻辣牛舌掛包是今天第二道喜歡的，牛舌很厚，麻辣也帶著甜味，掛包也不忘花生粉，一份兩個掛包份量很不錯；前菜2是蔥油餅鴨肉，也是覺得普通；前菜3是烤章魚，份量還不錯，炸麵疙瘩，可以試試看。主餐是海膽燉飯，飯的口感還不錯，是及格的燉飯，有三顆干貝，海膽也是有整個出現，算是還不錯。肉類主餐是伊比利豬，覺得處理的太老了，吃不出伊比利豬的嫩以及油脂香。甜點選擇酪梨冰糕，也有驚艷，酪梨造型的冰糕，外層綠色的是酪梨，中間黃色部分是檸檬，盤上的白色碎片也是冰，整體吃起來很清爽有驚喜。調酒類都很淡，味道也很普通，價格也高，可以不用點。,"Sweet corn soup is amazing.

很舒適的環境，餐具也是很美，現場所使用的餐具一旁都有販賣，像是旁邊設計感十足的玻璃杯，價格是380，不會太貴差點失心瘋買回家！

可能是新開幕的關係人員的服務還不算太熟練但還可以接受的程度，食材部分可以感覺到很用心.
這次我們倆位女生都是點套餐，套餐是880一成服務費，可以選湯品或沙拉，主菜麵或燉飯還有其他的沒特別記，最後還有飲品可自由挑選，
這次我是衝著海膽蝦細扁麵來的～

朋友點的是蟹腳燉飯，上菜時服務人員會在客人面前淋上醬汁，看起來十分療癒之外香味四溢口水直流.
海膽鮮蝦細扁麵上面是完整的一塊塊海膽，而不是呼嚨的海膽醬，太感人了！
這兩道主菜味道都是偏濃郁的，所以我們加點了白酒，整個大大的享受，不喝酒的人建議點茶品才不會整體過於濃郁複雜.

這次著重在食物的部分沒有很用心品嚐飲料，下次再來好好的研究茶品的部分～
份量部分一般女生吃是可以很飽足的，男生或食量較大的女生可能會需要加點其他小前菜！

*小小建議就是沙拉盤太輕了所以在食用時會轉來轉去，換一個就完美了！","520 first visit ~

It may be that the service of the newly opened relationship personnel is not too skilled but acceptable. The ingredients can feel very careful.
This time, both of our girls are some set meals. The package is 880 % of the service fee. You can choose soup or salad. There are no special remembers in the main dish noodles or stewed rice. In the end
This time I came to the fine flat noodles of the sea urchin shrimp ~

The friend ordered the crab feet stewed rice. When serving, the service staff will drizzle the sauce in front of the guests.
The fine flat surface of the sea urchins is a complete piece of sea urchin instead of the sea urchin sauce, which is too touching!
These two main dishes have a strong taste, so we add some liquor and enjoy the whole great enjoyment. People who do not drink are recommended to order tea to be too rich and complicated.

This time, I did not taste the drinks in the food. I will study the part of the tea next time ~
Some girls can be satisfactory when they eat some girls. Boys or girls with a large amount of food may need to add other small front dishes!

很多酒可以選擇所以我喜歡這個地方:)","Spacious and elegant interior design
The taste is great and the service is great.Some dishes are not very hot.
Many wines can choose so I like this place :)",False
"味道不僅好而且很西式。
周圍的裝飾有點暗。
總的來說，我真的很喜歡在這裡吃晚餐。","The taste is not only good but also Western style.
The surrounding decoration is a bit dark.
In general, I really like dinner here.",False
"工作人員非常友好，並給出了真誠的建議！
海膽燴飯很好吃🤩我都忘了拍照了！
說實話，我們點的每一樣東西都很美味！強烈推薦！ ！ …","The staff is very friendly and gives sincere suggestions!
Introduction to sea urchin risks is delicious. I forgot to take pictures!
To be honest, everything we ordered is delicious!Recommended strongly!IntersectionMowing",False
不是在那裡吃晚餐，而是喝深夜雞尾酒。多麼有品味、美味和轟動的火花，讓週末變得更加完美。,"It's not to have dinner there, but drinking the cocktail late at night.How delicious, delicious and sensational sparks make the weekend more perfect.",False
這是鎮上的一顆寶石，食物都很棒，還有很棒的雞尾酒！服務和氛圍都很棒，更不用說它物有所值👍🏻 …,"This is a gem in the town, the food is great, and there are great cocktails!The service and atmosphere are great, let alone it is worth it ...",False
下次不會了，服務很差，只有脆皮食物好吃，這是台灣最好吃的脆皮食物。  其他食物真的很糟糕，尤其是鴨胸肉。  我從來沒看過鴨胸肉能切這麼厚。對於沒有服務和如此糟糕的食物的餐廳來說，這絕對是價格過高。我們還點了一瓶葡萄酒，服務生推薦了一瓶絕對是軟木塞的葡萄酒。  服務生堅持說酒很好，需要時間。  一小時後，味道仍然像醋。  我們沒有吃完酒和食物。  我們離開了，服務員甚至沒有問我們為什麼沒有完成任何東西就離開了。  我無法想像他們為什麼能在Google獲得如此高的評價。  一定是假評論。,"I won't be next time, the service is very poor, only crispy food is delicious. This is the best crispy food in Taiwan.Other foods are really bad, especially duck breasts.I have never seen duck breasts that can be cut so thick.For restaurants without services and such bad foods, this is definitely too high.We also ordered a bottle of wine, and the waiter recommended a bottle of wine that is definitely cork.The waiter insists that the wine is good and takes time.After an hour, the taste is still vinegar.We didn't finish wine and food.We left, and the waiter didn't even ask us why we left without finishing anything.I can't imagine why they can get such a high evaluation at Google.It must be fake comments.",False
"地方不錯，酒好，菜好，氣氛好~推薦和朋友或家人一起去。  還有適合兒童的餐廳。

美食推薦：松露和牛麵太好吃了😋 …","The place is good, the wine is good, the dishes are good, the atmosphere is good ~ recommended to go with friends or family members.There are also restaurants suitable for children.

Gourmet recommendation: Truel and Niu Niu Noodles are so delicious 😋 ...",False
價格有點高，喜歡蝦餃（一定要嘗試）。義大利調味飯的調味非常完美，而義大利麵中的蝦子則非常出色！,"The price is a bit high, I like shrimp dumplings (be sure to try).The seasoning of Italian seasonings is perfect, while the shrimp in the Italian noodles is very good!",False
"小酒館和我預期的一樣好。

食物🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Uni risotto 是奶油味的，不鹹。
味道很棒。
魷魚、和牛牛排、咖哩牛肉配馬鈴薯泥、玉米筍配鵝肝等。
DC的一切都很好

或許是因為我帶的甜點蛋糕實在是鋪天蓋地，所以寫成法式甜甜圈的甜點影響力比主菜小一點。

服務🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
他們甚至還準備了你帶來的甜點蛋糕（不收取清潔費）。
因為那天是我的生日，他們還提供了 Gojin Gamrae 版本（？）的雞尾酒。
自釀葡萄酒的價格也很合理。

非常滿意","The tavern is as good as I expected.

Food 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Uni Risotto is creamy, not salty.
The taste is great.
Squid, peace steak, curry beef with potato puree, corn bamboo shoots with foie gras.
Everything in DC is very good

Perhaps it is because the dessert cake I brought is really overwhelming, so the influence of desserts written as French donuts is smaller than the main course.

Serving
They even prepared the dessert cake you brought by you (no cleaning fee).
Because it was my birthday that day, they also provided the cocktail of Gojin Gamrae version (?).
The price of self -brewed wine is also reasonable.

Very satisfied",False
鴨子很好吃，儘管我通常不喜歡鴨子和咖啡的味道。很棒的茶基雞尾酒。不過服務還可以。沒什麼好怕的，但通常很難引起女服務員的注意。,"The ducks are delicious, although I usually don't like the taste of ducks and coffee.Great tea -based cocktail.But the service is okay.There is nothing to be afraid, but it is usually difficult to attract the attention of female waiters.",False
他們需要培訓員工如何提供適當的服務並與客戶溝通。他們沒有費心向我們介紹任何菜餚，只是一直強調有最低限度，而且水只能瓶裝。我們沒有嘗試就遠遠超出了最低要求，因為菜餚很小而且價格過高，所以我不確定他們為什麼如此擔心任何顧客都無法滿足最低要求。最重要的是，當我預訂時，他們向我收取了押金，我很確定押金超出了法定限額，而且我沒有費心與他們爭論。再也不會回到這個地方了。台灣有太多其他不錯的餐廳知道如何提供適當的服務。,"They need to train employees how to provide appropriate services and communicate with customers.They did not bother to introduce to us any dishes, but they always emphasized that there is a minimum, and water can only be bottle.We did not try to exceed the minimum requirements, because the dishes were small and the price was too high, so I was not sure why they were so worried that any customer could not meet the minimum requirements.The most important thing is that when I reservations, they collected the deposit to me, and I was sure that the deposit was exceeded that the statutory limit was exceeded, and I didn't worry about arguing with them.I won't go back to this place anymore.There are too many other good restaurants in Taiwan to know how to provide appropriate services.",False
喜歡義大利調味飯和辣雞肉沙拉！牛排也不錯，但就品質而言太貴了。雞尾酒還可以。,"Like Italian seasoning rice and spicy chicken salad!The steak is also good, but the quality is too expensive.Cocktails are ok.",False
"嗯，我不喜歡我點的雞尾酒。
但休息很好，說實話，食物比我想像的好！","Well, I don't like the cocktail I ordered.

我很高興嘗試這個地方來慶祝我的生日。由於糟糕和粗魯的服務，這是一個巨大的失望。我們不斷被提醒用餐時間有 2 小時限制。沒有人承認這是一個生日慶祝活動，也沒有問我們是否想要點一份小蛋糕或甜點。好吧，我們在 1 小時 45 分鐘點任何甜點之前就被要求騰出桌子（當時沒有人在等桌子）。食物很不錯，但不幸的是，粗魯的工作人員毀了整個用餐體驗。你的服務與上次的服務一樣好 - 我不會推薦這個地方。,"I am glad to try this place to celebrate my birthday.This is a huge disappointment due to bad and rude services.We are constantly reminded that the meal time is 2 hours limit.No one admits that this is a birthday celebration, and we don't ask if we want to order a small cake or dessert.Well, we were required to free up the table before taking any dessert at 1 hour and 45 minutes (no one was waiting for the table at the time).The food is very good, but unfortunately, the rude staff ruined the entire dining experience.Your service is as good as the last service -I will not recommend this place.",False

裝飾和氛圍都很好，但座位有點擁擠，不舒服。牡蠣超級新鮮，調味也很好。生魚片很溫暖，不知道是不是本來就是這樣的……軟蟹扁麵條對我個人來說太鹹了。烤/烤魚很普通。,"The decoration and atmosphere are good, but the seat is a bit crowded and uncomfortable.Oyster is super fresh and seasonings are also very good.The sashimi is very warm.

從他們那裡訂購了沙拉。很好吃，但相對於價格來說，份量太小了。你幾乎可以數出裡面有多少片葉子。它至少需要兩倍的份量，這就是它的小量。絕對不想再去那裡了。,"Ordered salad from them.It is delicious, but compared to the price, the portion is too small.You can almost count how many leaves there are.It requires at least twice the amount, which is its small amount.Never want to go there again.",False
