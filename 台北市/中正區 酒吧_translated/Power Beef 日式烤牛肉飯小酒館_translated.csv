招牌牛肉丼完美無瑕推薦必點！牛舌香氣十足但是有一半是有點咬不太動，雖然部位不同但命中率有點高，但還是推薦大家嘗試看看,"Signature beef 丼 Perfect and flawless recommendation must order!The beef tongue is full of aroma but half of the bitter bite. Although the location is different, the hit rate is a bit high, but I still recommend everyone to try it.",False
"這是一家很習慣的愛店，禮拜天二個人剛好經過沒預約的情況下很幸運地坐到吧台。位置算舒適。

這次我們一開始沒有點飯，而是一大堆單點。從結論上來說不太建議，雖然很好吃，但比較高C P值的，實在是在丼飯。

請注意和牛肉壽司是沒有飯的！這點員工有很詳細跟我們解釋，非常好吃，可以看圖參考。價格當然小貴，但這就是和牛。

明太子豆腐在他推薦的菜單裡面，我們都超愛。推薦加點。

個人覺得牛舌份量有點少，而且他吵得有點過熟，但這是個人喜好問題，還是很好吃，很愛的人還是可以點。

因以上實在是吃不飽，就受不了多點了一個松阪豬丼飯，因為每次來都是吃牛肉，所以想要吃看豬，結論是也非常好吃，量也很ok，看圖都知道快爆出來了。飯會附個沙拉。

實用建議是，這家店算蠻熱門的，重要聚餐宜先訂位，而且，請注意只接受現金跟台灣pay！沒有信用卡linepay喔。","This is a very habitual shop. The two people were lucky to sit in the bar when they were not reserved.The location is comfortable.

This time we didn't have any food at the beginning, but a lot of single points.In conclusion, it is not recommended. Although it is delicious, it is relatively high C p value.

Please note that there is no rice with beef sushi!This employee has explained it in detail. It is very delicious and you can see the picture for reference.The price is of course small, but this is Hetao.

In the menu he recommended, Prince Ming Crown Tofu we all love.Recommended adding points.

Personally, I think that the amount of beef tongue is a bit less, and he is a bit too familiar, but this is a personal preference problem. It is still delicious.

Because the above is really not full, I can't stand a lot of Matsusaka pig rice rice. Because every time I come to eat beef, I want to eat pigs. The conclusion is also very delicious and the amount is OK. Look at the picture. Everyone knows that it will burst out.The meal will attach a salad.

The practical suggestion is that this shop is quite popular. Important dinner should be booked first, and please pay attention to accept only cash and Taiwan Pay!There is no credit card LINEPAY.",False
"環境：小小的店，有二樓但沒上去，一樓的座位還算寬敞舒適，週一晚上用餐沒什麽客人，所以很安靜。

餐點：真的真的好好吃!!!很推薦烤牛肉炒麵，無敵美味，網路推薦的炸豬排三明治也超級好吃，明太子玉子豆腐唯一的缺點，居然是明太子給太多(店家也太佛心)，其他餐點都無雷，吃得很滿意，唯一只有一道塔香油條松阪豬，口味偏重，但如果有白飯的話超搭的。水蜜桃沙瓦好好喝，還有大片結冰水蜜桃可以吃，誠意十足。
布丁口感紮實，因為吃太飽所以有點吃不太下。

服務：店內服務人員很親切說明餐點，也有推薦品項，加水次數很勤，後來加點無酒精飲料紫蘇梅氣泡飲，但告知說因為沒有紫蘇梅糖漿無法製作，反而幫我客製了百香果氣泡飲，非常感謝。

The pudding taste is solid, because it is too full, so I ca n’t eat it.

"[特色]這次用餐點了豬排定食和三色丼，豬排定食上餐時附上了油醋高麗菜、白飯、豆腐、味噌湯和小松菜，豬排口感紮實，麵衣脫離，在食用時因為沒有額外的蘸醬，所以吃到第三塊後就嫌無聊。白飯口感不錯，小菜表現出色。吃到第四塊後，詢問店家是否有佐料，店家才拿出了芝麻磨缽與豬排醬，整體表現才漸入佳境。三色丼的由海膽、牛排與魚子和蛋黃組成，根據用餐者表示，初入口感覺豐富，吃到後期味道混合變得複雜。

"第一次吃牛肉丼飯的體驗送給power beef!
個人因為不是肉品愛好者，在朋友推薦下前來一試。

店面是老屋改建，木材餐桌椅、磚瓦、鐵窗花以及長吧台上面手寫黑板字，都讓用餐感覺舒適。

Personally, because it is not a meat lover, come and try it under the recommendation of a friend.

Because the beef does not eat much, the intuitive feeling is that the signature beef is better than other items.

It is very satisfying after eating.

"週日8點抵達，烤牛肉品項已全部完售，殘念。
點了牛肋條丼飯、橫隔膜丼飯、清燉牛筋、番茄牛舌、2杯生啤。
餐點有一定品質但可惜吃不出牛肉該部位口感，原本期待富含纖維質的橫隔膜吃起來略有嚼勁，入口咀嚼後油花散開遍布滿口牛肉香，但沒有，吃起來就一般牛肉。
牛肋條丼飯的沾醬很特別，一樣沒有牛肋條該有的特色。
番茄牛舌調味不錯，很是下飯，起士鹹香，可惜也沒有牛舌應有的脆度，已將牛舌滷到軟爛入口即化，換言之吃不出是牛舌，其它牛肉部位皆可成就此道料理，但我是想吃牛舌口感才點的。
清燉牛筋完美！下次如再訪絕對是為了它，可以點三盤+白飯就好，一個人就嗑光光 XD

The dipping sauce of beef ribs is very special, and there is no characteristic that the ribs should have.
Tomato beef tongue flavoring is good, it is very delicious, the cheese is salty, but unfortunately there is no crispyness that the beef tongue should have, and the beef tongue has been softened to the soft entrance. In other words, it can not be eaten. But this dish is achieved, but I want to eat beef tongue.
Stewed beef tendon is perfect!The next time you visit again, it is definitely for it. You can order three plates+rice, and a person will take light XD

"整片的落地窗，可以看到簡潔乾淨的店內空間，是滿溫馨的日式風格小店。

▲店內空間

店內空間與座位並不是非常多，但環境因此更加的簡單舒適，溫馨靜謐的風格，整體來說不會過於吵鬧，很適合朋友談心小酌。

▲吧檯座位

充滿日式風格的吧檯，還可以欣賞到師父的料理過程

▲二樓座位 (酒後不開車，安全有保障。未滿十八歲禁止飲酒。)

二樓有低矮的木質天花板，藤編的座椅，整體日式風格更為濃厚，展櫃上面有滿滿的酒類飲品，在這樣的環境談心小酌非常別具風味。

▲原肉

冰箱內看的到滿滿新鮮的原肉，溫度維持適宜，看的到食材讓人更安心。

▲調味料

每桌都有附上簡單的玫瑰鹽以及胡椒鹽，方便顧客依照自己的口味使用。

▲牛雜味噌煮

牛雜味噌煮裡面有牛筋，牛肚，牛肋條，一端上來就香氣四溢，讓人食指大動，比一般日式味噌料理的香氣更為濃郁，個人最推薦牛筋，他很完美的保留香Q彈的嚼勁，但一點都不會過韌，而且醬汁非常入味，每一口都香氣十足，牛肚與牛肋條的表現也非常完美好吃。

▲土豪丼

土豪丼一端上就金光閃閃、瑞氣千條，視線無法從配色如此美麗的餐點上移開。金箔用的很大片，完全不手軟，除了點綴一大塊的新鮮海膽，鮭魚卵也鋪了不少，可以毫不猶豫地一口配飯一口配卵，最後是整份料理香氣的來源，松露酸奶，讓香氣提升到一個相當高檔的境界，所有看的到的食材都很有檔次，完全無愧土豪的稱呼。

▲土豪丼

海膽真的非常的優質，完全沒有腥味，簡單的海膽鮮香，滑順好吃；金箔本人沒有味道，但覆蓋在肉片上，整個視覺效果大大提升，而牛肉鮮甜香嫩，薄的非常剛好，十分滑嫩；最後搭上滿滿鹹香美味的新鮮鮭魚卵，一顆一顆的在口中爆開，口感超級享受！

▲土豪丼

不得不推這份餐點的松露酸奶醬，看似只是平凡無奇的醬料，但是濃濃的松露味道超級大加分，將奶醬包入肉中，酸酸鹹鹹的味道，濃郁的松露香氣讓人想一口接一口，非常上癮。

▲炸牛排咖哩

炸牛排咖哩不多見，一般來說牛排如果全熟的話應該會乾柴老硬，但這次的牛排完全不會，反倒有將肉汁鎖在肉中，讓炸牛排的香氣能完整保留，紮實的口感，配上外層酥脆的麵皮相當有層次感；醬汁部分略有點辣，味道帶有點滷肉的醬香，淋在白飯上，加上蛋汁更順口！

▲炸雞

炸雞本體是偏甜的味道，底部沾的醬油則是帶是有點醋味。炸雞非常多汁，咬下去還可以看到肉汁流出，上層淋上的醬料裡面有洋蔥跟蛋末，讓味道更加的濃厚豐富，是每一口都可以吃到不同驚喜的小配菜。

▲味噌湯

味噌湯雖然沒有太大的亮點，但也是真材實料，裡面附有新鮮的黃金蜆。

The beef fade miso has beef tendons, beef belly, and beef ribs. The aroma is overflowing on one end, which makes the index finger move. It is more strong than the general Japanese miso dishes. Keep the fragrant Q bomb chewy, but it will not be too tough at all, and the sauce is very flavorful. Each bite is full of aroma.

▲ Local tyrant 丼

On one end of the local tyrants, there are thousands of glittering and srunts, and the sight cannot be removed from such a beautiful meal.The gold foil is very large, and it is not soft at all. In addition to the fresh sea urchins embellished with a large piece of sea urchin, the salmon eggs are also paved a lot. You can match the rice without hesitation. Finally, the source of the whole dish. The aroma was raised to a fairly high -grade realm.

▲ Fried beef steak curry

Fried beef steak curry is rare. Generally speaking, if the steak is cooked, it should be old and hard, but this time the steak is not at all. The taste of the outer layer is quite layered; the sauce part is slightly spicy, the flavor with a bit of sauce with a bit of braised pork, pour on the rice, adds egg juice more smoothly!

The fried chicken is a sweet taste, and the soy sauce on the bottom is a bit vinegar.The fried chicken is very juicy. You can also see the gravy flowing from the bite. There are onions and eggs in the sauce drizzled on the upper layer, so that the taste is stronger and rich. It is a small side dish with different surprises every bite.

"算認真做料理, 可是價位實在太高， 中午有個特餐200元，應該是最不錯的選項。其他的餐點大都在300元到500元之間，餐點內包含一碗味道不錯的味增湯，和小小二口醃漬蘋果，內容單調，以大學男生來講會吃不飽。如果是這個價位，加上非熱鬧地區，餐點內容要更豐富才能吸引人再度上門。

裝潢的倒是認真，氣氛不錯，如果住在附近偶爾想喝杯小酒，點些燒烤的肉，是不錯的選項。

牛舌不錯吃，牛排如果沒有特地跟店家吩咐，是給5分熟，會不好咬，78分熟的反而較香、較好咬。
如果帶長輩來消費，建議點豬肉片，無論是牛排或是牛舌長輩都咬不太動.....

出門左轉有個旅館，下面停車場可停車，是個最大的好處。廁所很臭，內外場工作人員很多，小小一家店，但是生意不夠好，很可能會被人員薪資壓垮的。服務生是年輕妹妹動作太慢，其實只要請一位手腳快的外場工作人員就能夠把事情做好。

The decoration is serious and the atmosphere is good. If you live nearby to drink a glass of wine, or order some grilled meat, it is a good option.

The beef tongue is good. If the steak is not specifically ordered to tell the store, it is cooked for 5 points. It will not be easy to bite.

路過看到建築特別而進去，發現廚師內場均為年輕人抱著不大信任的心情點了最便宜的午間套餐260，跟老公心想：如果一家店好吃，最便宜簡單的就會好吃了，一上菜老公說：這是吉野家嗎？但吃了以後，完全順口顛覆了我的預設立場，單價是有點高，但口味品質是不錯的，下次願意再試試其他品項。,"Seeing that the architecture went in, he found that the chef's inner field was the cheapest lunch set meal 260 with a bad mood of young people.

"【烤牛肉丼的翹楚】
招牌烤牛丼（加肉）

牛烤牛鮭魚卵丼
牛肉跟鮭魚卵的組合 一次享受海陸兩種滋味
味道非常地搭 配上生啤很享受

但吃到最後有點膩 對於口味比較重的我來說
丼飯相對是調味比較輕爽 也許是希望我們吃到更多食材本身的美味才會這樣吧

高麗菜絲跟醃菜可以幫助解膩

店家在服務品質上非常好

招牌的牛肉飯滋味真的很讚!搭配酸奶油一起吃味道非常濃鬱，搭配著飯真的是一口接一口。牛肉的品質非常棒，還可以看到廚師們現場製作。整體裝潢讓人可以放鬆的餐酒館風格。價格略高了一些是可惜之處。另外，牛肉丼的滋味很濃厚，包含蛋黃，酸奶油，醬汁等等，後面會比較膩，點一杯紅酒搭配是蠻不錯的，但是消費上就會更高一些了。,"The taste of the beef rice in the signboard is really great!

"之前吃過初牛、山幗、滿燒肉丼、開丼這幾家，
對肉質都不甚滿意，服務品質也不優，
但這家Power beef不一樣，
這邊遇到的都是天使店員，
入座後主動詢問介紹菜單，
過了五分鐘後就有另一位來點菜，
出來混久了，怕鹹到腎跟吃到香菜，
我一定會先問店員裡面加了什麼，
男神店員都能很清楚的回答我，
「請問，這碗裡面有加什麼燒肉醬嗎？」
「有喔，蘋果燒肉醬」
「會鹹嗎？」
「嗯，算鹹的。」
「那請問我醬汁可以另外放嗎？」
「當然可以啊！(燦笑)」
好佛，通常特殊的點餐需求就比較容易被拒絕，
畢竟店家也必須維護自己的餐點品質，
但這邊可以幫我另外放我真的覺得超讚👍
沾醬另外放的優點就是我可以品嚐原味的牛肉了，開心，而且有好多種吃法。
我們兩點的都是翼板牛 Prime等級，
我的玫瑰色肉片是原塊低溫爐烤牛排，
搭配松露優格真的多了一股濃鬱的香氣，
終於不用再吃詭異的優格醬了😭😭😭😭
這碗的肉片吃起來又嫩又甜，
完全沒有之前在其他家消費的乾柴口感，
我非常喜歡，加上沒有淋上重口味的醬汁，
整碗吃起來完全沒負擔，
拌上大武山的履歷蛋更是順滑，給他第一名。
藜麥飯煮的不錯，粒粒分明，飯量也夠，
燒肉醬我有另外沾著肉片吃，
可惜醬油味稍重也真的偏鹹，
如果淋進去可能分數就沒那麼高了。

豬隊友的就是煎烤過的翅板牛排，
煎得熟度恰到好處，
搭配鹽蔥末多了新鮮洋蔥的甜度，
跟著鮮嫩多汁的牛排與藜麥飯一起入口，
鹹度其實算適中，頗下飯，很討喜，
屬於男生會喜歡的調味。

吃完碗底還會有祝福的話送給你，
雖然份量不大，但整體消費卻很有滿足感，
雖然說價位比起一般蓋飯是高了一些，
但是它的料理絕對值得這個價錢，
不論是肉類選擇、配菜佐料、服務態度都很講究。

你以為他們都沒缺點了嗎？
沒有，今天的味噌湯雖然用料紮實但是溫度不夠，加上裡面又煮了蜆仔味道有點明顯，
然後配菜的醃蘋果不脆不香也不冰，
我不太懂欣賞，但是還是瑕不掩瑜∼

下一家要試試永春站的GYUU NIKU ステーキ專賣店🤗","I have eaten nats, mountains, full roasted meat, and drove.
Not very satisfactory to the meat, and the service quality is not good.
But this Power Beef is different,
All the angel clerks met here,
Ask the introduction menu after the seat,
After five minutes, there will be another food,
I have been mixed up for a long
I will ask what the clerk is added first,
The male god clerk can answer me very clearly,
""Excuse me, what kind of roasted meat sauce is added in this bowl?""
""Yes, apple roast meat sauce""
""Will it be salty?""
""Well, it's salty.""
""Then can I put my sauce separately?""
""Of course! (Chan Xiao)""
Good Buddha, usually special ordering requirements are easier to be rejected.
After all, the store must also maintain its own meals,
But here can help me let me put it on another way, I really feel so happy
The advantage of dipping sauce is that I can taste the original beef, happy, and there are many ways to eat.
Both of us are the prime level of wing board cattle,
My rose meat slices are roasted steaks at the original low -temperature furnace,
With truffle yogurt, there is really a strong aroma,
Finally, no need to eat weird yogurt sauce 😭😭😭😭
This bowl of meat is tender and sweet,
There is no dry firewood that consumed in other homes at all,
I like it very much, plus the sauce that is not drizzled with heavy taste,
The whole bowl has no burden at all,
The resume egg mixed with Dawu Mountain is even more smooth, giving him first.
Quinoa rice is cooked well, the grains are clear, and the amount of rice is enough.
I have a piece of meat in the roast meat sauce.
Unfortunately, the flavor of soy sauce is slightly salty,
If you get in, the score may not be so high.

Pig teammates are fried and grilled winged board steaks,
The cookedness is just right,
With the salt onion, the sweetness of fresh onion,
Follow the fresh and juicy steaks with quinoa rice,
The saltiness is actually moderate.
It belongs to the seasoning that boys will like.

If you have blessings after eating the bottom of the bowl, give it to you,
Although the portion is not large, the overall consumption is very satisfied.
Although it is said that the price is higher than the general rice rice,
But its dishes are definitely worth this price,
Whether it is meat selection, side dishes, or service attitude.

Do you think they have no disadvantages?
No, although today’s miso soup is solid, the temperature is not enough, and the taste of Taipa is a bit obvious.
Then the pickled apples of the side dishes are not crispy or fragrant, not ice,
I don’t know how to appreciate it, but I still don’t hide the Yu ∼

"單手最糟糕的經歷 - 從開始到結束。食物實際上很好，飲料也很好，但客戶服務實際上很有禮貌 - 但結果卻令人難以置信的糟糕。一切都變得如此糟糕。

1.他們的海膽用完了：顯然他們打了3通電話給我：但我沒有收到──所以他們在說謊，或是我的手機壞了，或是他們的手機壞了。這是雙重否定
2.他們同意給TWD300折扣-然後他們忘了在帳單上計算這個折扣。我必須自己做加法和減法（顯然他們此時很緊張）
3. 他們一直追著我付帳（金額也錯了哈哈）

說真的——他們對協議的遵守很好。他們的危機管理令人震驚。如果我不檢查我的手機或同伴的手機，我不會知道發生了什麼。如果我最後沒有檢查我的帳單，我不會知道他們的道歉是否真誠。然後我就被催促去付帳……這簡直是火上加油。

他們很有禮貌，但其行為或背後的主謀卻令人震驚。我非常期待這家餐廳——我甚至取消了另一家餐廳來這裡……非常不高興、飢餓和失望的顧客。","The worst experience of one -handed -from beginning to end.The food is actually very good and the drink is also very good, but the customer service is actually very polite -but the result is incredible.Everything becomes so bad.

1. Their sea urchin was used up: Obviously they made 3 calls to me: but I didn't receive it -so they were lying, or my mobile phone was broken, or their mobile phone was broken.This is a double negation
2. They agreed to give TWD300 discounts-then they forgot to calculate this discount on the bill.I have to do plus and subtraction by myself (obviously they are very nervous at this time)
3. They have been chasing me to pay (the amount is wrong, haha)

Seriously -they have a good compliance with the agreement.Their crisis management is shocking.If I don't check my mobile phone or companion's mobile phone, I won't know what happened.If I did not check my bill in the end, I would not know if their apology was sincere.Then I was urged to pay the account ... This is simply refueling on the fire.

They are polite, but their behavior or the mastermind behind them is shocking.I am looking forward to this restaurant -what I have canceled another restaurant here ... I am very unhappy, hungry and disappointed.",False
"烤牛肉碗很好吃。
然而，過了一段時間，味道就變得乏味了。我吃了很多肉！我沒有這樣的感覺。
另外，價格也高！ ！而且還收取服務費，讓我更不滿意。
吃一次就可以了嗎？","The grilled beef bowl is delicious.
However, after a while, the taste became boring.I ate a lot of meat!I don't have this feeling.
In addition, the price is also high!IntersectionAnd also charged the service fee, which made me even more dissatisfied.
Can you just eat it once?",False

"我點的是招牌烤牛肉丼
端上來是你就能看到精緻的擺盤
滿滿的牛肉以螺旋狀的方式堆疊成圓錐
上頭附上一顆濃鬱的生蛋
邊緣佐以酸奶
牛肉大概Medium-Rare~Medium的熟度
應該是我在台北吃過最好吃的牛肉丼
味噌湯裡加了滿滿的蜆
味道偏重我覺得不錯
蠻令我意外的
以為只是普通味噌
應該一開始就先喝
雖然店家主打的是紅酒
我還是不爭氣的只點了普通啤酒
這裡的啤酒採用的是少見的grandkirin
啤酒花很甜要做好心理準備
下酒菜配的是鴨胸(蠻特別的)
壓胸可能不如你在烤鴨專賣店吃到的那些
但和風的醬汁配上微脆的外皮
你還是能在小小的鴨胸吃層次感
可能是剛開不久的原因吧
店裡的人還沒有很多
是少數美味與客人不成比里的店家
希望店裡生意變好能開久一點囉
服務也很到位
隨便問了店裡養的魚他也能跟你聊聊
牛肉丼必點，不開玩笑","I ordered the signature grilled beef 我
You can see the exquisite set on the end
Full beef stacked into a cone in a spiral -like manner
A strong egg on it is attached to
Edge
The cookedness of the beef is about Medium-Rare ~ Medium's maturity
It should be the best beef I have ever eaten in Taipei.
The miso soup is full of
I think it is good
It's pretty surprising to me
I thought it was just ordinary miso
Drink first from the beginning
Although the shopkeeper hits red wine
I still just ordered ordinary beer
The beer here uses a rare Grandkirin
Beer flower is very sweet to prepare for psychological preparation
The wine is equipped with duck breasts (pretty special)
Pressing the chest may not be as good as you eat in the roast duck specialty store
But the wind sauce with slightly crispy skin
You can still eat layering in the little duck breast
It may be the reason why it is just recently opened, right?
There are not many people in the store yet
It is a few stores that are not more delicious and guests.
I hope the business in the store will be better for a long time
The service is also in place
I just asked the fish in the store and could talk to you
