"偶然發現的花博園區酒吧，原本是要去另一間Triangle，但踏入之後發現這邊別有洞天，一群酒吧餐酒館，室內戶外都有，各異其趣。

外籍人士超多，各色人種，白人黑人南亞人穆斯林，應有盡有。

我們去的是 23 Music Room , 這邊很文青 , so hippie or hipster 🌵👍🌵👍
現場有DJ放歌，客人都很愉快，跳舞聽歌或聊天。

三個年輕店員：Caleb 美國德州小帥哥、Winnie 外文系學生、小雲美人兒，超客氣超友善。自製精釀生啤酒也超新鮮。大家好愉快。這邊實在是好地方，好chill, 好有出國的感覺🌵🌵

我問調酒師「有台灣當地的精釀啤酒嗎」。她說「是的，我們的啤酒」。我說「哪個啤酒廠」？她說“我們的啤酒廠，我們自己釀造啤酒，今年是我們成立10週年”

"我在馬吉廣場時最常去的地方是 23。

台北有兩家分店，一間在圓山，另一間在科技大廈附近。這兩個地方都提供高品質的台灣精釀啤酒。

不過，圓山的23音樂室對我來說更有趣，因為他們經常有DJ，根據夜晚和活動播放不同類型的音樂。因此，如果您想享受樂趣或隨著音樂移動身體。就是這個地方！

那裡的工作人員也很友好，英語說得很好，可以推薦各種啤酒。

他們沒有太多食物，只有披薩和薯條。所以，如果你餓了，最好先去外面吃，但他們的披薩很便宜而且還不錯。

我喜歡這個地方！ 🍻","The most common place I went to Maggie Square was 23.

There are two branches in Taipei, one is in Yuanshan and the other is near the Science and Technology Building.Both places provide high -quality Taiwanese craft beer.

The staff there are also very friendly, English is very good, and you can recommend all kinds of beer.

"不尊重任何表演者，老闆也沒有接受過語言方面的教育，因此他對使用歧視性詞語沒有任何感覺，例如日語中的“JAP”。
如果你是黑膠唱片 DJ，你必須小心他的報價，尤其是如果你來自海外。首先，這裡的轉盤完全不行，這裡的工作人員對音響也不懂，但是他們包括業主都認為還可以。在打 DJ 之前，我試圖確保他們的音頻一切正常，但我發現地線壞了，我問工作人員這些轉盤是怎麼回事，但他只回答我「我不知道」。我也問過店主，他只說不會有音頻。就這樣。不過這對我來說是非常難以置信的，他認為在這麼糟糕的條件下請黑膠唱片 DJ 在那裡演奏也沒什麼問題。正如我所猜測的，由於接地線破損，打 DJ 時一直有很多噪音。另外，他們所有的 DJ 設備都沾滿了灰塵，所以無論您是黑膠唱片 DJ 還是 CDJ，都很難指望這裡有好的聲音。
更重要的是，如果你不是那麼有名的 DJ，也不太謙虛地要求付款，那麼店主就會認為他不需要為你付錢。他仍然只是說我收到他的報價時沒有問他付款，他認為這個邏輯很好，如果表演者在演出前沒有問他，那麼商店也不需要付款。我們從來沒有談論過報酬，當然他也從來沒有和他談論過這個問題，儘管我仍然認為他們需要為所有表演者支付一些費用，除非表演者說不付款也可以（好吧，我確信我已經這次從來沒有這麼說過）。即使是小額的付款也沒關係，因為這表明了他們對演出的感受，而且我不會為此向他們索取非常昂貴的價格。我知道我不是世界上著名的 DJ，所以我知道我該如何表現。所以我不能接受的是他的行為和想法對所有藝術家的不尊重，這只會讓我非常失望。最後，他仍然說他不明白自己的問題是什麼。至少，你得醒來看看你在你的FB上叫我為「JAP」做廣告。希望他能努力學習更多，即使只是關於語言。
這裡根本不推薦未來所有的表演者。如果你認為他們給了你經驗，那完全是謊言。他們只利用你。他們給你作為成長中的職業 DJ 的經驗，所以他們需要給你報酬，即使是很少的，因為你獲得了作為「專業表演者」的經驗。
感謝您閱讀冗長無聊的評論，希望這對您有所幫助並保護 DJ 的驕傲。","Without respect for any performers, the boss has not received language education, so he has no feeling for using discriminatory words, such as ""JAP"" in Japanese.
If you are a vinyl record DJ, you must be careful of his offer, especially if you are from overseas.First of all, the turntable here is completely unsuccessful, and the staff here do not understand the sound, but they believe that the owners think it is OK.Before playing DJ, I tried to ensure that everything was normal for their audio, but I found that the ground line was broken. I asked the staff what was going on, but he only answered me ""I don't know.""I also asked the owner, he only said that there would be no audio.that's all.However, this is very incredible for me. He believes that it is no problem to ask the vinyl record DJ to play there under such bad conditions.As I guess, due to the damage to the ground wire, there have been many noise when playing DJ.In addition, all their DJ devices are covered with dust, so whether you are vinyl record DJ or CDJ, it is difficult to expect a good voice here.
More importantly, if you are not so famous DJs and do not ask for payment modestly, then the owner will think he does not need to pay for you.He still just said that when I received his quotation, he didn't ask him to pay. He thought the logic was good. If the performer did not ask him before the performance, the store did not need to pay.We have never talked about compensation, and of course he has never talked about this problem with him, although I still think that they need to pay some performers, unless the performer says that it is not paid (well, I am sure I am already here I have never said that).Even small payments are okay, because it shows their feelings about the performance, and I will not ask them for a very expensive price for this.I know I am not the famous DJ in the world, so I know how I should perform.So what I can't accept is that his behavior and ideas are disrespectful to all artists, which will only disappoint me.In the end, he still said he didn't understand what his problem was.At least, you have to wake up and take a look at you call me ""JAP"" on your FB.I hope he can work hard to learn more, even if it is only about language.
It is not recommended here all the performers in the future.If you think they have given you experience, it is a lie.They only use you.They give you the experience of DJs in growth, so they need to pay you, even if they are very small, because you have gained an experience as a ""professional performer"".

他們店裡的轉盤壞了。而這家音樂酒吧的工作人員甚至沒有任何音響系統知識。否則，如果你不要求，DJ 就不會付錢，他們認為這種態度沒有問題。此外，他們在 Facebook 廣告上稱日本人為“Jap”，這對一個國家來說是非常粗魯的行為。,"The turntable in their shop was broken.The staff of this music bar does not even have any audio system knowledge.Otherwise, if you do not ask, DJ will not pay, and they think that this attitude is no problem.In addition, they call the Japanese ""JAP"" in Facebook ads, which is very rude for a country.",0.022,0.095,0.883,-0.6366
