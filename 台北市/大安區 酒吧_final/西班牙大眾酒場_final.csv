總結來說，較適合以「喝酒＞吃飯」為主的餐酒館。食物份量偏小(大概單人份)，口味偏台式，想吃飽的話可能會有所失望。不過酒單很豐富，當天喝了4款都很喜歡，價位以東區來說也算是相對高cp值。用餐時段幾乎客滿，建議事先電話訂位。

＊沒有提供水，需額外付費。

【西班牙烘蛋】
跟想像中有些出入，原本以為裡頭會有馬鈴薯，結果沒有🥲 偏台式口味。

【蒂凡牛奶】
點的4杯當中最特別的一款，可以喝到淡淡茶味。點完才發現它也可以做成熱的，私心覺得熱的應該會比較好喝。

【西班牙水果白酒】
算是偏甜的Sangria，白酒味不明顯。人多的話可以直接點一壺比較划算。

炸到外表油亮的糯米椒搭配酸奶醬 是十分開胃的一道前菜
糯米椒品質不錯 大根的很長也新鮮

黑醋栗蘇打 100元

番茄燉牛肚 牛肉 260元

燉牛肚味道中規中矩 普通的番茄味 有加鷹嘴豆 所以也不會太單調 沾麵包覺得不錯吃
不過比起以前吃過中山站的義大利燉牛肚包 可能因為少了稍辣的蒜味青醬搭配 味道上少了驚艷

原味麵包(6片) 60元
燉牛肚的麵包不夠沾 故加點
6片有點小貴 就是普通的烤麵包片 也可以搭配其他菜式一起吃

地中海燉炒蔬菜 160元
其實一直在焗烤菠菜、朝蘚薊乳酪沾醬搖擺不定 不知選哪道好(朝蘚薊好少見  而且不錯吃) 不過看到RATATOUILLE 印象中是料理鼠王的燉菜又還是選擇了燉菜

果然沒讓我失望 超級甜到爆炸的好喝  不過切記不要因為好喝就喝太快
雖甜但酒精濃度還是有的

西班牙吉拿棒 160元
沒有吃到甜點總感覺少了些什麼 就點了
店內只有布朗尼與吉拿棒兩種甜點 感覺布朗尼太普通且甜膩所以選吉拿棒
剛炸好的吉拿棒熱呼呼 口感居然是外酥內軟 裡面的口感是稍微偏馬拉糕的口湳 還帶點濕潤
外面灑肉桂糖 並以迷迭香相襯 讓人欲罷不能

Number of meals: 4 people
(Wen Chang cautiously entered)

The reason is that relatives often help in the store on holidays
I want to say that I went to the tavern to have a drink for a drink to eat Spanish cuisine.
The boss of papipapi heard that it is Hokkaido, so the form of wine field is a combination of Japanese and Western style. I heard that in Japan in recent years, it is very popular in Japan

At 18:00, we have not many people at six o'clock to the beginning, but the seats are actually pre -pre -pre -pre -pre -pre -presented.
At about 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock, the whole room is full

I feel that the amount of each dish is not much suitable for everyone to share
It is recommended that you first order the signature Spanish seafood stew (because it takes about 20 minutes to get on the meal)
It is recommended that drinks can drink while eating

Introduction of the following dishes:

Traditional fried green pepper 90 yuan
The glutinous rice pepper that is fried to the outside is a very appetizing before dish
The quality of glutinous rice pepper is good and the root is very long and fresh and fresh

Black vinegar chestnut soda 100 yuan
Drinks before meals
Recommended by relatives, the alcohol is very light. It is almost about the feeling of galloped water.
There are many XDDDs in ice cubes

Tulu Super Baked Egg 195 yuan
Generally, the upgraded version of the roasting egg is directly used to make the vegetables and the actual thermal insulation effect is good.
There are even more cooked egg truffle sauce white sauce than ordinary eggs
The thick mouth -baking eggs with smooth and tender half -cooked eggs plus wild truffle sauce is really a must
Recommended must

Tomato stew beef beef 260 yuan
Attach 2 small pieces of French bread
The taste of stewed beef belly is quite satisfactory, the ordinary tomato tastes with eagle mouth beans, so it will not be too monotonous to dip the bread and feel good.
However, it may be amazing than the Italian stewed buns that have eaten Zhongshan Station because of the less spicy garlic -flavored green sauce with less spicy garlic green sauce.

Original bread (6 pieces) 60 yuan
The bread of the stewed beef belly is not enough
6 pieces are a bit small, but ordinary baked slices can also be eaten with other dishes with other dishes

The Mediterranean stewed vegetables are 160 yuan
In fact, I have been grilled spinach, pilgrimage cheese dipped in sauce, I do n’t know which one is good (Chao Moss is rare and good to eat), but seeing whether it is the stewed king of the rats in the rittouille impression
Tomato is a stewed stew with bell pepper eggplant, cauliflower, cauliflower mushrooms, etc. It is warm and refreshing

Carbon grilled Matsusaka pork row 290 yuan
There is enough fragrant Matsusaka, that is, some of the pork neck meat is crispy and chewy with egg milk sauce.
Unfortunately
Recommended must
But low -temperature cooking spicy pork steak looks good for the next time, I want to try it next time

Spanish seafood stewed rice stewed rice 460 yuan
Finally came to the highlight of a restaurant to come to the Spanish restaurant.
There is no division of signs of sensing about 3 ~ 4 people
There are 4 shrimp clams squid (Basha?) Sweet pepper
The first bite feels that the seafood of the rice is very heavy (well -sufficient) very satisfied
The rice will not be too strong, and it will not be too soft and delicious
But I feel that it is a little less a little bit less.
But the price of 460 is good
Recommended must

Carbon roasted Spanish sausage (4) 150 yuan
Very juicy with mustard sauce is good

Charcoal grilled chicken wings (5 branches) 180 yuan
The juicy chicken wings are baked well, it will not dry the firewood and tender enough to drip oil
It is also very good with egg milk sauce

Rulu French fries 160 yuan
Colorful
The frying looks clean (maybe it may be more breakfast XDD) The oil is clear
The most fried sip that warm up and warm the most suitable dish for wine
It's not wrong to get anything with truffle sauce

Karwa milk wine 150 yuan
Karuwa Coffee Wine+Milk
I always want to know what the milk tastes taste like it will be ordered.
Sure enough, I didn’t let me be disappointed that it was so sweet that the explosion was delicious, but remember not to drink too fast because it was delicious.
Although sweet but alcohol concentration, there are still

Spanish Ji Rente 160 yuan
If you don't eat desserts, you always feel that you have less.
There are only two kinds of desserts in the store two desserts in the store that feels that Brownne is too ordinary and sweet, so I choose the Ji Ren stick.
The freshly fried Ji -stick hot taste is that the taste of the inside and soft inside of the outside is a slightly macula cake.
Sprinkle cinnamon on the outside and lined with rosemary to make people want to stop
Attach the chocolate sauce but because it is already sweet, I don’t like to touch it.
Recommended must

風格很像西班牙小酒館
整體感覺很chill
而且它內部空間蠻大的

裏面還有吧台區，可以讓雙人或單獨前來的客人有個個人的空間

個人覺得這種設定更好
和朋友在裡面拍了很多照片，還在用餐區休息了很久，很棒！

不過餐點價位偏中高階！
畢竟他們是重視裝潢的店家

還有廁所的位置很特別，在一扇展示牆後面，裡面很乾淨

我們點的什麼松露薯條跟香辣薯條之類的很好吃😋
還有波本酒，超級好喝
還看到了有爆米花機，真的很懷念喔，現在還有這種東西

The food is very delicious and the drink is also delicious. There are many recommended alcoholic drinks, super good to take pictures
The style is very similar to the Spanish tavern
Overall feels very chill
And its internal space is quite large

There is also the bar area in it, which allows the two people or the guests who come alone to have individual space

Personally think this setting is better
I took a lot of photos with my friends, and I took a long break in the dining area, great!

But the price of meals is medium and high -level!
After all, they are the shops that value decoration

The position of the toilet is very special. Behind a display wall, it is very clean

What kind of truffle fries we ordered are delicious and delicious 😋
There are also Bobbon wine, super delicious
I also saw a popcorn machine, I really miss it, there are still such things now

And his waiting position has been basically for a long time,
I suggest you call to make an appointment two days ago,
Many people are full, and in the second game, it can be about 21:00, because it is open to 00:30 here, and the time is relatively abundant.

"2017 年更新：截至 2017 年 1 月，他們似乎將所有菜單的價格上漲了驚人的 35-40%。以前燉牛肉等小點心是190台幣，現在是260台幣，有些菜色如青口也減少了，而且不再提供免費麵包。新推出的炸海鮮拼盤380新台幣，就其提供的東西來說非常昂貴，微小的海鮮包裹在三倍大小的麵粉中。

點了10多個菜，總金額超過3500台幣，我們禮貌地問他們是否可以給我們一兩片麵包（他們是和貽貝一起吃的），他們說現在7片100台幣。

我將它評為五星級餐廳，因為它以合理的價格提供接近正宗的西班牙小吃，但隨著價格的上漲和菜餚的減少，它不再是一家物有所值的餐廳，而是價格昂貴，儘管它仍然很美味。

2016 年原文評論：

我是西班牙人，如果您想體驗西班牙小吃吧，我絕對推薦這家餐廳。與 La Mesa、Hestia 或 El Amor 等其他更成熟的酒吧相比，這個酒吧無疑是便宜的，對我們來說，這些酒吧不是西班牙的，不值得高評價。

價格非常合理，食物量很大，而且非常好吃！

廚師是日本人，在西班牙生活了幾年，我相當有信心地說他抓住了我們的精髓和風味。

我的首選是番茄貽貝、燉牛肉（estofado）、烤串、西班牙海鮮飯（海鮮飯）。

你還可以喝桑格利亞汽酒（不是最好的，但還可以接受！）","Update in 2017: As of January 2017, they seemed to increase the price of all menus by 35-40%.In the past, beef stew and other snacks were NT $ 190, and now it is NT $ 260. Some dishes are also reduced, and free bread is no longer provided.The newly launched fried seafood platter 380 NT $ 380 is very expensive for what it provides, and the tiny seafood is wrapped in three times the size of flour.

I ordered more than 10 dishes, with a total amount of more than 3,500 Taiwan dollars. We politely asked them if they could give us one or two pieces of bread (they ate with the mussels). They said that 7 pieces of NT $ 100 are now.

I have rated it as a five -star restaurant because it provides a Spanish snack close to authentic at a reasonable price, but as the price rises and the dishes decrease, it is no longer a restaurant with a worth of money, but the expensive price is expensive Although it is still delicious.

2016 Original comment:

I am a Spanish. If you want to experience Spanish snacks, I definitely recommend this restaurant.Compared with other more mature bars such as La Mesa, hestia, or El AMOR, this bar is undoubtedly cheap. For us, these bars are not Spain and are not worthy of high evaluation.

The price is very reasonable, the amount of food is very large, and it is very delicious!

The chef is Japanese and lived in Spain for a few years. I am quite confident that he has seized our essence and flavor.

My first choice is tomato mussels, ESTOFADO, skewers, and Spanish seafood rice (seafood rice).
