113/08/17因朋友推薦，首次至貴店消費

相較於附近其他相同性質的店家，消費較高。
不過位於48樓層的環境可以直眺101大樓附近夜景，確實是信義區夜生活少見的風格，滿特別的，如果不出意外的話，會是想回訪的店。

我可以理解禁止攜帶食物及液體類入場的規定，所以我也配合貴店將南部朋友帶給我的生日禮物（手作土鳳梨酥，食物）寄放櫃台，並且有拿到一張寄物單（如圖二）。
當日離場時我並未取走寄放物品，
隔日致電貴店表示已經被丟棄了。
我認為貴店在客人寄物時應明確告知「當日未取物，打烊會當垃圾丟棄」，雖然不是什麼貴重物品，但起碼東西是有包裝的，不像什麼吃剩的廚餘吧？何況我有留電話，一通電話都沒做確認直接丟了，所以我是留身體健康的嗎？
貴店有許多機會可以告知，或許結帳時提醒客人是否有寄物、或許散場時電梯門口的人員可以提醒客人是否有寄物？都是可以避免的。
也許站在店家的立場，你東西自己要忘記拿，
關我屁事？

"這就是人生／Ce La Vi Taipei

據說是全台最高餐酒館的Ce La Vi Taipei位於微風南山48樓，要搭高速電梯才能抵達。有些人可能跟我一樣，在上升過程會有耳朵塞住的感覺，然後聲音就變得有點飄忽，像聽一首收訊不好的歌。

造訪當天是個艷陽天，一行人的胃口似乎也跟著特別好，前菜主食到點心樣樣精彩，搭配恰好的服務、舒適的空調和遼闊的景觀，調和出一片心曠神怡的用餐體驗。

「炭烤風味沙嗲串」（一份三串，500元）可依飲食喜好選擇雞／羊／牛肉或是綜合（雞／羊／牛肉），風味濃郁，相當適合搭配酒水。喜歡哈哈彆扭的我極力推薦「酥炸海鮮搭墨西哥辣椒塔塔醬」（700元），海洋鮮甜融合墨西哥辣椒塔塔醬迸發的清爽與熱力，在唇齒間彈跳出讓人意猶未盡的明媚風光。

「烏魚子凱撒沙拉」（460元）用Hennessy V.S.O.P.浸泡過且烘烤後的烏魚子取代傳統的培根碎，不落俗套的清新，有海風吹拂午後漁村的愜意；外脆內嫩的「香酥森巴辣雞翅」（450元）熱情奔放，特製辣醬餘韻明顯，不容小覷。

「奶油野菇蛋黃水桶麵」（550元）的醬汁有濃郁的起司與雞蛋香氣，均勻包覆在寬如腰帶的義大利水桶麵（Paccheri）上，彈牙口感頗具「醬」心。為了平衡起司蛋黃醬而淋上的花椒辣油，讓樸實穩重的味覺多了些乍洩的靈光，像會議裡冷不防冒出來的笑話，有提振精神的巧妙。醬汁帶點奶油甜、辣椒辛與羅勒香的「香辣龍蝦麵」（1,980元，半隻），整體表現合宜優雅，是安穩的小奢華。

上層是法式烤布蕾下層是台灣紅心芭樂泥的「雙層烤布蕾」（250元）在嘴裡呈現了從焦糖甜到水果酸的味覺動感，以及薄脆、綿密與細膩的質地風味，是我非常喜歡的美味亮點。內餡帶點流心感的「烤泰式奶茶塔」（380元），搭配軟中帶Ｑ的珍珠與香草冰淇淋，是冰與火交織的趣味口感，也是牙齒敏感度的考驗。（誤）

It is said that the CE LA VI TAIPEI of the highest restaurant in Taiwan is located on the 48th floor of Breeze Nanshan. It takes a high -speed elevator to reach.Some people may be like me. In the process of rising, there will be a feeling of stuffing ears, and then the sound becomes a bit erratic, like listening to a song that does not receive a message.

On the day of the visit, it was a sunny day. The appetite of a group seemed to be particularly good. The former cuisine owner had a wonderful snack. With the right service, comfortable air conditioning, and vast landscape, it blended out a happy dining experience.

""Carbon -grilled flavor Sand skewers"" (one -three skewers, 500 yuan) can choose chicken / sheep / beef or comprehensive (chicken / sheep / beef) according to diet preference. The flavor is rich and suitable for wine.I like haha. I strongly recommend ""Crispy Seafood and Mexican Chili Tower Sauce"" (700 yuan). The fresh and sweet ocean sweets and hotness of Mexican chili tower sauce burst out of the lips and teeth.

""Caesar salad"" (460 yuan) uses Hennessy v.s.o.p. soaked and baked murlite to replace the traditional bacon, fresh and fresh, and the sea breeze blows the comfort of the fishing village in the afternoon; ""Senba Spicy Chicken Wings"" (450 yuan) is enthusiastic and unrestrained, and the spicy sauce will be obvious, and it cannot be underestimated.

The sauce of ""creamy wild mushroom egg yolk bucket noodles"" (550 yuan) has a strong cheese and egg aroma, which is evenly covered on the Italian bucket noodles (Paccheri) with a wide belt.The spicy oil drizzled to balance the cheese yolk sauce, which makes the simple and stable taste more likely, like a joke that does not prevent it in the meeting, and has the ingenuity of boosting the spirit.The sauce has a little cream, pepper Xin and ""Spicy Lobster Noodles"" (1,980 yuan, half). The overall performance should be elegant and elegant, and it is a stable little luxury.

The upper layer is the French grilled cloth bud.

48樓的高空餐廳，景觀真的很棒，看101好近好壯觀，看信義區夜景也很棒。哈～唯一不美麗的是晚餐每人低消2000，因為我們沒喝酒，單點吃完份量有點太多，吃到太撐，每人1500點起來應該差不多。但東西真的很好吃~最推薦炸海鮮配塔塔醬，超搭，雞肉串燒也很棒，更迷人的是甜點，熔岩巧克力還有杏仁蘋果塔都好吃，很喜歡，可能其他都太好吃了，主餐選的起司蛋黃麵還有蝦仁燉飯反而覺得很好～整體經驗很棒，有機會會再來試試下午茶。推～,"The high -altitude restaurant on the 48th floor, the landscape is really great. It is very spectacular to see 101, and it is also great to see the night view of the Xinyi District.Ha ~ The only thing that is not beautiful is that dinner eliminates 2000 per person, because we do n’t drink, and the amount of food after order is too much.

"先講優點，以高空景觀餐廳來說，服務真的是超乎想像的棒，甚至比米其林摘星的餐廳更好！從電梯出來，入口處的接待人員、到負責點餐、上菜、桌邊服務的人員都非常細心又有耐心，同行的好友有帶寶寶，主動提醒飲料單哪些是無咖啡飲料、天空樹的餐點品項哪些是有含酒精或是會辣，離開時在門口拍了幾張照，走了幾步準備搭電梯時，門口的接待人員說她已經幫我們把電梯按好了，太貼心了吧！

再來講一下餐點部分，天空樹好像總共12還16道點心，看起來很豐富，但沒有讓人覺得好吃的品項，鹹點幾乎都會辣，還是辣到會咳嗽那種😂（我平常吃小辣沒問題）薯條也超硬。

但環境、服務、景觀都是滿分沒話說！所以還是五星因為我覺得很讚，下次還是會到訪，但不會點天空樹了會試試其他餐點～","Let's talk about the advantages first.

疫情關係不能分食所以服務生會幫忙分到各自的盤子上食用，但他都沒按照順序，害我一個完全搞不清楚哪個先吃。只能看看照片回顧。

天空樹點心部分
我覺得英式最棒的就是甜鹹交替
11樣點心，其中七個甜的，四個鹹的。（他似乎多送了一個？）

第一層那是.. 費南雪嗎..不知道😗
開胃用的，另一個失憶。
第二層鹹點
章魚燒冷冷的🙃怎麼會好吃，蛤？！
那個塔好像在吃台灣小吃在蛋塔裡面，小小蛋捲包鮭魚，這兩個蠻有特色。海帶似乎沒調味😌只有海帶味，還好有鮭魚子。不然跟我偷吃我阿嬤冰箱的海帶無區別的味道。
第三層甜點
馬卡龍😭服務生把我的馬卡龍弄裂開了，我的是藍莓口味的，但是裡面不知道什麼醬感覺很不搭。
粉色底座的是玫瑰地瓜塔，超濃郁的地瓜味😌但我真的不想來這邊吃地瓜。
巧克力磚我以為是類似布朗尼的結果比較偏向厚餅乾
巧克力球日曬的關係🤣直接融化，但榛果香味十足。

茶品我是點茉莉花茶😍花茶香味超剛好很回甘，喜歡甜的人可以跟服務生要，自己按喜好添加。但真的建議前半段配鹹點可以甜一點，後半段甜品可以不配糖，超好吃😘

太陽照的關係影響我吃很快，吃完我就跟朋友躲到室內聊天喝茶了🙃說真的吃完之後，真的覺得他甜點沒什麼記憶點🙃我滿嘴地瓜味，這個千萬要最後吃避免破壞其他點心口感，或著靠茶刷新味蕾。

不過我應該有空還是會來，可能換成看山景那面😂，因為每一段時間都會換點心菜單不用怕沒新鮮感🥰喜歡英式下午茶的一定要去試看看。

😌冰塊上面也有CÉ LA VI 意思是 這就是生活💋","The afternoon tea with super good scenery is in the afternoon time (Afghan afternoon tea).

Sky tree snack part
I think the best British style is sweet and salty alternation
11 snacks, seven of them, four salty ones.(He seems to have given one more?)

The first floor is .. Fei Nanxue ... I don’t know 😗
For appetizers, another amnesia.
The second layer of salty point
How can the octopus burn cold? Clam?Intersection
That tower seems to be eating Taiwanese snacks in the egg tower, and the small egg rolls are packed with salmon. These two are quite distinctive.The kelp does not seem to be seasoning 有 There is only the flavor of the kelp. Fortunately, there is salmon.Otherwise, there is no different taste of the kelp in the refrigerator of my Grandma's refrigerator.
The third layer of dessert
The waiter of Macaron cracked my macaron. Mine was blueberry, but I don't know what sauce feels very incompatible.
The pink base is the rose sweet potato tower, which is super strong sweet potato flavor but I really don't want to come here to eat sweet potatoes.
Chocolate bricks I think it is similar to Brownney's result.
The relationship between chocolate balls is directly melted, but hazelnut fragrance is full.

I am a tea product. I have a jasmine tea 😍 😍 can be asked to the waiters and add it by myself.But it is really recommended that the first half of the section can be sweet. The dessert in the second half can not be equipped with sugar, super delicious 😘

The relationship between the sun photos is very fast. After eating, I hid with my friends to chat and drink tea. After eating tea, I really feel that his dessert has no memory. I have a sweet potato flavor. Eat to avoid destroying other snacks, or refresh the taste buds by tea.

However, I should still come when I have time. I might change it to the side of the mountain view, because I will change the plain menu every time. Don't be afraid that there is no freshness. If you like British afternoon tea, you must try it.

"這次來享用雙人下午茶套餐，價格與 W Taipei 的 Yen Bar 比較起來並不會太貴，且還要稍微便宜一點，在餐食及氛圍上與 Yen Bar 做比較，各有優劣。

對於 CÉ LA VI 的第一印象是戶外用餐區令人驚艷！因為座位的設計是下凹式，因此每一桌就像一個個獨立的套房一樣，很適合一群朋友來這邊享受及度過歡愉的下午及夜晚，又不會被其他組客人打擾到，且即使在寒流來襲時也別擔心，因為每桌都有獨立暖氣，在戶外也不會被冷到，相當不錯且貼心的設計。

[風景] 可眺望台北市景，但視線較多阻礙
CÉ LA VI 及 Yen Bar 兩者都可以看到台北 101 豎立在眼前，不過在戶外區有太多大型陽傘張開，且有滿多大樓本身玻璃帷幕間的樑柱，因此犧牲掉很多觀景視線，如果想要跟 101 合照，會比較困難一點，因此在這點上我比較喜歡 Yen Bar 多一點。

[餐點] 飲品表現不俗，點心具有在地特色
以飲品來說，因為 Yen Bar 是直接走調酒路線，不喜歡喝酒的就沒得選擇，不過 CÉ LA VI 的下午茶就有調酒/茶類/無酒精/無咖啡因可選擇，相較之下選擇多元。而在點心的部分，CÉ LA VI 富有台灣在地與原民風格，這是在其他下午茶餐廳無法體驗到的，且口味也不錯，但如果要說會不會讓人驚艷到，其實也還好。或許 Yen Bar 有 W Taipei 的強大後場廚師群加持，因此明顯料理的口味層次都比 CÉ LA VI 好上更多。

[氛圍] 越夜越精彩
來 CÉ LA VI 一定要等到夜晚來臨，入夜、氛圍燈亮起後又是另外一個世界，與白天的感受截然不同，在夜晚、酒精、音樂及人群的推波助瀾下，是一個嶄新的開始，適合年少輕狂的朋友來此處享受屬於朋友間的快樂！","This time, I will enjoy the two -person afternoon tea set. The price is not too expensive to compare with the Yen Bar of W TAIPEI, and it is a little cheaper. In the meal and atmosphere, compared to Yen Bar, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

The first impression of Cé LA VI is that the outdoor dining area is amazing!Because the design of the seat is a concave type, each table is like an independent suite. It is very suitable for a group of friends to come here to enjoy and spend joy in the afternoon and night, but it will not be disturbed by other groups. And don't worry even when the cold current strikes, because each table has independent heating, and it will not be cold outdoors. It is quite good and intimate.

[Scenery] Overlooking the scene of Taipei, but more vision hinders
Both Cé La Vi and Yen Bar can see Taipei 101 standing in front of them, but there are too many large -scale parasols in the outdoor area, and there are many buildings in the glass curtain of the glass. Therefore, many viewing views are sacrificed If you want to take a photo with 101, it will be more difficult, so I prefer yen bar more in this point.

[Meals] The drinking performance is good, and the dim sum has local characteristics
In terms of drinks, because Yen Bar is a direct bartender route, there is no choice if you don't like to drink, but afternoon tea in Cé La Vi has a bartending/tea/non -alcohol/non -caffeine. Choose diverse.In the dim sum section, Cé La Vi is rich in Taiwan and the aboriginal style. This is unable to experience it in other afternoon tea restaurants, and the taste is good, but if you want to say, it will be amazing. good.Perhaps Yen Bar has the blessing of the powerful backcourt chefs of W TAIPEI, so the taste level of the obvious dishes is better than the Cé LA VI.

[Atmosphere] The more night, the more wonderful
When you come to Cé LA VI, you must wait until the night is coming. After the night and the atmosphere light, it is another world. It is completely different from the experience of the day.

During this period, it is worth mentioning that the service staff (Ahao) is very enthusiastic. The explanation for us, and the reception at the door is simply a lot.

The second meal was 2 days before. Take the boss to experience it. When I stepped into the restaurant, the reception staff changed the other. It was still not OK. After confirming that the reservation was named, it was on there.
Still insisting on the 18:09, but this time it was 9 minutes later. Is this the characteristic of the restaurant?Or lack of employee education?

The reception at the door should be kind, right?

The price of CE LA VI, the service is reversed. During the meal, only Ahao was recommended by my boss. He also said that when you open a restaurant in the future, you will want to dig a corner candidate.

But this time the Tomahawk pork chop is soft and tender, it is worth trying ~

開幕以來第二次拜訪

看到雙人套餐1980，頗為期待，加上一堆網美說有多好吃...

朋友愛吃甜點，Ce La Vi又有全台北最美的風景，在吃過Ukai後，就來吃吃下午茶 (突然想到，這好像是一整個餵食秀...)

一進包廂，101盡收眼底，真是令人興奮的View啊，真的是 ""景觀餐廳""！

不一會，雙人套餐- ""天空之樹""上來了，之前Ukai有提醒我們要怎麼拍才會好看。要結合食物及窗外的景觀拍照。(但Ce La Vi不會提醒要怎麼拍)

問題來了，我們要拍照時，結合食物及101竟發現逆光。

傻眼！

希望各位懂得我努力拍出好照片的心意(雖然構圖還不如朋友)

說到食物，

唉，慘！慘！慘！

尤其是才剛吃過Ukai，落差太大！

我真的不知道為何食物調味，可以調得這麼特別，特別到我覺得

不好吃！

以一個長方型甜點為例(這已經是裡面最好吃的點心)，下方是巧克力餅乾，上方薄薄一層焦糖，內裝布丁，咬下去，等等，這是什麼味道？

香香的，但是跟其他味道不搭

結果是濃郁的黑芝麻

巧克力餅乾+布丁+焦糖+(黑芝麻？)

巧克力餅乾沒吃出巧克力濃香的味道，

布丁？...

焦糖？...

加上黑芝麻？！

嗯，我只能說我的慧根不夠，不懂師傅的智慧

我的慧根只體會這真的是 ""景觀"" 餐廳，餐廳不重要，重要的是景觀啊！

所以我還是維持一年多前的看法，請千萬吃飽喝足再去Ce La Vi，不要對他們的餐點有任何期待，期望有多高，失望就有多大

更不要去了 Ukai 就馬上上樓去Ce La Vi，落差太大，會加深負面印象！

2019/5/3初訪

若是要來吃飯，嗯，建議先在別的地方吃點東西再來

我是一個喜歡吃到原來食物味道的人，不見得要原味，但是喜歡原來的味道。

然而在這，我很難吃到原來的味道

此外，每道菜份量都很少，除非是小鳥胃，否則...

不過夜間景觀超美，是把妹超讚的地方。

我年紀大了，不適合我了

五星：再怎麼貴也值得專程去吃
四星：值得吃，但CP值不見得高
三星：若是在附近可以去吃吃看
二星：除非主廚調整食譜或做法，否則不值得去冒險
一星：嗯，有事沒事都不要去吃

我的評等是我個人依據上述標準提出的主觀意見，若店家不同意可以提出看法","2020/11/12

The second visit since the opening

Seeing the double package 1980, I look forward to it, plus a bunch of net beauty how delicious it is ...

Friends love to eat desserts, CE LA VI has the most beautiful scenery in Taipei. After eating Ukai, come to eat afternoon tea (suddenly thought, this seems to be a whole feed show ...)

As soon as I entered the box, 101 was viewed, it was really exciting View, it was really ""landscape restaurant""!

After a while, the two-person set- ""Tree of the Sky"" came up. UKAI had reminded us how to shoot to look good before.Take pictures with food and landscapes outside the window.(But CE LA VI will not remind them how to shoot)

When the problem comes, when we have to take pictures, we will find backlight in combination with food and 101.

Dumb!

I hope you know how I want to take good photos (although the composition is not as good as friends)

Speaking of food,

Alas, miserable!miserable!miserable!

Especially I have just eaten UKAI, the difference is too big!

I really don’t know why the food is seasoned. I can adjust it so special, especially so much that I think

Not delicious!

Take a rectangular dessert as an example (this is already the best snack inside), below is chocolate biscuits, a thin layer of caramel, interior pudding, bite, etc. What taste is this?

Xiangxiang, but not with other flavors

Well, I can only say that my wisdom is not enough, I don’t understand the wisdom of the master

My Huigen only realizes that this is really a ""landscape"" restaurant. The restaurant is not important. The important thing is the landscape!

So I still maintain my views more than a year ago. Please eat and drink, and then go to the CE LA VI. Don't expect any expectations for their meals.

Don't go to Ukai and go upstairs to CE LA VI. The difference is too large, which will deepen negative impression!

2019/5/3 First visit

If you want to eat, um, it is recommended to eat something elsewhere before you can come again

I am a person who likes to eat the original food. It may not be original, but I like the original taste.

But here, it is hard to eat the original taste

In addition, the amount of each dish is very small. Unless it is a small bird stomach, ...

However, the night landscape is super beautiful, and it is a place where the girl is super praised.

I'm old, it's not suitable for me anymore

Five -star: No matter how expensive it is, it is worth a special trip to eat
Four stars: worth eating, but the CP value is not necessarily high
Samsung: If you can eat and eat nearby
Two stars: Unless the chef adjusts the recipe or practice, it is not worth adventure
One star: Well, don’t eat if you have anything to do

"貴為全球知名米其林的ce la vi ⋯餐點水平還是有的，但是服務卻不及格。

首先下午茶時段入場，從電梯口出來的接待處空間非常狹窄，所有客人擠在入口幾乎肩並肩的距離，加上熱天真的容易失去耐心，看得出外場訓練不足、人力也不足，領台經驗更是不足，沒有適當的話術來解釋為什麼一堆人擠在門口，得等你唱名才能入坐？而且速度很慢（人力不足的情況下得等帶位回來的外場人員接續帶下一組客人）

入座後更是直擊服務訓練鬆散，新人介紹菜單生疏也是難免，但連來三次帳單實在不符合米其林等級的禮儀。

第一次是過來說未滿低消需要我們再加點，經過重新提醒、確認才來道歉說已經滿低消。

第二次在桌上餐點都還沒食用完的時候就來問要不要先買單？哈囉？沒看到我們還在吃嗎？是在急什麼？被我回絕。

最後一次是在下午茶時段即將結束時過來提醒買單，在客人面前唸出帳單金額實在讓人無語⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯。

First of all, the afternoon tea period enters the venue. The reception space from the elevator mouth is very narrow. All guests are squeezed at the entrance almost side by side. In addition, it is really easy to lose patience. The experience of Taiwan is even more insufficient. If there is no appropriate skill, to explain why a bunch of people are squeezed at the door, they have to wait for you to sing before they can enter?And the speed is very slow (when the manpower is insufficient, you have to wait for the out -of -field personnel who come back to bring the next group of guests)

After the seating, it is even more unavoidable for the newcomer menu to introduce the menu, but even the three bills are not in line with the etiquette of Michelin.

The first time I said that we needed to add some more, and we need to apologize after re -reminding and confirmation that it was already low.

When I did n’t eat it on the table for the second time, I asked if I did n’t finish it.Hello?Didn't you see that we are still eating?What are you in a hurry?I was rejected by me.

"服務令人失望，但 Libby 提供優質的食物和優質的服務

我們最近在台北 CE LA VI 用餐，雖然食物很棒，但由於糟糕的客戶服務和平淡的氛圍，我們的整體體驗並不令人印象深刻。

一位朋友提前四週預約，但由於個人原因，他和女友未能出席。不幸的是，CE LA VI拒絕滿足我們將預訂從四人調整為兩人的要求，並堅持我們仍然至少點四道主菜。儘管我們從美國和馬來西亞遠道而來，但他們只為我們提供了一次重新安排預訂的選項——對於像我們這樣的國際遊客來說，這是一個不切實際的解決方案。更糟的是，如果我們選擇離開，我們還需要支付3,000元新台幣。這讓我們在用餐之前就感到沮喪。

更令人失望的是，那天晚上下著大雨，嚴重影響了我們一直期待的景色。選擇CE LA VI的部分原因是為了欣賞台北101的著名景觀，但由於下雨，透過窗戶幾乎看不到這個標誌性的地標。總的來說，餐廳的氛圍並沒有達到我們預期的高檔標準，尤其是與我們在吉隆坡君悅酒店欣賞雙子星大樓壯麗景色相比。

然而，真正挽救這個夜晚的是食物——每道菜都很美味——以及我們的服務員 Libby 提供的出色服務。她非常細心，風度翩翩，她的正面能量幫助我們在晚上經歷了艱難的開始後振奮了精神。感謝她，儘管一開始有些失望，我們還是能夠帶著微笑離開。

總體而言，雖然食物和 Libby 的優質服務脫穎而出，但 CE LA VI 台北在客戶服務和氛圍方面還有很多不足之處，特別是對於期待難忘的高端體驗的國際遊客而言。","The service is disappointing, but libby provides high -quality food and high -quality services

We have recently dine at CE LA VI in Taipei. Although the food is great, our overall experience is not impressive due to bad customer service and a bland atmosphere.

A friend made an appointment in advance, but because of personal reasons, he and his girlfriend failed to attend.Unfortunately, the CE LA VI refused to meet the requirements for us to adjust the booking from four to the two, and insist that we still order at least four main dishes.Although we come from the United States and Malaysia, they only provide us with a re -arrangement option -for international tourists like us, this is an unrealistic solution.To make matters worse, if we choose to leave, we still need to pay NT $ 3,000.This makes us feel frustrated before dining.

What is even more disappointing is that it rained that night, which seriously affected the scenery we have been expecting.Part of the reason for choosing CE LA VI is to appreciate the famous landscape of Taipei 101, but due to the rain, this iconic landmark can hardly see through the window.In general, the atmosphere of the restaurant does not meet the high -end standards of our expected expectations, especially compared with the magnificent scenery of the Gemini Star Building at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Kuala Lumpur.

However, the food that really saved this night -every dish is delicious -and our waiter Libby provided excellent services.She was very careful and personable. Her positive energy helped us inspiring us after experiencing a difficult start at night.Thank her, despite being disappointed at first, we can still leave with a smile.

更糟的是，第二天，路易斯打電話給我，抱怨沒有及時收拾剩下的花。這是我們的疏忽，但她的咄咄逼人的做法是沒有必要的。我們的活動策劃者是指定的聯絡人，我不確定路易斯是如何獲得我的個人號碼的。

非常尷尬。我很驚訝他們沒有拿出一些麵包，或者後來因為錯誤而扔掉了一份免費甜點。或者對這道菜有一些功勞。沒有什麼。只是品味很差——任何其他競爭對手都會做*某事*。看看其他評論，犯錯然後不採取行動似乎很常見。

順便說一句，飲料選擇方面，除了傳統的杜松子酒馬丁尼之外，*所有*雞尾酒都非常別緻且過於甜膩。就是這樣 - 對於那些不想喝果味糖飲料的人來說，這是唯一的選擇。他們也可以使用更多「男子氣概」的飲料，例如老式威士忌飲料（仍然含有糖，只是幾乎沒有）。或精釀比利時啤酒。

Very embarrassing.I was surprised that they did not take out some bread, or later thrown away a free dessert because of the mistake.Or have some credit for this dish.there is nothing.It's just a bad taste -any other competitors will do*.Look at other comments, it seems common to make mistakes and do not take action.

By the way, in terms of drink selection, except for the traditional Dutongzi wine Martini, all*cocktails are very chic and too sweet.That's it -this is the only choice for those who don't want to drink fruit sugar beverages.They can also use more ""masculinity"" beverages, such as old whiskey drinks (still contain sugar, but almost no).Or craft Belgian beer.

打電話詢問我們是否可以去或預訂，因為我們有客人，並帶著他們整天在台北轉悠，所以我們晚上沒有穿好衣服。他們說沒關係。只要我們不需要預訂餐桌，我們就歡迎您前往，最低限度是在酒吧喝一杯。  進入後，我們再次被告知，如果我們住在酒吧，至少要喝一杯。我們對此表示同意。但我不明白為什麼接待員要從頭到腳打量我的客人（包括我的妻子）。已經打電話詢問我們是否可以不穿著參加聚會。進去後，服務員告訴我們酒吧已經滿了，所以我們需要最少 150 美元訂一張桌子。老實說，如果我們打算真正喝酒的話，並不會很多，但我已經告訴他們這只是回家前喝一杯。不明白為什麼他們提供酒吧座位並告訴我們在沒有座位的情況下繼續。我們決定離開。最壞的情況即將到來。離開時，我們告訴接待員酒吧裡沒有桌子並決定離開。他們一邊怒視著我們，一邊告訴我們這個地方有最低收費，然後咯咯地笑，好像我們只是為了免費參觀一樣。我想他們只是達不到國際夜生活的標準。去過新加坡的 Ce La Vi 和亞洲各地的許多俱樂部酒吧，但沒有得到這種待遇。這是蹩腳的Ce La Vi 台北，很有歧視性。遺憾的是，我是說服我的客人來而不是其他地方的人，因為我以前去過那裡幾次。,"Call us if we can go or book, because we have guests and take them to Taipei all day, so we did not wear dresses at night.They said it was okay.As long as we don't need to book a dining table, we welcome you to go, the minimum is to drink a drink in the bar.After entering, we were told again that if we live in the bar, we have to drink at least one drink.We agree with this.But I don't understand why the receptionist should look at my guests (including my wife) from head to toe.I have called to ask if we can not wear a party without wearing.After entering, the waiter told us that the bar was full, so we needed at least $ 150 to order a table.Honestly, if we plan to really drink, there will not be a lot, but I have told them that this is just a drink before going home.I don't understand why they provide a bar seat and tell us to continue without a seat.We decided to leave.The worst case is coming.When we left, we told the receptionist bar without a table and decided to leave.While glaring at us, they told us that there was a minimum fee in this place, and then giggled, as if we were just visiting for free.I think they just can't meet the standards of international nightlife.CE LA VI, Singapore and many club bars around Asia, but did not get this treatment.This is the CE LA VI Taipei, which is very discriminatory.Unfortunately, I persuaded my guests instead of people elsewhere, because I have been there several times before.",False,0.025,0.026,0.949,-0.3136

"我們真的很欣賞 CE LA VI 台北店一貫的美妙用餐體驗。

從開胃菜到主菜和甜點，一切都令人難以置信。這實際上是我們第八次在這裡用餐。食物從來沒有讓我們失望過。行政主廚皮朋是我們見過的最有才華的廚師之一。

我們經常旅行，去過幾家高級餐廳，例如倫敦的 Dinner by Heston Blumenthal、芝加哥的 Alinea 和台北的 L’ATELIER de Joël Robuchon。 我們從來沒有想過除了 CE LA VI 台北之外我們還必須再去以上任何一家餐廳。這次，廚師的四川燉魚讓我們大吃一驚。魚肉很嫩，入口即化，醬汁層次豐富，鮮味十足。  我們不敢相信廚師根本不喜歡辛辣的食物。不過，他告訴我們，他喜歡去新加坡、香港或馬來西亞嘗試當地美食來創作他的創意菜餚。我們非常欽佩這一點，因為我們絕對可以飛去尋找食物。

至於服務，今天詹姆斯非常細心，經理愛德華過來檢查我們是否滿意，並且非常渴望得到我們的回饋。

每當我們第九次回到台北時，我們一定會再次訪問。","We really appreciate CE LA VI Taipei Store's consistent dining experience.

From appetizing dishes to main dishes and desserts, everything is incredible.This is actually the eighth time we have dining here.Food has never disappointed us.Executive chef Pi Peng is one of the most talented chefs we have ever seen.

We often travel and have been to several high -end restaurants, such as DINNER BY HESTON BLUMENTHAL in London, Alinea in Chicago, and L ’Atelier de Joël Robuchon in Taipei.We have never thought that in addition to CE LA VI Taipei, we must go to any of the above restaurants.This time, the chef's Sichuan stew fish surprised us.The fish is tender, the entrance is melted, the sauce is rich in layers and full of umami.We can't believe that chefs don't like spicy food at all.However, he told us that he likes to try local cuisine to create his creative dishes in Singapore, Hong Kong or Malaysia.We admire this very much, because we can definitely fly to find food.

"一家先進的酒吧位於新開幕的 Breeze Namsan 的 48 樓。
它擁有曼谷典型的時尚氛圍。
然而，它並沒有我想像的那麼寬敞。

也許是因為附近有國外辦事處，常有歐美客戶。

入口有點難找，所以不是從百貨商場入口進去，而是從隔壁辦公室入口進去，搭電梯上去。

雖然叫酒吧，但和信義區的其他酒吧一樣，音樂聲很大，幾乎就像一個俱樂部。
如果你想放鬆一下，安靜地喝一杯，請不要去那裡。

還有靠窗的座位，可以看到台北101的景色。不過可能有最低消費，而且價格昂貴，所以必須一大群人去。

店中間有吧台和高凳子座位，但是周末顧客很多，所以12:00左右去的時候已經滿了，沒座位，所以我有點困惑我應該去哪裡。

所以如果你想坐下來喝一杯，我建議早點去。","A advanced bar is located on the 48th floor of the newly opened Breeze Namsan.
It has a typical fashion atmosphere in Bangkok.
However, it is not as spacious as I imagined.

Perhaps because there are foreign offices nearby, European and American customers are often.

The entrance is a bit difficult to find, so it is not from the entrance to the department store, but from the entrance of the office next door and take the elevator.

Although it is called a bar, like other bars in Xinyi District, the sound of music is almost like a club.
If you want to relax, drink a drink quietly, please don't go there.

There are also seats against the window, you can see the scenery of Taipei 101.However, there may be a minimum consumption and expensive, so a large group of people must go.

There are bar and high stool seats in the middle of the shop, but there are many customers on the weekend, so it is full when I go around 12:00, there is no seat, so I am a little confused where I should go.

雞尾酒？不專業，輕描淡寫。只要去喝啤酒，至少他們不會弄錯並忽略態度問題，這不是個人的。
