"最喜歡的菜是鰻魚玉子燒，廣島燒也不錯，烤肉串滿會烤的，但好像比較不是我的菜。11 月的推薦酒 Far Yeast 東京金啤酒很順口，有花果香。

座位有點擠，空間滿小，但氣氛和服務都不錯。","The favorite dish is the eel jade roast. Hiroshima is also good. The barbecue skewers are baked, but it seems that it is not my dish.In November, the recommended wine Far Yeast Tokyo Golden Beer is very smooth and there are flowers and fruits.

The seat is a bit crowded, the space is full, but the atmosphere and service are good."
"基本上8成以上的餐點都很好吃！最喜歡的是炸牡蠣，新鮮又多汁，如果吃不慣梅子醬可以像我另外跟店員要塔塔醬，炸雞翅也好好吃，推薦可以選少見的名古屋風味，明太子雞肉大阪燒不太喜歡，裡面有事先不知道的紅薑而且不算少數，整體很搶味，如果店員能事先說明會更好，畢竟不喜歡薑的人應該不算少數，生牛肉、稻草鮭魚燒都不錯，額外的香氣很足夠！啤酒我們喝了店員推薦介紹的酒都很符合我們的口味，我點火龍果男友店酸啤酒！

餐點原本可以給五顆星
最後被嚇人的甜點毀掉
「或許是炸麻薯」
原本看照片以為是蕨餅類QQ的東西
沒想到是炸麵包
四種口味我吃到紅趜
軟爛熱熱的口感超噁心…
但男友還可以接受所以吃完了
建議店家對這種不明確的餐點
還是加以說明好…….😰😰😰😰

總之如果避雷的話會很開心
願意再度二訪～～～👍🏻","Basically, more than 80 % of the meals are delicious!The favorite is fried oysters. It is fresh and juicy. If you do n’t get used to plum sauce, you can ask for tower sauce like me. Fried chicken wings are also delicious. It is recommended to choose a rare Nagoya flavor. I like it, there are red ginger that is not known in advance, and there are not a few. The overall taste is very tasteful. If the clerk can explain in advance, it will be better. After all, there should be a small number of people who do not like ginger. The aroma is enough!Beer we drank the wine recommended by the clerk, which is in line with our taste.

Meals can originally give five stars
Finally was destroyed by the scary dessert
""Maybe it is fried hemp potato""
I originally looked at the photos and thought it was a fern cake QQ
I didn't expect it to be fried bread
I have eaten red 味 in four flavors
The soft and hot taste is super disgusting ...
But my boyfriend can accept so I finished eating
It is recommended that the store for this unclear meal
Still explain good .... 说

In short, if you have a lightning protection, you will be very happy
Willing to visit again ~~~ 👍🏻"
"2024.08.29初訪
前一天才訂位所以只剩下吧台位置，吧檯座位是完全沒有間隔的，因為有些店家安排吧檯座位還是會空一個座位，但他們沒有，所以座位偏小！

🔺黃金豬玉大阪燒 $340
送上來的時候，因為前面吃太多炸的，有點反胃就吃不太下，不過味道是好的，鹹甜適中，兩個人分食剛好！

"對於這樣的服務，激推！！
我只能給予五顆星的最高評價！！
這才是我在台北市想要獲得的服務！！

不會給你壓力也沒有給你一點不舒服的感覺
而且都是親切的微笑並且歡迎

那天是生日已經於晚餐時段吃飽然後經過
Abv bar 想說可以進去喝兩杯，剛好身上有帶他們公司行銷活動的明信片換酒

進去就有表明要使用明信片換酒
店員也馬上說ok，並不像很多店面兌換東西都有一大堆奇奇怪怪的規定，他們真的很阿莎力的給換酒！並且內用還是有給座位並且先幫忙把酒倒出酒杯讓我們小酌！

之後的一小時時間內也沒有任何不禮貌的催促是不是該點餐之類的！（當天真的吃很飽）

最後喝完離開時有跟服務人員表達感謝，下次要用餐或是下班喝一杯，我覺對會來的！

覺得店面敢做行銷活動就是要如此阿莎力
才能真正留住客人的心！！

絕對大力推廣👌👌","For such a service, push!Intersection
I can only give the highest evaluation of five stars!Intersection
This is the service I want to get in Taipei!Intersection

I won't give you pressure or give you a little uncomfortable feeling
And they are all kind smiles and welcome

That day was the birthday that was full during dinner and then passed through
ABV Bar wants to say that you can go in and drink for two glasses. There are postcards that bring their company marketing activities to change wine.

Go in, it means that you need to use a postcard to change the wine
The clerk also immediately said that OK, not like many stores exchanged things, there are a lot of strange and strange regulations. They really change wine for Ashari!And there is still a seat for internal use, and first help the wine to pour the wine to let us drink it!

There is no impolite urging in the following hour, whether it should be ordered or not!(I really eat it that day)

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the service staff when I left. I think I will come to the next time or drink a drink after get off work!

I think the store dares to do marketing activities is to be so Ashali

想喝各國啤酒的首選。晃了幾條通沒鍾意的店，特地過來沒失望；雖然辣炒牛肉太生了些，但餐點口味都不錯，憑感覺選的啤酒都很好喝，玩得很愉快！,"I want to drink beer in various countries.After shaking a few shops that were unwilling, they came over and were not disappointed.

販賣多種啤酒的居酒屋，啤酒要自己到冰箱選購，整體風格有點現代美式，但餐點是日式居酒屋的料理，菜色多樣，一般居酒屋串燒、炒、炸物類型都有，口味都蠻有水準，大部分都好吃，上餐速度也還ok，週五用餐時間沒什麼等到。,"Izakaya that sells a variety of beer. Beer must buy it in the refrigerator.

Mar/11, 24' 初訪

一進店門，是光田負責接待。
一開始不怎麼投機，後來經他介紹，喝到了不錯的酒，後面也有小聊起來，是個服務滿分的年輕人，很真心的推薦😂
這邊的酒，裝的冰箱滿滿的，推薦IPA 的酒，很好喝。
第二支酒是由妹妹介紹的triple IPA ，介紹滿分，懂我想要的。

但要不是為了湊低消，點了一盤生牛肉，結果吃的時候，甚至還有剛從冷凍庫出來的冰塊的結晶感，但擺盤上面有柚子跟橄欖，只是牛肉結晶感的味道⋯ 不太滿意

若有機會，仍會為這家的啤酒再二訪。","AUG/28, 24 '

Mar/11, 24 'First visit

As soon as I entered the store door, Ogima was responsible for reception.
At first I was not very speculative. Later, after he introduced it, I drank a good wine, and there was a small chat in the back. It was a young man with a full service.
The wine here, the refrigerator is full, and the IPA wine is recommended, which is very delicious.
The second wine is the Triple IPA introduced by my sister. Introduce the full score and understand what I want.

But if it wasn't for a low disappearance, ordered a plate of raw beef, when eating, there was even the crystallization of the ice cubes that just came out of the frozen library, but there was grapefruit and olives on the plate. Not too satisfied

If you have a chance, you will still visit this beer."

1. Pu roast eel kettle rice: The perfect combination of rich Pu roasted eel and glutinous rice exudes a mouth -watering aroma. It is an endless Japanese classic cuisine.

各種IPA的啤酒有夠棒，酒菜也算可以，但買單可能酒比菜還花更多！唯店長服務冷淡，大概不缺從晶華酒店走過來的生客。,"Various IPA beer is great, and wine and vegetables can be considered, but the purchase may be more wine than vegetables!The shop leader's service is cold, and there is probably no shortage of guests who come from Jinghua Hotel."
"平日晚上到訪，店裡得生意非常好，因為當天才臨時打電話訂位的關係，坐到了吧台座（雖然說是吧台位，不過也還算寬敞）；並且店內也有很多日本客人，看的出來口味上很受歡迎

餐點的部分，我們兩位雖然點的不多（胡麻豆腐沙拉、鮭魚親子釜飯及一份大阪燒），但份量剛剛好！
- 胡麻豆腐沙拉完全就是我期望的口味，清爽但是非常有飽足感，食慾不佳的時候很適合來上一盆
- 鮭魚親子釜飯雖然意外的是鮭魚鬆而不是鮭魚肉，但反而我更喜歡（相比鮭魚肉更喜歡魚鬆）
- 店裡的大阪燒品項非常多，眼花撩亂啦，建議就是看面相選喜歡的，反正都很好吃🤣

當天因為騎車的關係沒有喝酒，惋惜錯過了整片的啤酒牆，必須再回訪！！！

P.s. 店員感覺有挑過，都很帥😆","When I visited on weekdays, the business was very good in the store, because the relationship between the temporary phone call was temporarily called on the day. It's very popular in the taste

For the meal, although the two of us are not too much (the mucus tofu salad, the salmon parent -child kettle rice and a part of the Osaka), the portion is just right!
-Omallium tofu salad is completely the taste I expect, refreshing but very satiety, when the appetite is not good, it is very suitable for a pot.
-Although the salmon parent -child rice rice is unexpectedly salmon pine instead of salmon meat, I prefer it (prefers fish pine more than salmon meat)
-Stheries in the store are very many, and the dazzling is messy. It is recommended that you choose to choose each other. Anyway, it's delicious.

I did n’t drink because I had a bicycle relationship that day. I regret that I missed the whole beer wall and had to return to visit again!IntersectionIntersection

P.S. The clerk feels very handsome, all handsome 😆"
"當天三人點了4-5道菜，三人都覺得餐點少了一種精髓，不夠香不夠鮮或不夠味。

如果口味沒有要求，只是要一個環境好氣氛好可以喝酒的地方，還是可以來這裡。","On the same day, the three of them ordered 4-5 dishes. All three felt that the meal was less essence.

"氣氛不錯，食物味道也都很優秀，酒款選擇超多可以請店員推薦。以下按喜好推薦品項
🌟奶油乳酪弟戎鮮蝦 260
這款是由清脆的小黃瓜、多汁的番茄、彈牙的蝦仁配上濃郁鹹香的cream cheese及嗆辣的芥末子淋醬，歐式料理的作風融合日式調味的靈魂，多層次的清爽爆擊，吃完立刻開胃。

🌟起司明太子玉子燒 320
喜歡濃郁調味的必點這款，淋滿明太子美乃滋的超厚玉子燒柔嫩保水，裡面居然還包了足量的起士和明太子，一口咬下內餡炸開，濃厚鹹香的雙重鮮味真的滿足到不行。

🌟南蠻風炸雞 300
🌟酥炸海苔鮮魷 300
他們家的炸功很優秀，炸物外皮酥脆不油膩，內裡還保有汁水。用糖、醋、蔥和辣椒醃製過的南蠻炸雞是很經典的日式料理，蘸上美式的塔塔醬瞬間有種文化衝擊感。海苔鮮魷除了灑上海苔粉以外，沾醬也是特製的海苔塔塔醬，超級特別！

🌟黃金豬玉燒 340
這款大阪燒上面有一顆黃金蛋和滿滿的翠綠青蔥，外表超吸睛，內層是軟軟糊糊的大阪燒，高麗菜甜脆和紅薑的甜辛除了增加口感也非常清爽，雖然紅薑味道很突出但不會有刺激的辛辣感，搭配上豬肉和起司很解膩，討厭薑味的建議直接跳過。這款建議3-4個人分食不然會膩口。

🌟蔥鹽雞肉串 240
這款雞腿肉走嚼勁紮實的路線，肉感非常強烈，但喜歡軟嫩口感的就不適合。上面的蔥鹽醬很優秀，鹹香重口的味道非常適合配甜甜的水果啤酒。

🌟照燒鐵板雞頸肉 320
這款調味偏甜口，用甜甜的照燒醬大火快炒高麗菜、豆芽菜以及雞頸肉，比較適合愛吃甜鹹交錯的人，我自己不太愛。

🌟日式枺茶紅豆糰子 160
他們家的紅豆泥綿密卻不甜膩，糰子Q彈不黏牙，抹茶粉只是薄撒輔佐，主要是黑糖醬的香氣，有日式的作風卻摒除過甜的缺點，非常完美！

🌟洛神/油柑子啤酒 200
因為店內酒款多到眼花撩亂，建議大家可以找店員推薦，提出自己的喜好店員就會引導找出最適合的選擇。我喝的這兩瓶是很特殊的水果系列，不會過甜也不會苦澀，個人很滿意！","The atmosphere is good, and the taste of food is also excellent. There are many choices of wine. You can ask the clerk to recommend it.The following below is recommended by the preferences
弟 Cream cheese brother Rong Xian Shrimp 260
This is a crispy cucumber, juicy tomato, elastic shrimp with a strong salty cream cheese and spicy mustard seed sauce. Strike, appetizing immediately after eating.

玉 玉 玉 🌟 子 🌟 烧 明 320
If you like the rich seasoning, you must order this. The super thick jade roast is soft and tender, which is covered with the prince Meinizi. It actually includes a sufficient amount of cheese and Prince Ming. It's really satisfied.

3 Nanaka Wind Fried Chicken 300
Crispy fried sea moss fresh squid 300
Their frying skills are excellent, the fried skin is crispy and non -greasy, and there is juice inside.The southern fried chicken marinated with sugar, vinegar, shallots and peppers is a very classic Japanese dish. Diping in American -style tower sauce instantly has a sense of cultural impact.In addition to the sprinkle of Shanghai moss fresh squid, the dipping sauce is also a special seaweed tower sauce, which is super special!

烧 Golden pig jade burning 340
There is a golden egg and full green green onion on this Osaka burning. The appearance is super eye -catching. The inner layer is a soft Osaka roast. The sweet and crispy and red ginger sweetness is also very refreshing. Although red Ginger flavor is prominent but not irritating and spicy. It is very greasy with pork and cheese. It is recommended to jump directly when hate ginger flavor.This suggestion 3-4 people will not be tired of eating.

串 Onion salt chicken skewers 240
This chicken leg meat is chewy and solid, and the meat feels very strong, but it is not suitable for those who like soft and tender taste.The onion and salt sauce above is excellent, and the salty flavor is very suitable for sweet fruit beer.

颈 颈 🌟 🌟 🌟 320
This flavor is sweet and sweet, and fried tauli, bean sprouts, and chicken neck with a sweet lotus sauce. It is more suitable for people who love sweet and salty. I don't love it myself.

🌟 枺 枺 🌟 red bean ball 160
The red beans in their family are dense but not sweet. They do not stick their teeth. Matcha powder is only auxiliary. It is mainly the aroma of brown sugar sauce. It has Japanese style but eliminates the shortcomings of sweetness. It is perfect!

子 子 🌟/oil mandarin beer 200
Because the wine in the store is so dazzling, it is recommended that you can find the clerk to recommend it, and put forward that your preferences will guide the best choice.The two bottles I drink are very special fruit series. They will not be sweet or bitter. I am very satisfied!"
"大阪燒不好吃，明太子起司還不錯
店員態度很差，其他分店的店員都沒這樣

7/31晚班站在端菜區的一男一女店員欠訓練🥲不會想再前往","Osaka is not delicious, Prince Ming cheese is pretty good
The clerk's attitude is very poor, and the clerk in other branches is not like this

7/31 The evening class stands in a male and female shop assistant in the Duancai area."

服務人員雖然看起來很沒精神，但想要推薦啤酒都可以問他們哦！每個都很好喝🍺（但切記先想好要酸或甜、什麼風味的，再跟服務生點餐唷！）","The atmosphere is very good and the food is delicious!IntersectionIntersection
The chef Gery Brother is the reason why we meals for five stars. Sitting on the bar, I react with the chef to the food (Ming Prince Chicken Boamed/Nanaka Fried Chicken/Green Green Strawing)
You can see how the kitchen inside is cooking in the semi -open kitchen. It looks very clean and neat, and it is very secure.

Although the service staff looks very inexperienced, you can ask them if you want to recommend beer!Each is delicious (but remember to think about sour or sweet, what flavor, and then order with the waiter!)"

"中山區這間就在晶華酒店後面巷子裡公園旁邊，蠻好找的。點評一下當天吃的餐點和啤酒們✌️

✅ 特製生牛肉：我跟我弟看到有這種日式生牛肉冷盤就會點🤣 配啤酒很好👌

✅炭燒鹽麴雞：整盤看起來超黑🤣 雞肉是用鹽麴醃過再去炭烤，上面灑了柚子胡椒鹽，雞肉蠻軟嫩的，很特別。

✅酥炸海苔鮮魷：這個超推欸！魷魚本身蠻大又Q，外層酥皮有加海苔粉超香又很脆，整盤很涮嘴！會一直想繼續夾🤣

✅稻草燒刺身：這是用稻草燻燒新鮮刺身，讓生魚片油脂微微流出，吃起來口感更佳，還會帶點清香。

✅ 串燒. 烤魷魚和日式鍋物都蠻好吃🤤 人多比較好點菜，可以多點一些大家一起分享。

✅ 啤酒種類非常多，可以挑的很開心。日本山口酒廠系列有好幾罐是得過獎的，喜歡淡味一點的可選Pilsner, 喜歡濃口一點的可選Stout。比利時啤酒超多，還會搭配不同的杯子，個人私心推薦Corsendonk家的，而且當天居然有他們家每年聖誕節限定的Christmas Ale, 如果你看到這罐，拜托你立刻拿🤣 口感和香氣都很棒👍 其他我們就隨意拿沒喝過的🤣 結果都不錯欸。

推薦給喜歡喝啤酒的人，在這邊會挑酒挑的很開心🥳","The Zhongshan District is next to the park in the lane behind Jinghua Hotel. It is quite easy to find.Comments the meals and beer you ate that day ✌️

我 Special raw beef: I and my brother when I saw this kind of Japanese raw beef cold disk, and I will order beer.

麴 Carbon roasted salted chicken: The whole market looks super dark. Chicken chicken is marinated with salt and then grilled. The grapefruit pepper pepper is sprinkled on it. The chicken is quite soft and special.

Crispy fried sea moss fresh squid: This super push!The squid itself is quite big and Q. The outer plasmis is super fragrant and crispy, and the whole plate is pouting!Will always want to continue to pinch

刺 Burning sashimi: This is a fresh sashimi with straw, so that the sashimi slices of sashimi sashimi slightly out, it tastes better, and it will also have a little fragrance.

Skewers, roasted squid and Japanese -style pots are pretty delicious. People can order more food. You can share more.

There are many types of beer, and you can pick very happy.There are several cans in the Japanese Yamaguchi Winery series that are awarded. I like a little optional Pilsner and a more optional Stout.Belgian beer is so many, and it will be paired with different cups. I personally recommend the CORSEENDONK family, and there is a Christmas Ale, which is limited to Christmas every year that day. If you see this can, please immediately get the taste and aroma of the 🤣 比 immediately. We will take the results that we have never drank well at will.

Recommended to people who like to drink beer, you will pick wine here very happy 🥳"
"連續二星期造訪同系列ABV酒吧，上星期去美式酒吧，這星期來日式酒吧。兩者的風格迥異，相同點就是驚人的酒櫃與啤酒種類。
日式居酒屋的餐點偏鹹，而且炸物偏多(可能是我們點菜能力過弱)；不過店家對於食材新鮮有信心，敢推出生牛肉這道刺身，吃起來甘甜生津，推薦給敢嘗試的人。橘醋喜相逢也吃得到食材的鮮度，可解炸物的膩。
啤酒種類過多，不如告知服務人員想嘗試的口味，請他們推薦比較有效率，而且他們掌握口味的精準度蠻高。
惟一的小遺憾就是價格偏高，其他如：食材、餐點、服務可以給到4‧5顆星，適合朋友聚餐小酌。","Visit the same series of ABV bars for two consecutive weeks, go to the American bar last week, and come to the Japanese bar this week.The style of the two is very different, the same thing is amazing wine cabinets and beer types.
The meal of the Japanese -style izakaya is salty, and the fried items are too much (maybe we have too weak our order); People.Orange vinegar also eats the freshness of the ingredients, which can solve the greasy fried object.
There are too many types of beer. It is better to inform the service staff the taste that they want to try. Please recommend it more efficient, and the accuracy of their taste is quite high.
The only little regret is the high price, others such as: ingredients, meals, and services can be given 4 ‧5 stars, which is suitable for friends to dinner."
"四人套餐品項超多，好吃又豐盛，唐揚炸雞皮超脆，但居酒屋的特色就是聲音嘈雜，每個人都盡情的高談闊論，講話都要很大聲才聽得到，喉嚨都快啞了。

稱讚一下服務生弟弟們帥氣又親切，很棒！","There are many sets of four sets in the four people, delicious and rich, and Tang Yang fried chicken skin is super crispy, but the characteristics of the izakaya are noisy sounds. Everyone talks about it. The speech must be heard loudly, and the throat is dumb.

Praise the waiter brothers handsome and kind, great!"
"是一家上菜速度極～慢～的居酒屋
綜合評論滿分100大概是30分吧
我們點了玉子燒 雞肉串 生牛肉  大阪燒 烏龍麵
體感上
空盤收走在繼續等等等 聊天
沒有認真細算
每道大概要等10-20分吧
餐桌上絕對沒有同時存在兩道
而且餐點不是熱的（除了烏龍麵 烏龍麵好吃）
上菜速度慢加上餐點溫溫冷冷 也沒有特別好吃
吃起來不過癮
不曉得其他評論照片餐桌上豐富的餐點
也是其他客人等很久上齊才拍
還是我們這次是特例
人手不足？？這個就不清楚了
另外 服務生幫我們安排在門口
人進進出出
一直吹冷風
詢問店員是否能改坐到最前面那桌
店員說 有人訂位抱歉沒辦法
（這個觀念我也是不太懂，在其他客人還沒來時不能換位置… ）
但店員說無法也只能這樣子
朋友吃到後來頭很痛
還把羽絨衣蓋在大腿上
現在我回到家頭也好痛…..😢
不過會多給一顆星是朋友生日
店家幫蛋糕裝飾的蠻漂亮還可以給冰蛋糕
服務還可以
（雖然一樣等～很～久😂
PS 蛋糕是我們另外從蛋糕店買的","It is a izakaya with a very much food speed ~ slow ~ slow ~

There are definitely no two at the same time on the table

In addition, the waiter helps us arrange at the door
People enter and exit
Always blow cold wind

But the clerk said that he could not be like this

Cover the down jacket on the thigh

The meals I ordered that day are suitable for 2-3 people to share together."
"很典型的居酒屋的體驗—歡樂的氣氛、吵雜的環境。怕吵的人建議不要跟自己過不去，不怕吵的客人應該可以非常愉快的加入這熱鬧的行列。

菜色的種類非常的多樣，也都非常的好吃，基本上沒有什麼雷，燒烤的肉串類的熟度都是恰到好處，特別喜歡生牛肉和韓風辣醬魚生，連納豆都令人意外的美味可口！

啤酒的種類選擇也多到不勝枚舉，一整個冰櫃有著數百種啤酒，就在你不知該如何選擇的時候服務人員也會很貼心的提供建議。

服務人員的態度也很親切，迅速，清理空盤和加水都很主動，不用客人額外提醒；但我們有一道餐點因為服務人員漏點所以等了比較久才上菜，店家還主動招待了一份甜點作為補償，這樣的態度很令人願意再訪。","The experience of a typical izakaya -a happy atmosphere, noisy environment.Those who are afraid of noisy suggest that guests who do not live with themselves, and guests who are not afraid of noise should be able to join this lively ranked very happily.

The types of dishes are very diverse, and they are also very delicious. Basically, there is no thunder. The maturity of barbecue skewers is just right. I especially like raw beef and Korean hot sauce fish. Delicious and delicious!

There are many types of beer. There are hundreds of beer in the whole freezer. When you do n’t know how to choose, the service staff will also provide advice very intimately.

The attitude of the service staff is also very kind and fast. It is very active to clean up the empty disk and water, and do not need to remind guests; but we have a meal because the service staff missed the point for a long time before serving. As a compensation, this attitude is very willing to visit again."
"每月會有一個週日，舉辦主題品飲會，有機會挖掘精釀啤酒不一樣的面貌～😆（純粹的分享，不會推銷唷～👍)

餐點也是有許多好吃且有特色的，個人偏好綜合海鮮沙拉（口味清爽）、酥炸海苔鮮魷（越吃越順口）～❤️

此外，店裡面還有壓瓶蓋的工具器，可以把喜歡的瓶蓋壓扁扁帶回家唷～😂（但，我還喜歡撕酒標😆），不論是喜歡品酒、或是喜歡美食，都可以來嘗試看看唷～✌️","There will be one Sunday every month, holding the theme drinking meeting, and the opportunity to dig a different look of craft beer ~ 😆 (pure sharing, will not sell 唷 ~ 👍)

There are also many delicious and distinctive meals. Personal preferences comprehensive seafood salad (refreshing taste), crispy fried sea moss fresh squid (eat more and more smooth) ~ ❤️

In addition, there is a tool for pressing a bottle cap in the store, you can use the favorite bottle cap to flatten and flatten home 唷 ~ 😂 (but I also like to tear the wine label 😆), whether you like wine tasting or food or food. You can try it all ~ ✌ ✌️"
凱凱服務很好，餐點都很好吃、很入味，大阪燒很美味，串燒也很讚。,"Kaikai's service is very good, the meals are delicious, delicious, Osaka is delicious, and skewers are very good."
"帶有日式居酒屋的氛圍、

和洋兼併的色彩氛圍，懷舊、溫暖，且充滿生命力的「昭和氣息」，1930年代的古董音響，抬頭映入眼簾的仿日式宣紙隔板與歐洲壁燈的結合，呈現一種低調奢華的復古品味。

店內特色料理是，以無農藥稻草作為火候，生與熟之間融合，結合炙燒和煙燻的料理，保留了食材的口感與香氣多層次的享受。

剛開幕時來過一次，覺得還不錯，昨天經過二訪環境氛圍都很不錯，但介紹酒的時候就普通，唸了一大串感覺就是唸菜單的感覺自己挑想吃的口味，並沒有特別介紹，以前不會這樣，去過很多家不同的店，第一次和朋友來想喝酒只喝了一杯就不想再點了，我想我應該不會再去了,"I came once when I first opened, and I felt pretty good. Yesterday, I was very good after the second visit environment atmosphere, but when I introduced the wine, I was normal. I read a lot of feelings. , I ca n’t do this before. I have been to many different stores. For the first time, I wanted to drink with my friends to drink only one drink. I do n’t want to order it anymore."
沙拉牛肉好吃！但其他餐點口味沒什麼特色，味噌豬頸肉沾醬沒有味噌風味，牛腸鍋吃起來像牛肚。多款精釀啤酒應該才是餐廳特色，但這次沒喝啤酒CP值不推⋯,"Salad beef is delicious!However, there is no special feature of other meals. Miso pork neck meat dipped in sauce without miso flavor.A variety of craft beer should be the characteristics of the restaurant, but this time I didn’t drink beer CP."
起司明太子玉子燒好吃、鮭魚稻草燒還好，醬油有點太淡、鹽燒雞肉串跟名古屋手羽先份量夠但有點太鹹。啤酒選項很多，有很多在歐洲愛喝但台灣難買到的啤酒；服務的小姐很熱心介紹啤酒，服務態度也很好。,"The cheese, the prince of the prince, is delicious, and the salmon straw is okay. The soy sauce is a bit too light.There are many beer options, and there are many beer that loves to drink in Europe but it is difficult to buy in Taiwan. The service lady is enthusiastic about introducing beer and the service attitude is also very good."

ABV日式居酒館位於中山站附近的居酒屋，超過300款世界精釀啤酒搭配日式居酒屋文化，喝啤酒可以搭配關西風料理及鍋物。很適合吃完晚餐來續攤吃宵夜。

ABV最大的特色就是有300款啤酒大冰箱，世界各地各式各樣的啤酒可以挑選，且每週更換款式🍺 可以根據自己的喜好請店員推薦，不管是白啤酒、水果啤酒、清爽、特殊風味都應有盡有。這次試了很特別的杏桃啤酒，濃郁的杏桃香味卻乾爽順暢的香甜口感，甜而不膩。

稻草燒特盛是一道以枯乾稻草烹燒鮮魚的料理，具有獨特的稻草燻香風味，使得生魚片更加特色。尾道燒是廣島燒的特別版，內餡加入雞胗和魷魚，味道新穎，值得一試。蒲燒鰻釜飯是一道以鰻魚和濃郁的蒲燒醬汁為主要材料的料理。鰻魚本身鮮嫩多汁，沾上蒲燒醬汁後更加美味，飯粒入口鬆軟且有嚼勁。彩虹炸蝦天婦羅則是將日本彩色米果和麵包粉混合成為鮮蝦的麵衣，色彩繽紛美麗。名古屋手羽先是將炸過的雞翅塗上八丁味增醬烤製而成。明太子雞肉燒我這次很喜歡，充滿高麗菜、蛋、麵糊以及大量的明太子，並特別製作了明太子美乃滋淋在大阪燒和照燒雞腿肉上，味道十分美味。","• Straw Roasted Sheng Sheng $ 720

The ABV Japanese -style tavern is located in the izakaya near Zhongshan Station. More than 300 world craft beer with Japanese -style izakaya culture. Drinking beer can be matched with Guan Xifeng dishes and pots.It is very suitable for dinner to renew the stall for supper.

The biggest feature of ABV is that there are 300 beer refrigerators. Various beers around the world can be selected, and replacement of styles every week 🍺 can be recommended according to their preferences. Whether it is white beer, fruit beer, refreshing, special flavor There are everything.This time I tried very special apricot beer. The rich apricot aroma was dry and smooth, sweet but not greasy.

Taski is a dish for fresh fish with dry straw. It has a unique straw flavor flavor, making the sashimi of the sashimi more distinctive.The tail road is a special version of Hiroshima. The filling is added with chicken and squid. The taste is novel and worth trying.Po -roasted eel rice is a dish with eel and rich Pucao sauce as the main ingredients.The eel itself is tender and juicy, and it is more delicious after the sauce is covered with Pu -roast sauce.Rainbow fried shrimp mixed with Japanese color rice fruit and bread flour into the noodles of fresh shrimp, colorful and beautiful.The Nagoya Handu first coated the fried chicken wings with Badidi sauce.I like Chicken Chicken Boiling this time. It is full of cabbage, eggs, batter and a large number of Ming princes. It also specially produced the Osaka Mamiki on Osaka roasted and shochu chicken legs. The taste is very delicious."
"必須說明太子起司玉子燒跟炸牡蠣很美味， 花魚一夜乾跟清酒蒜味牡蠣還ok, 但串燒就蠻雷的，點牛舌前，店員就有強調他們是選舌根的部位，會比較有嚼勁，真的吃起來好像在吃雞胗（店員算誠實）， 雪花牛金針菇的牛肉很老就算了，不知為何有禽類的內臟味。 很多人推的彩虹天婦羅，那個加了米果的麵衣我也是吃不懂。
因為開車所以只點了一瓶白啤酒。兩個人這樣3800，我是覺得蠻貴的。","It must be explained that the prince's cheese Yuzi roasted and fried oysters are delicious. The flowers and fish are also ok overnight, but the skewers are quite thunderous. Before ordering the beef tongue, the clerk emphasizes that they are part of the tongue root. It is more chewy. It really tastes like eating chicken gangsters (the clerk is honest). The beef of the snowflake bulls and enoki mushrooms is very old. I do n’t know why there is the internal smell of poultry.Many people pushed the rainbow tempura, and I couldn't understand the noodle with rice fruit.
Because I drove, I only ordered a bottle of white beer.I think it is quite expensive."
"推薦大家吃大阪燒，真的很好吃！生魚片也很棒，有入口即化的感覺！可惜的是服務生推薦的啤酒還蠻普通的，個人沒有覺得特別好喝
總體而言，食物做的很精緻好吃！","It is really delicious to recommend everyone to eat Osaka.The sashimi is also great, and it feels like the entrance!Unfortunately, the beer recommended by the waiter is quite ordinary, and I don’t think it is particularly delicious.
Overall, the food is very delicate and delicious!"
"ABV氣氛還不錯東西也還不錯，菜都挺好吃，店內有點吵不太好聊天有些可惜。

啤酒種類很多，店員會幫忙推薦。可惜有些人的啤酒沒有點到合口味的，￼但我們每個人都點不同的，可以看看別人點了什麼。","The atmosphere of ABV is not bad and good. The dishes are delicious. It is a pity that it is a bit noisy in the store.

There are many types of beer, and the store staff will help recommend it.Unfortunately, some people's beer is not ordered, but each of us is different, we can see what others ordered."
"美式日本菜，像是在關島路上一家氣氛很好，東西不會太差，而且算好拍照的餐廳的那種感覺

油炸&美乃滋的華麗演出

海鮮一般人會喜歡有蝦 有蟹 有魚 還有鮭

但對海鮮要求點的難搞人會覺得（omg又來騙，牡蠣很肥沒有牡蠣香，炸物很多裹粉裹爆加倍放大，然後有鮭魚就是先負面的主觀印象扣分.....）

食物部分很討喜的好吃那種，但不是真的很好吃的那種（靠唄也太好吃了吧）的好吃

雞肉 豬肉 牛肉 比起一般台菜館子好吃很多，肉不乾有入味卻沒死鹹死甜感，生菜類給的算有誠意，沒有美生菜就是用心跟沒心的分水嶺，燒烤串醬汁甜味一拜油門踩到底，喝酒唰嘴一口接一口，廣島燒&大阪燒q比給好給滿，雙唇白泡饗宴，酒就是要繼續喝下去。

然後最後甜點是一口天堂一口地獄的反差小幽默，酥皮麻糬很可以內餡的小巧思小驚喜鹹甜鹹甜很喜歡，然後蕨餅到底是想用味道已經是臭酸米麴逼死舌頭到什麼程度，前面的味覺已經被澱粉 油脂 肉蛋白輪戰到麻痺，甜點直接喚醒味覺神經，店家的味覺哲學思想我覺得很有趣。

食物部分大概只能有3

但畢竟他是精釀啤酒館，脾酒種類品項分布區域廣度還是很不錯的感覺，精釀啤酒我真的不太懂，只管好不好喝，這裡啤酒好喝給讚一個。

服務上現場的外場工作人員都蠻不錯的，口語 應對 拿捏的很好，晚餐時段滿桌也沒有不耐煩 急躁感，服務上熱情但不會給人壓迫感。

整體上體驗還行，之後重點就放在酒上，菜要認真看一下再點，會再來但必須有人約。","American Japanese cuisine, like a good atmosphere on the Guam Road, is not too bad, and the feeling of taking pictures of the restaurant that takes pictures is good

The gorgeous performance of fried & Monizes

Ordinary people of seafood will like with shrimp, crab, fish, salmon, and salmon

However, people who need to be demanded by seafood will feel (OMG is here to deceive again, oysters are very fat and without oyster aroma, many fried powder wraps and wraps doubles, and then there is a negative subjective impression with salmon ..... .

The food part is very pleasant and delicious, but it is not really delicious (it is too delicious by relying on it)

Chicken pork and beef are much more delicious than ordinary Taiwanese restaurants. The meat is not dry but not dead and dead. The lettuce is sincere. There is no such thing as a bean. Bei Yi worshiped the accelerator to the end.

Then the last dessert is a small humor in heaven and hell. The small ingenuity of the messenger can be stuffed with a small surprise, salty, salty and sweet. To what extent, the previous taste has been challenged by starchy fat meat protein to paralysis, and desserts directly awaken the flavor nerves. I feel very interesting in the taste philosophy of the store.

There can only be 3 food parts.

But after all, he is a craft beerhouse. The breadth of the distribution of spleen wine types is still very good. I really do n’t understand the craft beer.

The staff on the scene at the scene were pretty good. Spoken language responded very well. During dinner, there was no impatience and irritability. The service was enthusiastic but not a sense of oppression.

The overall experience is okay. After that, the focus is on the wine. Take a serious look at the dishes and then come again."
"店內超大冰箱真的太壯觀了，超過300款世界精釀啤酒任您挑！

🔸胡麻豚肉豆腐沙拉🥗
很巨大一盆，醬汁味道也蠻好的，不過冷豬肉油脂凝固有點可怕🤣然後因為豆腐會出水，最後生菜都會浸在濕濕的醬汁😅下次應該會點海鮮沙拉！
🔹柳葉魚甘露煮
標準甘露煮風味～甜甜的醬汁，是好吃的涼菜！
🔸蒲燒鰻玉子燒
這道讚！鬆軟的玉子燒裡面包著一口蒲燒鰻，口感豐富又多了鹹甜滋味😋
🔹 辣味醬燒七味牛
調味蠻辣的！牛肉的話是有嚼勁那種，配料鴻禧菇做醬燒倒是很好吃
🔸青蔥肥腸串
蔥的存在感微低～但肥腸處理得很好😋裡面的肥油清得蠻乾淨不會太膩口！
🔹蔥鹽雞肉串
這道我沒有趁熱吃🥲無法評斷🤣 但覺得調味偏淡～
🔸彩虹炸蝦天婦羅
炸蝦還蠻新鮮的，總共四隻～不過炸地瓜有吃到沒熟的粉🥺

炸乳酪淋上巴薩米克醋再配芝麻葉，蠻爽口開胃！
🔸清酒蒜味奶油貝
非常讚😍湯頭充滿貝類的鮮和奶油的香～料的部分也不少！
🔹韭菜牡蠣廣島燒
韭菜的風味不太明顯，主要是吃美乃滋跟麵的感覺😅牡蠣蠻大顆的！
🔸黑糖蜜蕨餅
跟印象中的蕨餅吃起來不大一樣，整個是冰涼的有點像涼糕，但加上黑糖和黃豆粉整體還是不錯吃～

餐廳環境很日式，現場有很多國家的啤酒可以選擇，當場也會有服務人員會貼心的依照你的喜好來為您推薦酒類，以服務來說很不錯！餐點部分，生牛肉跟烤肥腸串串無敵值得點的👍👍👍，價格部分稍微高了一點，但整體來說，是家可以再來的一家餐廳。,"The restaurant environment is very Japanese.

"⚠️會員集點集了個心酸，在這裏會員也只是過路客待遇⚠️
疫情期間無法內用但瘋狂外帶啤酒的結果就是滿滿的10%-100%集點卡而且循環好幾輪，台北有多家門市，所以從一開始隨便店員提供的集點卡%數，後來習慣性直接跟店員索取欠缺的%數集點卡，一個平均集點的概念。
疫情後得知原來集點卡可以兌換餐點，開開心心的跟朋友們在東區消費了好幾次，東區幾間店態度都很好，畢竟專業的店員都知道集點卡每一個貼紙都是$$$累積的，我也不是奧客，理解集點卡兌餐還是要達到低消，而每次大家各自付酒錢就能達到低消，實為雙贏。
疫情後還是有繼續外帶啤酒的習慣，常常是臨時起意，東區幾家店的店員都會從善如流直接給我指定%數的集點卡⋯⋯⋯
唯獨今日中山店一位戴眼鏡的男店員，給集點卡給的不甘不脆，好像我在做無理要求似的，堅持要我提供已經有集滿的50%集點卡才能給60%集點卡⋯好說歹說我真的是臨時起意，集點卡都在家裡沒帶出門，他仍堅持如果無法提供，只能給我10%集點卡⋯🙄
好吧，如果中山店這麼不尊重長期消費的會員、這麼不知變通，那我也拒絕到中山店消費，反正店員態度是只想做過路客生意，不缺業績🙄
喔，然後我回家發現我有兩張集滿的50%集點卡，呵呵🙄","了️ Member Collection gathers a soreness, where the members are just passers -by ⚠️
The result of being unable to use it during the epidemic but the result of crazy take-off beer is the full 10%-100%set card and several rounds of circulation. There are many stores in Taipei. Habits directly to obtain the lacking%set card with the store clerk, a concept of average set point.
After the epidemic, I learned that the original set of cards can be redeemed for meals. The happily spent several times with friends in the Eastern District. Several stores in the Eastern District are very good. After all, professional shopists know that every sticker of the collection card is the stickers are all stickers are all stickers. The accumulation of $ 6, I am not a guest. I understand that the collection of the collection card is still low, and each time everyone pays the wine, it can reach low, which is a win -win situation.
After the epidemic, there is still the habit of continuing to take off beer. It is often temporarily. The staff of several stores in the Eastern District will directly specify the set of sets of sets of%of the number of%.
Only a male clerk wearing glasses in Zhongshan Store today is unwilling to give a set of cards, as if I am doing unreasonable requirements, insist on asking me to provide a 50%set card with a full collection of cards to give 60%to 60%. The collection card is good to say, saying that I really take a temporary intention. The collection card is not taken out at home. He still insists that if you cannot provide it, you can only give me a 10%set card ⋯ 🙄 🙄 🙄
Well, if the Zhongshan Store does not respect the long -term consumption members and does not know how to change, then I also refuse to go to Zhongshan Store for consumption.
Oh, then I went home and found that I had two 50%set cards full, haha"

"今天跟朋友到貴店用餐，餐點好吃、酒好喝，服務也不錯。但是在用餐的最後，發生了一件令人無法理解的事情。

事情始末是這樣的，我們最初被告知用餐時間到晚上6點半，因為餐點好吃，我們在接近6點時想再加點，考慮到只剩半小時，我們特地向服務生再次確認最後的用餐時間。服務生告知我們可以用餐至晚上9點，這讓我們很高興，於是放心地加點了更多餐點和酒。

然而，當時間來到晚上7點50分時，另一位服務生突然告訴我們，用餐時間只剩下10分鐘。這讓我們感到十分錯愕，因為還有許多餐點沒吃完，而我們本來是以可以用餐到9點為前提進行加點的。最終我們只能傻眼的配合結束這次用餐。

讓我們無法接受的是，我們完全依照服務生回覆的用餐時間進行安排，被告知可以用餐到9點，卻在接近8點時突然被縮短至8點結束。我們兩人消費了3432元，但有接近三分之一的餐點沒有吃完。這樣的安排對顧客來說非常不合理，且缺乏應有的誠信。我們是根據餐廳提供的訊息來決定是否加點，這些突然的變更不應由顧客來承擔後果，這對大多數顧客而言應該都無法接受。

可以理解貴店有你們的運營安排，但作為顧客，我們應該有權利期望餐廳提供合理且一致的資訊，這應該也是基本的服務標準。希望餐廳能反思並改進溝通方式，避免其他顧客也遇到類似的不愉快經歷，謝謝。","Today, I went to your friends to dine with friends. The meal was delicious, drinking delicious, and good service.But at the end of the meal, an incomprehensible thing happened.

This is the case at the beginning and end of the matter. We were initially informed that the meal time was 6:30 in the evening. Because the meal was delicious, we wanted to add some more when we were close to 6 o'clock. Considering that there were only half an hour left, we specifically confirmed the last again. Meal time.The waiter told us that we could dine until 9pm, which made us very happy, so I assured more meals and wine.

However, when the time came at 7:50 pm, another waiter suddenly told us that the meal time was only 10 minutes.This makes us feel very wrong, because there are still many meals that have not been eaten, and we originally added points on the premise that we can eat until 9 o'clock.In the end, we can only cooperate dumbly to end this meal.

What we ca n’t accept is that we arrange for the meal time that the waiter responded to, and the meals were told that we could eat until 9 o'clock, but it was suddenly shortened to the end of 8 o'clock when it was near 8 o'clock.The two of us spent 3432 yuan, but nearly one -third of the meals were not eaten.Such arrangements are very unreasonable for customers and lack the due integrity.We decide whether to add points based on the message provided by the restaurant. These sudden changes should not be assumed by customers, which should not be acceptable for most customers.

You can understand that your store has your operation arrangements, but as a customer, we should have the right to expect the restaurant to provide reasonable and consistent information. This should also be basic service standards.I hope that the restaurant can reflect and improve the communication method, and avoid other customers from encountering similar unpleasant experiences, thank you."

剛好平日的時候來聚餐，所以客人沒有很多，用餐環境相對舒適不吵雜，上餐迅速，也不會強迫推銷酒類或餐點，是很舒服的用餐體驗。,"It happened to be dinner on weekdays, so there are not many guests. The dining environment is relatively comfortable and not noisy. The meal is fast, and it will not force the sales or meals. It is a very comfortable dining experience."

Raw fish slices are also very good, the disadvantage is that the soy sauce is not delicious enough
The noodles wrapped in Nanako fried chicken are a bit, but the chicken is delicious

Sky pork tofu is also fragrant and appetizing
Even if the skewed part is ordinary, the food is not hot when serving

最最大推蔥鹽雞腿串燒，皮烤的很酥脆，肉也非常軟嫩，必點！！
味噌松阪豬第二名，很入味肉質也好吃😇😇

店員服務態度大致親切，精釀啤酒種類豐富，但店員的介紹可以再更精進，讓客人會比較知道點什麼比較好

會想再去吃的一家居酒屋：）","Every dish is good
The largest push onion and salt chicken legs are skewed. The skin is very crispy, and the meat is very soft, must be ordered!Intersection
Miso Matsusaka Pig is the second place, which is very delicious and delicious 😇😇

The service attitude of the clerk is roughly cordial, and the types of craft beer are rich, but the introduction of the clerk can be more advanced, so that guests will know what is better.

A house where you want to eat again :)"
"餐點好吃的日式餐酒館，平日晚上生意一樣超極好，與朋友兩人點了6道餐點，兩千元左右，價位不算便宜。

*蒲鰻魚玉子燒：鰻魚夾雜在玉子中間，非常小塊，鰻魚味道沒有凸顯出來，沒有很推薦這道。

*照燒牛肉燒：第一次嘗試廣島燒，非常滿意這道的表現🥰原本看到起司以為會很膩，但炒麵吃起來甜中帶酸，有種神奇解膩的效果，滿推這道的👍

*火烤辣味噌中卷：中卷的碳香氣味十足，表皮微焦但口感不會老，烤功還不錯，不過沒有很喜歡辣味噌，原本以為是中卷醃製後再火烤，但醬是中卷烤完後，另外擠上去的，吃起來有點主題跟醬分離的感覺，且醬偏鹹，敗在醬的部分有點小可惜。

*金針雪牛串：有烤到逼出油花，吃起來不會膩，烤肉醬的味道也很棒，滿喜歡這道的😘

*蔥鹽雞肉串：這道是鹽烤，用蔥鹽調味，雞肉口感很嫩，這道也很推😋

*梅肉風味牡蠣揚：牡蠣的粉不會太厚，油也有瀝乾，沾醬是梅肉醬，特色有加分，但風味就普通了，而且吃完沒什麼記憶點","The delicious Japanese -style dining tavern is as super very good as the business on the evening. It ordered 6 meals with friends, about 2,000 yuan, and the price is not cheap.

*Pu Eel Jade Burning: Eels are mixed in the middle of Jade, very small, and the taste of the eel is not highlighted. It is not recommended.

*Zhaoyan beef roasted: For the first time I tried Hiroshima, I was very satisfied with the performance. I originally saw that the cheese thought it would be greasy, but the fried noodles were sweet and sour, and there was a magical effect. Taoist 👍

*Hot baked and spicy miso midfield: The carbon aroma of the middle roll is full, the epidermis is slightly burnt, but the taste will not be old, and the grilled skills are not bad, but I do n’t like spicy miso. I originally thought it was marinated in the middle roll. After the sauce is grilled, it is squeezed up. It feels a bit of the theme to separate the theme from the sauce, and the sauce is salty, and the part of the sauce is a bit unfortunate.

*Golden Needle Snow Cow Symbnis: There are roasted to force oil flowers, it will not taste greasy, and the taste of barbecue sauce is also great.

*Onion salt chicken skewers: This is salt grilled, seasoned with onion and salt, the chicken taste is very tender, this is also pushed

*Meat meat flavor oysters: The oyster powder will not be too thick, the oil is also drained, the dipping sauce is plum meat sauce, the characteristics are added, but the flavor is ordinary, and there is no memory point after eating."

"一家號稱擁有數百款啤酒種類的日式居酒屋，是我第一次帶著我的新交往對象來這約會，憑著之前的好印象，想說應該是百利而無一害才是，結果還是讓我們在找出一點瑕疵，就請看官們自行斟酌，理性評斷吧！
先說優點的部份，環境及氛圍都還是一樣令人放鬆，胡麻豬肉豆腐跟唐揚雞塊依舊份量滿點、營養滿點、美味滿點，廚房在處理食材時，是從頭到尾，一次處理過後再自行做醃製及加工，而不是直接買半成品來節省時間，這一點還蠻難能可貴的！因為新歡個性還蠻大剌剌地，服務人員也還蠻懂得看臉色，隨時按照客人的喜好來進行服務，這一點還蠻討喜的。款式多到令人目不暇給的啤酒種類，還是一樣新奇又好喝，當天的鰻魚玉子燒，完全打趴前晚在正統日料店所吃到的品項，表面微微的焦黃，讓人覺得整個蛋煎收尾收得挺好的，味道也真的是好吃極了！
但美中不足的是，烤鯖魚的魚體本身，沒有先完全退完冰就直接進行燒烤過程，讓魚肉吃起來沒那麼燙口跟Q綿，有些區塊明顯地看起來會皺在一塊，是覺得蠻可惜的；而且醬汁稍微偏甜，比較期待可以嚐到魚肉本身的甜味，而不是人工甘味。
小小建議，希望店家可以聽得進去......但還是一家值得推薦的聚餐好去處，有機會還是可以邀請三五好友，一起在這飲小酒，饌小食的👍

德式輕飲系品飲會照片更新登錄😊","A Japanese -style izakaya, which claims to have hundreds of beer, is the first time I have brought my new target to date. With the previous good impression, I want to say that it should be Baili and no harm. Let's find a little flaw, please consider the officials and judge rationally!
Let's talk about the advantages first. The environment and atmosphere are still the same relaxed. Sky pork tofu and Tang Yang chicken pieces are still full, full of nutrition, and delicious. After the processing, it will be marinated and processed by itself instead of buying semi -finished products to save time. This is quite valuable!Because Xinhuan's personality is quite stubborn, and the service staff also knows how to look at the face, and the service is used at any time according to the guest's preferences. This is quite pleasing.There are so many types of beer types, which are still the same novel and delicious. On the day of the eel Yumi burning, the items eaten at the orthodox Japanese restaurant shop were completely yellowed, and the surface was slightly brilliant. The egg fried end is very good, and the taste is really delicious!
But the disadvantage of the beauty is that the fish body of the grilled catfish itself, without completely retreating, directly perform the barbecue process, so that the fish meat is not so hot and Q cotton. Some blocks obviously look wrinkled. I feel pretty unfortunate; and the sauce is slightly sweet, and I look forward to the sweetness of the fish itself, not artificial sweetness.
Small suggestions, I hope that the store can hear it ... but it is still a recommended dinner where it is recommended. If you have the opportunity, you can invite three or five friends to drink small wine here and crickets.

明太子薯條擠了一大坨超級多的美乃滋，真的太多，且醬還是冰的..
….雞翅很死鹹，也不酥脆，很少吃到這麼難吃的烤雞翅@@ 其他食物也不及格，不是一堆美乃滋就是死鹹，很難想像在中山區這有這麼瞎的日式料理！往往都是這樣，很花冤枉錢買教訓，不可能有下次了！（果然要看最差評價才是真的，網友說的話要聽！）","The raw fish fillet is not complete, and it is not fresh (the color of watching the sashimi at the table at the moment of the table feels not new!) After eating it, it is not good to eat it. Eat it, but go home and diarrhea!

…. Chicken wings are dead and salty, and they are not crispy. They rarely eat such unpalatable roast chicken wings @@… Other foods are not fit. It is either a pile of beauty or death.

"與朋友來居酒屋用餐和小酌一杯，

"2022.02.05到訪  (個人給4.8顆星)
日式居酒屋內供應上百款啤酒，能藉此品嚐眾多不同風味的體驗。

當天7大1小到訪餐聚，點了""5~6人分享餐""便足夠大家享用。

師傅手藝夠水準，餐食料理有創意!

""龍蝦沙拉炸薯條""薯條配上龍蝦沙拉絕妙搭配；
""蒲燒鰻玉子燒"" 有創意但感覺味道不到驚豔的程度；
""梅肉風味牡蠣揚""好味但吃不出牡蠣的肥美；

三五朋友小聚的好選擇!","2022.02.05 Visit (individual gives 4.8 stars)
Hundreds of beer in Japanese -style izakaya can taste many different flavors of experience.

On the same day, the 7 major and 1 small visited meal gathered, and the ""5 ~ 6 people shared meals"" was enough for everyone to enjoy.

The master's craftsmanship is high enough, and the meals are creative!
""Veluration Pork Tofu Salad"" has a unique flavor and a lot of weight;
""Nanzhu Wind Fried Chicken"" inner meat is soft and tender;
""Lobster salad fried fries"" French fries with lobster salad are beautifully matched;
""Pu Burning Eel Jade Burning"" has a creative but not stunning;
""Meat meat flavor oyster"" is good but can not eat the fat of oysters;
""Perhaps fried hemp"" ""Skin is crispy, and the taste of peanut powder is very good.

A good choice for three or five friends!"
"三人來這裡慶祝生日，每一道料理都看起來很好吃，想點個3~4人套餐被店員阻止說我們應該吃不完。後來我們改點單點，實際吃過以後發現幸好有按照店員的建議點餐，因為有些餐點的份量真的很大。

個人最喜歡唐揚雞和牛肉稻草燒沙拉。唐揚雞應該是有用薑醃漬去腥，鮮嫩多汁。而我本身喜歡吃生肉，稻草燒的口感及味道讓我很喜歡，沙拉也非常地足夠。酒的部分玲瑯滿目，然而我不喝酒，我的朋友也配合我只點了兩罐酒自己喝。很遺憾不能為一間日式居酒屋在酒方面給出評論。

生日壽星提供的紅豆酸奶蕨餅，蕨餅的部分好吃，但是紅豆酸奶的口感實在有點奇妙，非常地甜，可是又會有酸奶的發酵酸臭味，玉子燒和生魚片也稍嫌薄弱。可惜吃得不多一餐只能點過這些食物，店內還有更多的餐點可選。

當時我們的用餐時間在下午五點半，時間是兩個小時。以上班族下班聚會來說是個不錯的地點，可以大聲聊天，餐點也不錯吃。希望有機會能再訪吃看看其他的料理。","The three came here to celebrate their birthdays. Each dish looks delicious. I want to order a 3 ~ 4 set meal and stop the clerk that we should not finish.Later, we changed to a single order. After eating, I found that fortunately, we ordered to order at the suggestion of the clerk, because the amount of some meals is really large.

Personally like Tang Yang chicken and beef and straw roast salad.Tang Yang chicken should be marinated with ginger and fishy, ​​fresh and juicy.And I like to eat raw meat. The taste and taste of straw burning make me like it, and the salad is very sufficient.The wine part of the wine is full, but I do n’t drink, and my friends also cooperate with me to drink only two pots of wine.Unfortunately, it is not possible to comment on a Japanese -style izakaya in wine.

The red bean yogurt fern cake provided by the birthday stars, part of the fern cake is delicious, but the taste of red bean yogurt is really amazing, very sweet, but there will be yogurt's fermented sour smell, and Yizi roasted and sashimi slices are slightly weak. EssenceUnfortunately, you can only order these foods for eating less meals, and there are more meals in the store.

At that time, our meal time was at 5:30 pm, and the time was two hours.The above teams are a good place to meet. You can chat loudly, and the meal is also good.I hope to have the opportunity to visit and eat other dishes."
服務佳，酒品項來說是目前看過居酒屋中最多的！（有100多種！）當你在冰箱前呆滯的時候，服務人員會開始推薦。莎拉大盤清爽、蔥燒肥腸太有韌性～蔥薑雞肉串有點太鹹外，其他大致來說都不錯。,"For good service, wine items are currently the most in izakaya!(There are more than 100 kinds!) When you are dull in front of the refrigerator, the service staff will start recommending.The Sarahlet is refreshing, and the onion burning fat intestines are too tough ~ onion ginger chicken skewers are a bit too salty, and others are roughly good."
如果以「聚會餐廳」的標準來評比，我願意給5顆星。酒很多選擇，口味超多而且品質很不錯！食物也OK。但是如果要以專門居酒屋的標準來評比，那就只能給3顆星了。但今天的酒蒸蛤蜊沒吐沙吐好，有幾顆有沙有一顆完全是沙，只好再扣一顆星了，就2顆吧。,"If you evaluate the standard of ""gathering restaurants"", I am willing to give 5 stars.There are many choices for wine, with a lot of taste and good quality!Food is also ok.But if you want to evaluate the standards of dedicated izakaya, you can only give 3 stars.But today's wine steamed clams did not spit the sand, and there were a few sand and one, and one was completely sand, so I had to buckle a star, just 2."
靠近中山捷運站，餐點不錯，啤酒種類很多，可以請店員幫忙介紹。,"Near Zhongshan MRT Station, the meal is good, there are many types of beer, you can ask the clerk to introduce it."
"跟好久不見的姐妹約在聚會

本店的招牌特色料理有大阪燒、廣島燒、稻草燒、串物等，以為日本料理適合搭配清酒或梅酒、水果酒，這家是搭配近300多種的世界精釀啤酒，真是開了眼界！
兩個人今晚點了大阪燒的「明太子雞肉燒」，明太子沙拉醬的鹹甜搭配底下高麗菜絲的爽口讓雞肉吃起來特別多汁；「蔥鹽雞肉串」的蔥鹽醃製的鹹香將煙燻後略帶脆感表面的雞肉串帶出彈嫩清爽；「鮭魚稻草燒」是江戶時代流傳至今的漁夫料理，有別於一般日本料理店使用瓦斯槍煙燻生魚片，ABV是採用烈火燒枯乾稻草產生的獨特香氣入味在鮭魚表面佐以桔片與白蘿蔔絲以及手工磨製的哇沙米，原味入口嘴內瞬間溢滿稻草燒製過的獨特風味，相當有深度的口感令人回味。
美食當前搭配啤酒絕對是一大享受，點了有水蜜桃風味的精釀啤酒，淡淡的水果氣味搭配著不苦的啤酒問口口感真是太滿足了！
我們兩個人就點了三道菜剛開始還以為會吃不飽，結果是相當的有飽足感呢！
送餐過程店員也會詢問關心對菜色的感受相當貼心，這次總共網羅了這間店的三種特色料理，還有好多樣都想試試，改天一定會再來！","A meeting with the sisters who hadn't seen a long time

The signature dishes of this shop include Osaka Roasted, Hiroshima Boil, Straw Roasted, String, etc. It is thought that Japanese cuisine is suitable for sake or plum wine and fruit wine. This is a world of craft beer with more than 300 kinds of world crafts, which is really eye -catching!
Tonight, the two people ordered the ""Burning Prince Chicken Boil"" of Osaka tonight. The chicken skewers with a slightly crispy surface of the smoke brings the tender and refreshing of the chicken skewers on the surface; ""salmon and straw burning"" is a fisherman cuisine circulating to this day in the Edo era. It is the unique aroma produced by burning dry and dry straw on the surface of the salmon surface with orange slices and white radish, and hand -grinded Waka rice. The taste is evocative.
Food is definitely a great enjoyment with beer. It ordered the craft beer with peach flavors. The faint fruits smell with a bitter beer to ask for a word of mouth is really satisfying!
The two of us ordered the three dishes and thought they would not be full at first, and the result was quite full!
The meal delivery process clerk will also ask about the care of the dishes. This time, a total of three special dishes of this shop have been online. There are also good to try, and they will definitely come again!"
"府中燒（大阪燒系列）：麵很乾，沒有炒過的感覺，不入味，不推

另外還點了明太子蓮藕、鹽焗雞、辣烤鮮魷，味道都很普

價位偏高，服務一般，以中山商圈串燒居酒屋林立的地方這間食物真的不行，啤酒種類多是唯一優點","Fuzhong Burning (Osaka Burning Series): The noodles are very dry.

In addition, I also ordered Prince Lotus Root, Salt Chicken, and Teasting fresh squid. The taste is very common.

The price is high and the service is average. This food is really not good in the Zhongshan business district."
中價位，食材新鮮，店內裝潢佳，酌收10%服務費。,"The mid -price location, fresh ingredients, good interior decoration, 10%service fee."
每一間都有自己的特色食物，而且真的跟日本吃起來幾乎一樣，每一道都是滿滿驚艷，而他們的酒真的感覺喝不完，每次到都可以喝到不一樣的東西，真正的吃不膩🤭,"Everyone has its own special food, and it is really the same as Japan.

🌀 料理部分不得不說，真的有相當高的水準，海鮮烹飪手法達高水準，海鮮嚼起來口感富含水分，也不失海鮮原先的風味。

🌀烤串的部分也是讓人驚艷，肉烤的不乾柴，咬下去都可以感受到肉質富含肉汁，實屬一道好的佳餚。

🌀啤酒的樣式也是琳瑯滿目，店員都會細心跟客人解釋每項啤酒的風味跟定調，值得肯定。","Izakaya izakaya is living in the downtown area, and the service is cordial and in place.

The cooking part has to be said that there is really a very high level. The seafood cooking method is high, and the taste of seafood is full of water. It also does not lose the original flavor of the seafood.

The part of the baking skewers is also amazing. The meat is not dry. You can feel that the meat is rich in gravy, which is a good dish.

The style of 式 beer is also full of. The clerk will carefully explain to the guests to explain the flavor and tone of each beer, which is worthy of recognition."
"還可以，但有點可惜，太吵了
海鮮中規中矩
炸牡蠣的醬有酸梅調味，蠻特別的
大腸鍋就有點失望了，以為會是像日本的脂肪QQ的，就是牛肚而已

"有非常多國家各種啤酒可以選擇的ABv
日式居酒屋館就在晶華飯店的後方
菜色好吃很下酒
別忘了把瓶蓋壓扁帶回家做紀念","There are ABVs that many beers can be selected in many countries
The Japanese -style izakaya hall is behind the Jinghua Hotel
The dishes are delicious
Don’t forget to put the bottle cap with flattened home to commemorate"
"晚上10點後的聚會好地方。已第三次來，鰻魚蛋卷真心大推，2個人點了兩盤。烤魚是表皮脆、肉質剛剛好。炸牡蠣也是必吃之選。另外啤酒日本的之前有好多款，疫情後好多都沒了😭。價格比一般居酒屋貴，找便宜CP值高的可能不是選擇。但要找有特色啤酒又餐點好吃，我會推薦這家。

另一扣分是其他食物像雞翅是廣島燒味，牛肉稍辣有點不好。","A good place after 10 pm.For the third time, the eel egg rolls were really pushed, and two people ordered two disks.The grilled fish is crispy and the meat is just right.Fried oysters are also a must -have.In addition, there were many models in Japan before, and many of them were gone after the epidemic.The price is more expensive than the average izakaya. Those who find a cheap CP value may not be a choice.But looking for special beer and delicious meals, I will recommend this one.

Another deduction is that other foods like chicken wings are Hiroshima, and the beef is slightly spicy."
上百種啤酒可以挑選，來自台灣、日本及歐洲；服務人員還會依個人喜好推薦啤酒給客人。兩個人談心或一群好友來聚會都很適合～,"Hundreds of beer can be selected, from Taiwan, Japan and Europe; service staff will also recommend beer to guests according to personal preference.It is very suitable for two people to talk or a group of friends to meet ~"
"很有意思的日式居酒館。
2020年的時候來的，現在菜單應該都更新了吧。
好懷念那個「稻草燒」，是很精緻的那種好吃，把裹在鮭魚外面的稻草燒掉來達到炙燒效果的料理，不沾醬就非常好吃了。","Very interesting Japanese -style tavern.
It came in 2020, and now the menu should be updated.
I miss the ""straw burning"", which is very delicate. It is very delicious to burn the straw wrapped outside the salmon to achieve the burning effect. It is very delicious without sauce."
"大推牛腸鍋，湯頭很不錯、用料也非常豐富，可以吃到很多青菜和蛋白質😋

骰子牛過鹹、炸蝦茄子煲有麻糬蠻特別的但整體來說每個食材互相不太搭，這兩道都小踩雷。龍蝦玉子燒還不錯，是龍蝦沙拉醬和很有口感的魚卵凍？(在玉子燒上方切塊的，實在不確定是什麼，但不錯吃)

整櫃啤酒真的很吸睛，還好有專業的店員推薦啤酒，當晚想喝比較草本的啤酒，經典Blue moon很可以！","Big pushing beef intestinal pot, the soup is very good, and the ingredients are very rich. You can eat a lot of greens and protein.

Dice beef is too salty, fried shrimp and eggplant pots are special, but overall, each ingredients are not very good, and these two are small.Lobster Yuzi is not bad.(Cut the block on the top of Yuzi, it is really not sure what it is, but it is good to eat)

The whole cabinet beer is really eye -catching. Fortunately, there are professional clerks to recommend beer. I wanted to drink more herbal beer that night. The classic Blue Moon is fine!"
剛好餐點都不對我的胃口,"I just have a meal, I don’t have an appetite"
大致上味道很不錯，龍蝦沙拉薯條真的吃的到龍蝦，干貝大阪燒真的吃的到干貝！除了炸豬排的豬排肉質太柴之外其他還沒踩到雷！啤酒真的是多國多樣化！很適合想出國出不了國的人來品嚐！,"The taste is very good. Lobster salad can really eat lobster.Except for the pork chop in the pork chop, the meat quality is too hard to step on the thunder!Beer is really diversified in many countries!It is very suitable for people who want to go abroad to taste!"
"餐點都不錯吃
適合朋友聚會的好場所
會再回訪的","The meals are good
A good place for friends to meet
Will back to visit"
"ABV 有好幾間不同元素的店
日式這間我是初訪，個人覺得一夜干和蛋捲很不錯，燒烤類還可以再更好
不過服務品質很讚！
適合晚上放鬆小聚，一樣有招牌的螢幕可以看球賽~","ABV has several shops of different elements
I am a first visit to the Japanese style. I personally think that the one -night dry and egg rolls are very good. Barbecue can be better.
But the quality of service is great!
Suitable for relaxation at night, there are also signature screens to watch the ball game ~"
"我們點了牛腸鍋、米棒鍋、透抽卷、明太子雞肉廣島燒、炒烏龍麵、烤鰹魚，火鍋類很特別，其他的份量偏少（尤其鰹魚），整體價格也比較高些，不過氣氛很不錯，服務態度也都蠻好的，牛腸鍋的牛腸好吃！蔬菜也很豐盛，湯頭很日式，米棒鍋很特別，像在吃湯泡飯，牛蒡很多！還有ㄧ些蓮藕跟菇類。兩種鍋物都有鳥蛋。我們大概四人點這樣蠻飽！食物部分ㄧ人大約500初！
啤酒種類多樣，很適合下班部門和好友聚餐小酌幾杯，不過會有點吵雜，講話要比較大聲。
最後店員還有送我們2021的年曆！感謝老闆！下次有機會再去吃吃其它的分店：）","We ordered beef intestine pot, rice stick pot, transparent roll, Ming Prince chicken boiled, fried oolong noodles, grilled catfish, hot pot is very special, other portions (especially catfish), the overall price is also relatively high Some, but the atmosphere is very good, the service attitude is also pretty good, the beef intestine pot is delicious!The vegetables are also very rich, the soup is very Japanese, and the rice stick pot is very special.There are also some lotus root and mushrooms.Both pots have bird eggs.We are so full of four people!The food part is about 500 early!
There are diverse types of beer, which is very suitable for the get off work departments to have a few drinks with friends, but it will be a bit noisy, and speaking is relatively loud.
Finally, the clerk also sent us the 2021 calendar!Thank you boss!Next time I have the opportunity to eat other branches :)"
氣氛很好、環境也不錯，男店員會很細心的幫你尋找想要喝的酒👍,The atmosphere is very good and the environment is good. The male clerk will help you find the wine you want to drink 👍
"每次到 ABV 最期待的就是好喝的啤酒，專業的啤酒推薦和解說也讓人印象深刻，而且工作人員都能幫忙挑到符合我們期待的口味。海鮮沙拉很大盤，口感很清爽，CP值頗高！不過另外點的照燒軟骨雞肉丸口感偏乾，雖然沾上附的生蛋黃吃有比較好一點，但還是覺得可以把錢留下來多點一支啤酒，或點其他的下酒菜。

啤酒瓶上的貼紙集滿十個可以換會員折扣，如果會再訪可以請工作人員提供集點卡！","Every time I go to ABV, the most anticipated beer. Professional beer recommendation and reconciliation are also impressive, and the staff can help pick up the tastes we expect.The seafood salad is very large, the taste is very refreshing, and the CP value is quite high!However, the taste of the roasted cartilage chicken balls is dry. Although it is better to eat raw egg yolk attached to it, I still feel that you can leave the money more beer or order other jams.

The stickers on the beer bottle are full of ten members to change membership discounts. If you visit again, you can ask the staff to provide a collection card!"
"啤酒絕對是這邊的特色！
種類繁多，若不知道該如何下手，詢問店員是好選擇，將會依照個人喜好逐一篩選出理想的啤酒！

餐點份量以個人來說偏多一點點，建議斟酌點餐～口味個人認為蠻不錯吃的但整體偏鹹(不過這本來就是見仁見智)

氣氛很適合情侶或是3、5好友來聚會👍","Beer is definitely a feature here!
There are many types. If you do n’t know how to start, ask the clerk to be a good choice, and will screen the ideal beer one by one according to your personal preference!

The meal is a bit more personally. It is recommended to consider ordering meals ~ The taste personally thinks it is pretty good, but the overall is salty (but this is originally benevolent)

The atmosphere is very suitable for couples or 3 or 5 friends to party 👍"
"啤酒選擇多，餐點中上，出餐速度偏慢。
當日最愛炸卡門乳酪！皮薄炸得剛好，不會有油味，佐上巴薩米克醋，絕配！","There are many beer choices, meals are medium, and the meal speed is slow.
Favorite fried Kamen cheese that day!The thin skin is just frying, and there will be no oil smell."
ABV日式居酒屋座落於日本人最愛的中山區，復刻出具有年代氣氛的日式風情難怪人潮總是絡繹不絕,ABV Japanese -style izakaya is located in the Japanese favorite Zhongshan District. It is no wonder that the crowd of Japanese style with the age of the age is always endless.
菜色選擇很多，也有組合餐很方便。可以用餐3小時很棒！這次點的是3-4人分享餐，每道菜都不錯，口味偏重一點點，但很適合下酒，餐廳的整體氛圍很不錯，會推薦朋友去用餐。,"There are many dishes, and it is convenient to have a combination meal.It is great for 3 hours to eat!This time, 3-4 people share meals. Each dish is good, and the taste is a little heavy, but it is very suitable for drinking. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant is very good. I will recommend friends to dine."

There are many types of beer!You can ask the clerk to recommend ️️
Matsusaka pigs like it, but the raw beef has no beef flavor ~ Unfortunately ..."
前菜的評價最好，生牛肉是西式的作法，不是日式燒肉店的作法，和想像不太一樣。吳燒的鐵板不是燙的，有點遺憾。湯品調味尚可，牛腸鍋比較多牛肚，似乎沒有看到肥腸（？）。日本啤酒不少算是有些特色。,"The best evaluation of the former dish is that raw beef is a Western style. It is not the practice of Japanese -style roasted meat shops. It is not the same as imagination.Wu Bing's iron plate is not hot, it is a bit regrettable.The soup is flawed, and there are more beef staples, and it seems that the fat intestines are not seen (?).Many Japanese beer is somewhat unique."

"點了海鮮烏龍麵、炸蝦天婦羅、蕨餅、炸麻糬、南蠻雞，除了炸雞比較普通外外其他每樣味道都讚！味道都跟一般店裡會吃到的不一樣，有加入自己的小巧思（但我不是美食家吃不出來那是什麼😅）
甜點讓人驚艷，雖然大概是因為對居酒屋的甜點沒有太大期待，但真的很好吃啦！蕨餅超Q軟、麻糬也是外酥內嫩！不過天婦羅送上來時已經有點涼掉不像剛炸好的，很可惜，熱的一定更好吃🥺
店員服務態度也不錯，很友善但不會過度熱情，讓人覺得自在（友人喝醉很失控，店員也沒有嫌惡的感覺）。選啤酒很有趣，是像心理測驗一題接一題的二選一，過濾到最後剩下幾個符合你口味的，朋友說很合她的口味。
總之就是一家很用心的店！裝潢也讓人很舒服，只是很好奇為什麼螢幕一直放卓別林的影片？小違和😂這裡都是下班來大聊特聊、放鬆的人，可以非常大聲的講話，很爽！（怕吵的不適合）","Ordered seafood oolong noodles, fried shrimp tempura, fern cakes, fried hemp, southern barbaric chicken.The taste is different from what the average store will eat, there are small ideas that join my own (but I don’t have a gourmet to eat it, what is it?)
The dessert is amazing, although it is probably because of the desserts of izakaya, but it is really delicious!Fern cake super Q soft, mochi is also crispy and tender outside!However, it was a bit cold when the tempura was sent up. It was not as good as it was fried. Unfortunately, the hot is better.
The clerk's service attitude is also good, very friendly but not too enthusiastic, making people feel free (friends are drunk and out of control, and the clerk does not feel disgusting).Choosing beer is very interesting. It is like a two -choice one after the question of psychological testing. It is filtered to the last few of the remaining taste. Friends say that it is very good for her taste.
In short, it is a very careful shop!The decoration is also very comfortable, but I am very curious why the screen has been putting in Chaplin's videos?Xiao Iri and 😂 are all people who have chatted and relaxed from get off work here. They can speak very loudly, very cool!(Afraid of noise)"
"店內有整面的啤酒櫃，視覺上算是有趣。但店內座位安排略為擁擠，桌距過近，室內相當吵雜。雖然店名是日式居酒屋，但算是創作日式料理。味道可能設定上都算下酒菜，所以都偏重卻沒有記憶點。炸起士算是其中還可以的菜品。

類似的店家應該有更好的選擇。","There is a whole beer cabinet in the store, which is visually interesting.However, the seat arrangement in the store is slightly crowded, the table is too close, and the room is quite noisy.Although the name of the store is Japanese -style izakaya, it is considered to be a Japanese cuisine.The taste may be calculated on the wine, so it is heavy but there is no memory point.Fried frying is the dish that can be used.

Similar stores should have a better choice."
第一次來點的食物每一項都超好吃  梅酒（威士忌味）好喝 店員凱凱很友善推薦的餐點跟酒都不錯,Each of the food that comes the first time is super delicious plum wine (whiskey flavor) delicious shop clerk Kai Kai is very friendly and recommended meal and wine
店裡空間不大，食物好吃，酒類選擇超多簡直眼花撩亂，很多從來沒看過的啤酒，可以直接跟店員說喜歡的口味請店員推薦，下班聚餐小酌的好地方！,"The space in the store is not large, the food is delicious, and the wine choices are so much dazzling. Many beer that has never been seen. You can directly tell the shop clerk to ask the store staff to recommend it."
餐點都好好吃，明太子玉子燒超讚，啤酒種類很多，小宸服務很用心認真介紹！！,The meals are delicious.Intersection
"餐點真的很普，鐵板燒類料理油耗味很重……
重點是晚上店員的態度真的讓人不會想再訪
：）","The meal is really universal.
The point is that the attitude of the clerk in the evening really makes people really want to visit again

"東西好吃！服務員熱情
筷子掉了 立馬發現並且遞上 真的太貼心

The chopsticks were discovered immediately and it was really intimate
It is very suitable for three or five friends to meet together for dinner together
There are really many types of wine!IntersectionThe waiter will also introduce it carefully!Push!Intersection"
"店內氣氛很High，非常適合好友相聚。
當晚點了廣島燒與牛肉及湯品，味道都還可以。可惜是居酒屋，但梅酒、清酒的選擇很少，只有各式各樣的啤酒（啤酒控天堂），所以我們都只有喝一杯而已~
（還有！音樂風格不統一，聽覺很不舒適放鬆~）","The atmosphere in the store is very high, and it is very suitable for friends to get together.
That night, I ordered Hiroshima roasted and beef and soup, and the taste was okay.Unfortunately, Izakaya, but there are few choices for plum wine and sake. There are only a variety of beer (beer control paradise), so we only have a drink ~
(Also! The music style is not uniform, the hearing is uncomfortable and relaxed ~)"
餐點份量很大，但不精緻，雞肉串很柴，口味也是偏重，配酒當下酒菜還可以，但絕對不會再訪。,"The meal is very large, but it is not delicate. The chicken skewers are very firewood, and the taste is also heavy. The current wine and vegetables are okay, but it will never visit again."
"創意日式料理，門司燒很好吃。
啤酒選擇多元，適合與朋友小聚。
開放式廚房，能看到廚房內乾淨整潔，廚師們料理俐落。","Creative Japanese cuisine, Moji is delicious.
Beer selection is diverse, suitable for gathering with friends.
Open kitchen, you can see the clean and tidy kitchen, and the chefs are neatly cooking."
店裡啤酒種類很充足，氣氛出色、服務快速。前菜類例如たたき表現出色，但生牛肉卻是歐洲作法，上整片拌洋蔥淋醋醬，比較可惜。鍋類中規中矩。服務員專業友善，食物三星啤酒四星，五星是加給幫忙拍照還要認真拍到完美的服務員小姐姐。,"The type of beer in the store is sufficient, the atmosphere is excellent, and the service is fast.The pre -dish is excellent, but the raw beef is a European method. It is a pity that it is a pity that mixing onions and vinegar sauce.The pot is quite satisfactory.The waiter is professional and friendly, the food Samsung Beer is four stars, and the five -star is for help to take pictures and take the perfect waiter younger sister."
"誤打誤撞的進來，不小心被圈粉了！
今天點的每一道餐點都很好吃，玉子燒不只是玉子燒，炸薯條也不只是炸薯條，到底是什麼？來點就知道了啦！

酒類選擇延續ABV餐廳系列的多樣化，想喝什麼樣的口味都有。和其他分店比較不一樣的是這裡座位比較少，可以想像未來一位難求的狀況了。

裝潢氣氛好、食物很好吃、酒也好喝、店員很親切，不來可惜～～","Come in by mistake and accidentally being circled!
Every meal ordered today is very delicious. Yuzi burned is not just Yuzi burned, but also French fries are not just fries. What is it?Just know it!

啤酒總類很多， 豆腐沙拉很大盤， 金針菇牛肉捲烤的恰到好處， 適合聚會喝一杯的好地方！,"There are many total beer categories. The tofu salad is very large, and the enoki mushrooms are grilled just right. It is suitable for a good place for a party to drink a cup!"
明太子大阪燒味道蠻好，雞軟骨也味道蠻不錯，烤中卷表現一般，不算難吃，服務人員態度很好，整體環境不錯，疫情關係就外帶，現場有超多不同口味跟牌子的精釀啤酒，適合朋友聚餐,"The Ming Prince Osaka has a good flavor, and the chondrocytes also taste pretty good. The roasted rolls are average. It is not unpalatable. The service staff attitude is very good. The overall environment is good. Cast beer, suitable for friends to dinner"
餐點好吃，服務員會依各人喜好推薦適合的酒類，推薦的也都很適，厲害唷!!!,"The meal is delicious, the waiter will recommend suitable alcohol according to the preferences of each person, and the recommended is also very suitable, amazing !!!"
日式餐點搭配各式啤酒 服務生讓你知道適合喝什麼樣的酒 環境氣氛也很適合聚餐 生日聚餐會再回訪,Japanese -style meals with all kinds of beer waiters let you know what kind of wine environment is suitable for drinking and environmental atmosphere is also suitable for dinner birthday dinner together
雖然店名叫日式居酒屋，但店內的氛圍其實沒有很日式，食物中規中矩，啤酒類選擇非常多，價位略高。,"Although the store is called Japanese -style izakaya, the atmosphere in the store is actually not very Japanese. Food is quite satisfactory. There are many beer choices and a slight price."
"距離上一次吃已經有一年多了，整體的用餐口味沒有上一次好。

-餐點
海膽醬炒海鮮烏龍：整體烏龍麵是好吃的，但是海膽醬在口味上是無感的。
卡哩卡哩雞軟骨：這道菜非常下酒，值得一推的菜色。
蔥鹽雞肉串：蔥鹽的部分過鹹，吃的時候要撥掉一半再吃。
照燒鐵板雞頸肉：雞頸肉是好吃的，不過底部都是醬料，吃到後面一樣太鹹，後面都把料夾到另一盤先滴完再吃。
博多牛腸鍋：吃過六花舍牛腸鍋對比後，這鍋跟牛腸鍋完全沒有關係。
啤酒：啤酒種類很多，單看自己喜歡的類型，自己依照喜好請店員推薦都算好喝。","It has been more than a year since the last time I eat, and the overall meal taste is not good.

-On meal
Sealated sauce fried seafood oolong: The overall oolong noodles are delicious, but sea urchin sauce is indifferent in taste.
Kali Kali Chicken Bone: This dish is very wine, which is worth pushing dishes.
Stewed chicken skewers: The part of the onion and salt is too salty. When you eat it, you should get half of it before eating.
Zhaosi iron plate chicken neck: Chicken neck is delicious, but the bottom is all sauces. It is too salty at the back, and the folder is dripped in the other plate before eating.
Hakata beef intestinal pot: After eating Liuhuaju's beef intestinal pot, this pot has nothing to do with the beef intestine pot.
Beer: There are many types of beer. Just look at your favorite type, and ask the clerk to recommend it according to your preferences."

1. 食物

態度超差 服務人員每個都像你欠他幾百萬 尤其是男服務生 而且還說謊 說客人有先指定座位 我們詢問客人 根本沒有 最基本的禮儀都沒有,"The attitude is overworked. Each of the service staff is like you owe him millions of million, especially for male waiters, and also lie that the guests have the first designated seat. We ask the guests to have no basic etiquette at all."

"更新：我們和我們三個人再次來到這裡。這次我們訂了一張更大的桌子，點了3~4人的套餐。我們幾乎清理了所有的盤子，食物非常美味！強烈建議訂購這套套餐，或按照我們的照片點菜。這些是最好的！

這家酒屋🏮是ABV連鎖餐廳旗下的，混合了一點美式啤酒🍺酒吧風格！這家酒屋就位於中山區一家五星級飯店的對面。我來過這裡很多次了，從來沒有弄錯過他們的簽名！","Update: We and the three of us come here again.This time we ordered a larger table and ordered a set of 3 to 4 people.We cleaned up almost all the plates, and the food was very delicious!It is strongly recommended to order this set of meals, or follow our photos.These are the best!

【如果你想毀了你的台灣之旅，一定要來的地方😇】

結束我們為期三天的台灣之旅
這是對這個地方的一次愉快的訪問。

在台灣的三天回憶是那麼的友善和美好
它徹底崩潰了。

1.有史以來最糟糕的啤酒
服務生推薦的四種啤酒都是最難喝的。
很美味。陰溝的味道、腐爛的味道、自來水的酸味、甜到血糖飆升的味道… 😇我認為這可能是建議旅行者處理未售出的庫存。

2.最差的服務
所有員工都不友好，不工作，只是看智慧型手機或互相聊天。
當我問問題的時候，我只是敷衍地回答，好像很煩。尤其是那個帶著耳環和刺青的女人… 。我從來沒有在任何國家見過如此不友善的人...

3.有史以來最糟糕的菜
我是在看到評論說禦好燒很好吃後才來的。
麵團未煮熟且無味。當我問麵團熟了沒有的時候，我就問廚房說熟了，他們用奇怪的眼神看著我… 。哈哈，我的同伴們都因為食物太難吃了而離開了，上菜後不到5分鐘就離開了。

我很滿意因為每個人都很友好

參觀這個地方後，事情發生了最糟糕的轉變。

30 分鐘內我就在街上丟掉了 50 美元。
絕對不推薦給旅行者。

[If you want to destroy your trip to Taiwan, the place you must come 😇]

End our three -day trip to Taiwan
This is a pleasant visit to this place.

The three -day memory in Taiwan is so friendly and beautiful
It collapsed completely.

1. The worst beer ever has history
The four beer recommended by the waiter are the most difficult to drink.
It was delicious.The taste of the gutter, the taste of rotten, the sour taste of the tap water, the sweetness of the soaring blood sugar ... 😇 I think this may be a proposed traveler to deal with the unprecedented inventory.

2. The worst service
All employees are not friendly and do not work, just look at smart phones or chat with each other.
When I asked the question, I just answered perfunctoryly, as if I was annoying.Especially the woman with earrings and tattoos ...I have never seen such an unfriendly person in any country ...

3. The worst dish ever ever in history
I saw the comments and said that Yao Hao burned was delicious and delicious.
The dough is not cooked and tasteless.When I asked if the dough was familiar, I asked the kitchen to be familiar, and they looked at me with strange eyes ...Haha, my companions left because the food was too difficult, and left less than 5 minutes after serving.

I'm very satisfied because everyone is friendly
Photos of travel to Taiwan
After visiting this place, things have changed the worst.

In 30 minutes, I lost $ 50 on the street.
It is definitely not recommended to travelers.
If you want to destroy your trip, please visit!"
可以品嚐到世界各地啤酒的人氣啤酒餐廳。台北有很多家ABV，但這家的主題是日式料理。您可以告訴工作人員您的啤酒喜好，然後讓他們為您選擇的風格。玻璃杯的變化取決於您選擇的啤酒的類型和大小。這次我們先喝的是我平常不喝的德國黑啤酒。它與油炸和燒烤食物完美搭配。和生魚片的搭配果然符合預期😅所有的菜都很美味。價格合理，CP平衡也不錯。我週末去的時候，一半以上的顧客都是女性，所以氣氛很好。也推薦用於約會。 …,"You can taste the popular beer restaurant around the world.There are many ABVs in Taipei, but this theme is Japanese cuisine.You can tell the staff your beer preferences and then let them choose the style for you.The change of the glass depends on the type and size of the beer you choose.This time we drink the German black beer that I usually don't drink.It is perfectly matched with fried and grilled food.The combination of raw fish slices really meets the expected 😅 All the dishes are delicious.The price is reasonable and the CP balance is also good.When I went on the weekend, more than half of the customers were women, so the atmosphere was good.It is also recommended for dating.Mowing"
"來自世界各地的啤酒幾乎令人難以置信的選擇。
只有韓國啤酒可疑失蹤。
除了種類繁多的日本酒吧食品外，這裡也是與朋友聚會的好消遣。","Beer from all over the world is almost incredible.
Only South Korean beer disappeared.
In addition to the many types of Japanese bar foods, this is also a good pastime here."
我進的第二家店。食物是日本居酒屋風格。我以為有生啤酒，結果全是瓶裝啤酒。瓶裝啤酒種類繁多，選擇起來有點困難。,"I entered the second store.Food is the style of Kyoko Izaka in Japan.I thought there was a raw beer, and the result was bottle beer.There are many types of bottle beer, and it is a bit difficult to choose."
食物和日本精釀啤酒的選擇非常豐富，「居酒屋」氛圍很好，工作人員也非常樂於助人。非常感謝您靈活地為我們預訂餐桌，我們對今晚的一切感到非常滿意。強烈推薦:),"The choice of food and Japanese craft beer is very rich. The atmosphere of the ""izakaya"" is very good, and the staff is also very helpful.Thank you very much for booked a dining table for us flexibly. We are very satisfied with everything tonight.Strong recommendation :)"
"美味的食物有許多不同的烹飪收據。  種類繁多的啤酒選擇令人驚嘆。  氣氛非常好。  放鬆心情，享受美麗的夜晚。

絕對強烈推薦。","There are many different cooking receipts for delicious food.A variety of beer choices are amazing.The atmosphere is very good.Relax and enjoy a beautiful night.

Absolutely highly recommended."
這家居酒屋的食物很美味。我們有 5 個人來吃早餐，所以餐廳沒有滿員。我們的服務生對菜單不是很了解。倒啤酒的傢伙不知道該怎麼做！也許更好地培訓你的服務員和飲料服務員！,"The food of this house izakaya is delicious.We have 5 people to eat breakfast, so the restaurant is not full.Our waiters do not know the menu very well.The guy who pour beer does not know what to do!Maybe better training your waiters and beverage waiters!"
2 道菜 2 軟性飲料 $80 新幣加。環境不錯。推薦下班後和朋友一起放鬆。不過沒那麼便宜。,2 dishes 2 soft drinks $ 80.The environment is good.Recommend to relax with friends after get off work.But not so cheap.
"這家商店位於麗晶酒店的正後方。我們有來自世界各地的多種啤酒可供選擇。您可以從牆上的啤酒中選擇您最喜歡的啤酒。不幸的是，我在選擇時並不知道價格。
主菜是禦好燒，但這次我沒有點。龍蝦沾薯條是一種不常見的沾醬，但和馬鈴薯拌在一起就很美味了。與啤酒很相配的小吃。
我選擇了蔥鹽作為烤雞肉串，這是一個不錯的選擇！很美味。我很高興大塊的肉吃起來很滿足。","This store is located behind the Lichen Hotel.We have a variety of beer from all over the world to choose from.You can choose your favorite beer from the beer on the wall.Unfortunately, I don't know the price when I choose.
The main dish is roasting, but this time I didn't order it.Lobster stains are a kind of uncommon dipping sauce, but mixing with potato is delicious.Snacks that match beer.
I chose onion salt as a grilled chicken skewers, this is a good choice!It was delicious.I am very happy to eat big pieces of meat."
環境不錯。絕對是一家非常適合與朋友和客人一起用餐的餐廳。還有大量的進口啤酒可供選擇；毫無疑問，來這裡是為了喝啤酒和吃清淡的食物。我認為這裡的目標是美食。,The environment is good.It is definitely a restaurant that is very suitable for dining with friends and guests.There are also a large number of imported beer to choose from; there is no doubt that here is to drink beer and eat light food.I think the goal here is food.
我發現這家酒吧是因為晚上很想吃禦好燒，而且愛上了它，所以我每週都會去那裡，就像世界啤酒店一樣，裡面有很多我以前沒有見過的啤酒，而且幾乎都是。然而，他們好心地推薦了它，而且他們推薦的所有飲料都很美味！這裡的御好燒很好吃，炸的也很好吃，沒有什麼不好吃的。 ❣️週末人很多，可以提前預約或9點以後去吃！,"I found that this bar is because I want to eat Royal Hao Ying at night, and I fall in love with it, so I go there every week, just like the World Beer Hotel. There are many beer I have never seen before, and almost all of them have been. yes.However, they carefully recommended it, and all the drinks they recommend are delicious!The royal burning here is delicious, and the fried is also delicious. There is nothing bad.可以️ There are a lot of people on the weekend, you can make an appointment in advance or go to eat after 9 o'clock!"
桌上型日式居酒屋（酒吧）和精釀啤酒廳的結合體，非常獨特。這裡有 100 多種不同類型的瓶裝酒供您選擇，絕對讓顧客眼花撩亂。然而，食物份量相對較大，適合分享。因此，對於我的單獨訪問，我只能嘗試幾道菜。,"The combination of the Japanese -style Japanese -style izakaya (bar) and the craft beer house is very unique.Here are more than 100 different types of bottled wines for you to choose from, which will definitely make customers dazzling.However, the amount of food is relatively large, suitable for sharing.Therefore, for my separate visit, I can only try a few dishes."
"非常粗魯的工作人員。
沒有正確打招呼或接受訂單。我們很粗魯和不屑一顧，甚至在給食物時什麼也沒說，只是把它倒在桌子上。
然後收取服務費。
就因為我是韓國人嗎？

不建議 - 而且食物太貴了。","Very rude staff.
No correct greetings or receiving orders.We were rude and disdain, and even said nothing when we gave food, just poured it on the table.
Then charge the service fee.
Is it because I am Korean?

Not recommended -and food is too expensive."
就在麗晶酒店旁邊，有一天晚上我們想吃烤雞肉串時就在那裡。我們點了禦好燒和一些串（只有大約 5 或 6 種），但已經足夠好了。我們還點了清酒蛤湯，這是迄今為止我見過的最好的。燈光有點太暗了，當我們吃完飯時我們感到很累。總的來說，優質的食物適合一頓快餐。,"Just next to Licheng Hotel, one night we are there when we want to eat roast chicken skewers.We ordered some skewers (only about 5 or 6 types), but it was good enough.We also ordered the wine clam soup. This is the best I have seen so far.The lights were a bit dark, and we felt tired when we finished eating.In general, high -quality food is suitable for a fast food."
"正在尋找一家精釀啤酒吧，發現了這個地方，我們最終在那裡喝了清酒。

有很多精釀啤酒和食物可供選擇，但這次沒有嘗試。

服務很好，很有禮貌","We were looking for a craft beer bar and found this place, and we finally drank sake there.

There are many craft beer and food to choose from, but this time I did not try.

The service is very good, very polite"
好吃又好喝的地方。,A delicious and delicious place.
如果你住在麗晶飯店，我建議順便嚐嚐來自世界各地的啤酒、五花肉？食物出來得很晚，但很美味。,"If you live in Licheng Hotel, I suggest you try beer and pork belly from all over the world?The food came out late, but it was delicious."
酒吧和餐廳的完美結合，可以吃美味的亞洲美食，喝最好的啤酒。他們甚至還提供了 Westvleteren 12 種世界上最好的啤酒，非常特別。,"The perfect combination of bar and restaurant can eat delicious Asian food and drink the best beer.They even provided 12 best beer in WestvLeteren, which is very special."
不錯的融合食物，有點貴…6個人結果是7500nt包括酒水。環境太熱了。 太太熱了！,"Good fusion food, a bit expensive ... The results of the 6 people are 7500NT including wine.The environment is too hot.The wife is hot!"
多種進口和本地啤酒的選擇，與啤酒搭配的美味食物，友善的員工，輕鬆的用餐和飲酒氛圍，位於台北市的便利交通位置,"The choice of various imports and local beer, delicious food with beer, friendly employees, easy meal and drinking atmosphere, located in Taipei City's convenient transportation location"
環境很好，進口啤酒種類多元化，只是太早打烊，建議可以到凌晨2~3點！ ！,"The environment is very good. The types of imported beer are diversified, but it is too early to snooze. It is recommended to be 2 to 3 am!Intersection"
我們之前在另一家ABV餐廳（光復南路店）有過很好的體驗，所以決定在3月1日嘗試這家。但結果卻令人失望！食物很一般但不是很好。讓我們的用餐體驗不愉快的是服務，尤其是推薦啤酒選擇的服務——她既不專業也不友好。還看到地板上有一隻死蟑螂🙄不會再回來了！ …,"We had a good experience in another ABV restaurant (Guangfu South Road) before, so I decided to try this one on March 1.But the result is disappointing!Food is average but not very good.What makes our dining experience unpleasant is service, especially the service of recommending beer selection -she is neither professional nor friendly.I also saw that there was a dead cockroach on the floor and would not come back again!Mowing"
"如果您喜歡啤酒，那麼這裡就是您該去的地方。這裡有多種啤酒可供選擇，如果您想討論我們對啤酒的了解，您可以盡可能地與工作人員愉快地聊天。
您也可以嘗試將啤酒和食物搭配，因為有許多食物和啤酒可供搭配。
食物方面，我吃了非常美味的東西，我很喜歡，像是腸子、不同風格的御好燒、煙燻生魚片或龍蝦醬煎炸。嗯，有很多東西值得探索！","If you like beer, then here is where you should go.There are a variety of beer to choose from. If you want to discuss our understanding of beer, you can chat with staff as much as possible.
You can also try to match beer and food, because there are many foods and beer to match.
In terms of food, I have eaten very delicious things. I like it very much, such as the intestines, different styles of royal burning, smoky sashimi or lobster sauce.Well, there are many things worth exploring!"
不是 ABV 系列中最好的之一。日式和西式混合的食物和設計風格，有點奇怪。與所有 ABV 系列一樣，有多種啤酒、蘋果酒和 IPA 可供選擇和享用。不過有點貴。,"Not one of the best in the ABV series.Japanese -style and Western mixed food and design styles are a bit strange.Like all ABV series, there are a variety of beer, apple wine and IPA to choose from.But it's a bit expensive."
"除啤酒ok, 其它菜色不ok.","Except beer OK, other dishes are not OK."
名古屋手羽先好吃,Nagoya chicken wings
好吃好喝好地方❤️,"It's delicious, delicious, good place ❤️"
沒有啤酒價格指示。從食品品質和數量來看，性價比略低於平均值。工作人員很有禮貌。,"No beer price instructions.From the perspective of food quality and quantity, the cost performance is slightly lower than the average.The staff is very polite."
酒吧氛圍涼爽，裝飾精美，提供日本料理和各國啤酒（四個冰箱裡裝滿了不同的啤酒🍺！！）服務很棒，價格合理，但絕對值得。,"The atmosphere of the bar is cool and exquisitely decorated. It provides Japanese cuisine and beer in various countries (four refrigerators are filled with different beer crickets !!!) The service is great, the price is reasonable, but it is definitely worth it."
一開始我很滿意，因為有很多世界品牌的啤酒，食物也一般，但啤酒杯的狀況不好（接觸嘴巴的部分有一張貼紙），工作人員的服務也不一樣。最後店家算錯了，我就回去跟他們談了回來，但後來發現他們還少退了服務費。和啤酒大師一樣，推薦啤酒的工作人員也很友好，我住得很愉快，所以我試著將其視為溝通錯誤，而不是歧視遊客。我們需要更加努力才能長期保持熱點。,"At first I was very satisfied, because there were many world brands of beer, and the food was average, but the condition of the beer glass was not good (there was a sticker in the mouth of the mouth), and the staff's service was different.In the end, the shop was wrong, so I went back to talk to them, but later found that they had less withdrawal of service fees.Like the beer master, the staff who recommend beer are also very friendly. I live happily, so I try to see it as a communication error, not discriminating against tourists.We need to work harder to maintain hot spots for a long time."
整體來說，CP值很低。食物和服務都很平庸。啤酒的選擇範圍很廣，但價格非常高（點餐時沒有註明）。,"On the whole, the CP value is very low.Food and services are mediocre.The scope of beer has a wide range of choices, but the price is very high (not indicated at the time of ordering)."
最好提前預訂，以確保您可以隨時享用啤酒。,It is best to book in advance to ensure that you can enjoy beer at any time.
氣氛很好，適合與朋友聚會。  有多種瓶裝/罐裝精釀啤酒可供選擇，但價格不高。  食物也不錯。,"The atmosphere is very good, suitable for meeting with friends.There are a variety of bottles/cans to choose from, but the price is not high.Food is also good."
"非常獨特的日本料理風格。
雖然不是粉絲，但氣氛還是不錯的。","Very unique Japanese cuisine style.
Although not a fan, the atmosphere is still good."
如果你喜歡精釀啤酒，強烈推薦這個地方。他們有來自世界各地的多種不同啤酒可供選擇。食物很好而且價格合理。菜單上有很多菜色。工作人員熱情友善。地方不是很大，所以一定要提前打電話預約。,"If you like craft beer, highly recommend this place.They have a variety of different beer from all over the world to choose from.The food is very good and the price is reasonable.There are many dishes on the menu.The staff is enthusiastic and friendly.The place is not very large, so be sure to call in advance to make an appointment."
"有各種啤酒，小吃也非常好吃。
金針菇牛肉捲和禦好燒ㅠ","There are all kinds of beer, and the snacks are very delicious.
Rounded mushrooms and beef rolls and royal roasted ㅠ"
合理的食物。品嚐來自不同國家的精釀啤酒的好地方，包括一些有趣的台灣啤酒！當詢問啤酒推薦時，那裡的人很樂於助人！我喝了一杯果味朦朧的 IPA、一杯來自台灣的非常有趣的蜂蜜啤酒和一杯來自日本的抹茶啤酒。,"Reasonable food.Taste the good places of craft beer from different countries, including some interesting Taiwanese beer!When asking beer recommendations, the people there are very helpful!I drank a cup of fruity IPA, a cup of very interesting honey beer from Taiwan, and a cup of matcha beer from Japan."
不錯的日式食物。  如果你喜歡德國小麥啤酒，那就自己窮吧...,"Good Japanese food.If you like German wheat beer, then you are poor ..."
很好吃,Delicious
"啤酒，來自各地的各種啤酒的許多啤酒
比利時、德國、京都、山口，酒精不過是酒類的醉酒。","Beer, many beer from various beer from various places
Belgium, Germany, Kyoto, Yamaguchi, alcohol is just drunk."
好吃💯,Delicious
"對於居住或訪問台北的任何人來說，這是一個必須體驗的體驗！

ABV 擁有來自世界各地的大量啤酒可供選擇。關注台灣當地的精釀啤酒－世界一流！
他們的食物菜單建議每餐搭配不同的啤酒。非常周到。
食物棒極了。將花費我幾頁來描述。嚐嚐他們的生牛肉片！
服務無可挑剔，工作人員周到有禮貌","This is an experience that must be experienced for anyone living or visiting Taipei!

ABV has a large number of beer from all over the world to choose from.Follow the local craft beer in Taiwan -world -class!
Their food menu is recommended for each meal with different beer.Very thoughtful.
The food is great.Take a few pages of me to describe it.Taste their raw beef slices!
The service is impeccable, and the staff is thoughtful and polite"
我沒有嘗試這裡的食物，但喝了幾杯飲料後我肯定會回來的。座位有點緊張，但這個地方很舒適，佈置時尚。工作人員很友好，樂於助人。這是一個放鬆身心並品嚐來自世界各地的進口啤酒和當地啤酒的好地方。,"I didn't try the food here, but I will definitely come back after drinking a few drinks.The seat is a bit tense, but this place is comfortable and fashionable.The staff is very friendly and helpful.This is a good place to relax and taste imported beer and local beer from all over the world."
喜歡他們的啤酒，食物也很好吃,"I like their beer, and the food is also delicious"
"不錯的酒吧，但價格卻是來自另一個世界。
我們每人花了大約2000新台幣，吃了一些不正宗的日式燒烤和每人2-3小瓶啤酒。服務生會向你推薦啤酒，但沒有提及任何價格。後來我們也很震驚，每小瓶啤酒要花10美元左右。

對我來說這是第一次也是最後一次。","A good bar, but the price is from another world.
Each of us spends about NT $ 2,000, and we have eaten some unknown Japanese barbecue and 2-3 small bottle of beer per person.The waiter will recommend beer to you, but does not mention any price.Later, we were also shocked. Each small bottle of beer spent about $ 10.

This is the first and last time for me."
"連日本人都會滿意的台灣人經營的日式居酒屋。這是同品牌餐廳的日式版本，台北約有四家餐廳，包括西班牙菜和美式菜。裡面的氣氛更像是英式酒吧，完全沒有居酒屋的感覺，但是菜單都是日式居酒屋風格。鐵板燒、生魚片、烤雞肉串、咖哩、沙拉、油炸食品等。

即使對於日本人來說，味道也同樣美味。在正常範圍內。咖哩燉肌肉特別美味，和起司很搭。許多台灣餐廳經營的日式居酒屋的味道和日本餐廳經營的相差很大，但這家還是比較過癮的。","Even Japanese -style izakaya run by Taiwanese that Japanese people will be satisfied.This is the Japanese version of the same brand restaurant. There are about four restaurants in Taipei, including Spain and American dishes.The atmosphere inside is more like an British bar. There is no feeling of izakaya at all, but the menu is all Japanese -style izakaya style.Boiler, sashimi, grilled chicken skewers, curry, salad, fried food, etc.

Even for the Japanese, the taste is equally delicious.In the normal range.Curry stewing muscles are particularly delicious and matched with cheese.The taste of Japanese -style izakaya operated by many restaurants in Taiwan is very different from that of Japanese restaurants, but this one is more enjoyable."
美味的食物和優質的服務以及啤酒的推薦,Delicious food and high -quality services and beer recommendations
蜜蜂愛好者的地方。我最喜歡炒麵和麻糬！,Place of bee enthusiasts.I like fried noodles the most!

乾淨且彩色多元,Clean and colorful
酒款多，餐點好吃。,"There are many wines, and the meals are delicious."
這是台灣人的店，日本人禁止入內。老實說，味道很難，因為是台灣製造的。真的，這是不可能的。我還有很多話想說，但我就停下來吧。如此一來，不如戒掉為好。單價高！,"This is a Taiwanese shop, and the Japanese are prohibited from entering.Honestly, it tastes difficult because it was made in Taiwan.Really, this is impossible.I still have a lot of words to say, but I stop.In this way, it is better to quit.The unit price is high!"
老實說，這裡的食物很一般，不是很好吃，但啤酒很棒，他們提供多種啤酒可供選擇。,"Honestly, the food here is very average, not delicious, but beer is great, they provide a variety of beer to choose from."
