"採用全預約制的清酒吧，裡面的清酒藏酒非常豐富，有很多外面比較難見的清酒可以飲用。

另外清酒的價格也非常實在，建議喜歡清酒的朋友過來一趟。來之前記得提前在FB預約，不然有可能無法進店享用回味無窮的清酒。","The bartending bar, which is made of full appointment, is very rich in sake and collection inside, and there are many difficult sake to drink outside.

In addition, the price of sake is also very real. It is recommended that friends who like sake to come over.Remember to make an appointment in FB in advance before you come, otherwise you may not be able to enter the store to enjoy the endless sake."
食物好吃！清酒選擇多！一定要訂位才進得來,The food is delicious!There are so many sake!Be sure to order to enter
這兒好棒！優質！餐點美味！清酒好有品質！老闆很會介紹！,It's great here!high quality!Meal delicious!Sake is so quality!The boss will introduce it!
第一次接觸到日本酒，吧主細心的介紹每一杯Sake 風味、酒造、產地，特別的是這裡不是日料是台菜，吧主搭配的菜和每杯酒都非常的match ! 位置不多吧主很親切的照顧每位客人感受、店內也不太會有大聲喧嘩的情況，好適合約會☺️,"For the first time when I came into contact with Japanese wine, the Lord carefully introduced each cup of Sake flavor, wine, and place of origin. In particular, it is not Japanese food or Taiwanese dish. The Lord is very kind to take care of each guest's feelings, and there will be no loud noise in the store, so suitable for dating ☺️"
"有十四代酒未來單杯點60ml twd 650，價錢也不貴，第一次喝，值得一試，很香甜，濃厚，綿長，餘韻停留很久～

我先點了一杯十四代，然後店員推薦我吃淡菜twd 750，我問他十四代還是單喝比較合適，我先點其他酒？他說這個酒配淡菜也可以，我也不是專業的，那就就聽他建議，um⋯單喝比較好，配吃被搶了風頭浪費了，感覺十四代要慢慢細緻品嚐。淡菜=青口，挺新鮮肥大甜美，但我會寧願多點一兩杯酒

另外點了date seven twd 600（好像是），豬耳朵twd 210，豬耳朵也是他們推薦，一直問我夠不夠吃😂，我也就點來試一下，一開始是挺有口感，吃多了挺肥膩跟挺咸，然後我問他們要一杯水想清除口腔的味道，他們說只有付費瓶裝有氣水😂，餐廳沒提供普通水我是覺得有點荒謬，我要清除口腔的食物味道再喝酒，就要買水，不買水那你就用清酒漱口吧😂，最後我就用我的date seven來漱口吃豬耳朵了😂，我一個人沒必要開720ml的有氣水😂

建議先吃東西再來單純喝酒，食物不錯吃不過偏貴，氣氛環境是可以的，漂亮的，但是整體真的有點令人失望，我從很久以前就bookmark了這家店，感覺就是浪費了那杯十四代，還有被硬推下酒菜也是滿尷尬的，我一個女生他們叫我點三個菜再加一大瓶應該720ml的有氣水（但被我拒絕了，我吃不了那麼多，然後職員就跟他們的朋友或老顧客一直聊天😂），雖然我是說沒有吃飯過來，但三個菜也太明顯很想做生意很硬銷吧😂，還有他半酒半餐廳形式連杯普通水都沒有，這個點我也是奇怪","There are fourteen generations of wine in the future single cup 60ml TWD 650, and the price is not expensive. For the first time, it is worth trying. It is very sweet, strong, long, and the rest of the rhyme stays for a long time ~

I ordered a cup of fourteen generations first, and then the clerk recommended me to eat TWD 750. I asked him that the fourteen generation was more suitable for drinking. I ordered other wine first?He said that this wine is also okay with light vegetables, and I am not professional, so I listen to his suggestions. UM ⋯ is better to drink, and it ’s a waste of being snatched with the ethics. I feel that the fourteen generations should slowly taste it.Light vegetables = Qingkou, it's very fresh and sweet, but I would rather be more or two more glasses of wine

In addition, I ordered Date Seven TWD 600 (seemingly), pig ear TWD 210, and pig ears are also recommended. I always asked me if I was enough to eat. I just click on it. I was fat and salty, and then I asked them to want a glass of water to remove the taste of the mouth. They said that only paid bottles were loaded with gas water, and the restaurant did not provide ordinary water. I feel a bit ridiculous. I want to remove the food of the mouth. Just buy water, do n’t buy water, then use sake to rinse your mouth. In the end, I used my date seven to rush my mouth to eat pig ears.

It is recommended to eat first and then drink. The food is good but it is too expensive. The atmosphere environment is okay and beautiful, but the overall is really a bit disappointing. I have been Bookmark this shop a long time ago. The fourteenth generation, and it is also embarrassing to be pushed hard. A girl, who I told me to order three dishes, and a large bottle should be 720ml. The employee has been chatting with their friends or old customers.) Although I said that I didn't eat, the three dishes were too obvious that I wanted to do business. There is no water, I am also strange to this point"
"今晚的酒都是老闆推薦的
每一杯我都喜歡
食物也是每一道都好吃
好吃到忘記拍照😅

炸豬耳朵請務必要點
很好吃！不油膩！口感Q有膠質感

很適合週五跟朋友小酌放鬆的地方","Tonight's wine is recommended by the boss
I like every glass
Food is also delicious
It's so delicious than forgetting to take pictures 忘

Please be sure to point the fried pig ear
Very delicious!Not greasy!Taste Q has glue texture

It is very suitable for relaxation with friends on Friday"
有個性氣氛的日式清酒Bar，適合幾位朋友來聊聊天。,Japanese -style sake BAR with a personality atmosphere is suitable for several friends to chat.
"老闆正哥非常專業，而且健談
也會認真回答客人的問題，是我心目中享受品酒氛圍的第一名單杯日本酒吧！！
還常常會跟各式各樣的達人們舉辦聯名或是客座活動是值得一推再推的好店！","The boss Zheng is very professional and talkative
I will also answer the question of guests seriously. It is the first list of the wine tasting atmosphere in my mind!Intersection
It is also often a good shop that is worth pushing again with a variety of experts or guest activities!"
"千萬記得預約，否則就鐵條乾看😂
第一次隨意去不知道要預約
當時是一位顏值不錯的小哥哥告訴
我們就覺得帥就安心離去

氛圍很好的店像外國只有十來位子
我不大喝清酒但在推薦下
真的喝到了奔放不辣且通體的酒

比個愛心💗只是剛好","Remember to make an appointment, otherwise you will look at the iron bar.
I don't know if I want to make an appointment for the first time
At that time, a little brother with good value told
We feel handsome and leave with peace of mind

The shop with good atmosphere is like a ten positions in foreign countries
I don't drink sake but I am recommended
I really drink it, unrestrained and decent wine

It's just right than a love 💗"
"店內氛圍滿分！主事者品味很好，光線亮度、香氛、桌椅觸感、食器、杯盅、筷托……件件都用心！
餐點自製比例很高，重視食材鮮度，這也是只做預約客才能達到的物料管理！
酒類無疑是此間的重點，選酒很有意思，並且也不光是清酒，香檳、日本葡萄酒~~都很有一些入手困難的品項。
交由店主pairing，可以有個人經驗值之外的新體驗，推薦！","The atmosphere in the store is full!The master has a good taste, light brightness, fragrance, tables and chairs touch, food, cups, chopsticks, etc.
The proportion of meals is very high, and the freshness of the ingredients attaches importance to the material management that can only be achieved by reserved!
The wine is undoubtedly the focus of this time. Choosing wine is very interesting, and not only sake, champagne, Japanese wine ~~ There are some difficult items that have difficulty in starting.
Make it to the owner Pairing, you can have a new experience beyond personal experience, recommend!"
店家很會選酒。氣氛好,The store can choose wine.Good atmosphere
氣氛舒適餐點也好吃，老闆很細心會依照餐點替客人安排適合的清酒品項，再搭配上老闆專業講解，整體就是一個味蕾旅程～,"The atmosphere comfortable meal is also delicious. The boss is very careful to arrange suitable sake items for the guests according to the meal, and then match the professional explanation of the boss. The overall is a taste bud."
清酒選擇讚 ，礦泉水也很講究。服務ok可惜食物方面就。。。上菜也誇張的慢，清蒸魚花2小時才上，魚肉煮得過熟，硬，還有魚鱗，味道。。。我們還是第一座，建議換掉廚師,"Selecting sake, mineral water is also very particular.It is unfortunately serving food.EssenceEssenceThe food is also exaggerated slowly. Steamed fish flowers for 2 hours. The fish is cooked, hard, and fish scales.EssenceEssenceWe are still the first, it is recommended to replace the chef"
很舒壓的酒吧，店長友善有趣，值得經常去走走，可能會遇到不同的特殊清酒！,"A very comfortable bar, the manager is friendly and interesting, it is worth walking around, and you may encounter different special sake!"
裝潢精美、氛圍非常的棒，提供惠比壽生啤、老闆嚴選日本地酒與葡萄酒跟超好吃的下酒菜，加上老闆對酒類的知識，非常推薦。,"The decoration is exquisite and the atmosphere is great. It provides Huibing Beer, the boss strictly selected Japanese wine and wine and super delicious wine, and the boss's knowledge of wine is very recommended."
"要預約才能吃，朋友帶我來
炸豬皮好吃，日本酒好喝
滿有味道的店，可惜不能walkin","I have to make an appointment to eat, and my friend takes me to come
Fried pork skin is delicious, Japanese wine is delicious
A store full of taste, but unfortunately you can’t be WALKIN"
每次餐點都不同非常美味😋酒類都是外面買不到的品項。,"Each meal is different, very delicious."
第一次遇到小酒大門敞開，半開放式環境。天氣太好晚風徐徐，吃飯喝酒舒心。,"For the first time, the door of the wine was open and the semi -open environment.The weather is too good, the wind is slow, eating and drinking comfortably."
食物很好吃，也有很多日本酒選擇，半開放式空間，氣氛也不錯,"The food is delicious, there are many Japanese wine choices, semi -open space, and the atmosphere is also good"
低消一人要一千，也許是因為座位數不多，但整體的感受和體驗沒有很喜歡。座位滿擁擠，空間不大，以這個價位消費不只不夠舒適，也沒有感受到太多酒的價值，因為吧台和客人太靠近，還會被推銷一些限量下酒菜，備感壓力,"It takes one thousand to eliminate one person, maybe because there are not many seats, but the overall feelings and experiences do not like it.The seats are crowded and the space is not large. The consumption at this price is not only not comfortable enough, but also does not feel the value of too much wine, because the bar and the guests are too close, and they will also be promoted to some limited amounts of wine and vegetables."
每次到小酒，都可以品嚐不同的清酒，吧主很用心每週都換酒單，這麼棒的地方，還不來？,"Every time you get to small wine, you can taste different sake. The owner is very deeding to change the wine list every week. Isn't it come to such a great place?"
品嚐清酒的好地方，老闆介紹的很仔細，東西好吃,"The good place to taste sake, the boss introduced very carefully, the things are delicious"
"巷子內的激情❤️‍🔥
內行人的共鳴🥳
口袋得能比拼😉
千杯唯我獨醒☺️ …","Passion in the alley ❤️ 内
Resonance of the insiders 共
Pockets can compete with 能 能 能 能 能
Thousands of cups, but I wake up alone 唯️ ..."

正哥很會搭配餐酒，也很多知識能聊，炸玉米極好吃,"Brother Zheng is very good at meal wine, and many knowledge can be talked about. Fried corn is very delicious"
氣氛非常好，但我吃不太飽😌 …,"The atmosphere is very good, but I don’t eat too much ..."
清酒，台菜搭配好去處,"Sake, Taiwanese cuisine with a good place to go"
身為一個清酒吧，除了酒好喝，食物這麼好吃太不合理了，每次去都來不及拍就吃光🤭 …,"As a bartender, except for the delicious drink, the food is so delicious. It is too unreasonable to eat it every time I go."
"生日來喝酒吃飯
店內加我們共兩組 全部四位客人
卻被遺漏了兩個餐點 還是分開時間點的餐
QQ

服務人員收盤也不是太積極 在滑手機看短影片（？
介紹餐點酒類也頗小聲不是太清楚  不知道 感受上不是太好

不確定有沒有收服務費 如果有收的話會生氣 😂

不過餐點 酒類 都很讚

想再來但又害怕失望 🫠","Drink and eat at birthday
There are two groups of all four guests in the store in the store
But I was missed two meals or a meal at a time separately
Qq

The service personnel are not too active to watch short movies on sliding mobile phones (?
Introduction to meals is not very good, I do n’t know if I do n’t know how good feelings are

I'm not sure if there is a service fee, if it is collected, it will be angry.

But the meals are very good

I want to come again but I'm afraid of disappointment 想"
好推包場，老闆超用心朋友們也都很融入氛圍之中🥰💕 …,"Good pushing the charter, the boss's super -hearted friends are also very integrated into the atmosphere ..."
東西不錯，但很常點餐後發現沒有menu的食物,"It is good, but I often find that there is no Menu after ordering"
"氣氛很棒的日本清酒店
每次來酒單都不一樣
能喝到不同種類的清酒🍶","The atmosphere is great, Japan Clear Hotel
Every time I come to the wine list is different

很喜歡，清酒和食物都美味，是一個在意細節風味的好所在，小城秘境，想經常造訪。,I like it very much. Both sake and food are delicious. It is a good place to care about the details of the details.
謝謝老闆，HAPPY 星期三！,"Thank you boss, Happy Wednesday!"
就算不熟悉日本酒也很適合來，老闆很會推薦。下酒菜很好吃，價格也很實在。,"Even if you are not familiar with Japanese wine, it is very suitable for the boss.The wine and vegetables are delicious and the price is real."
"不知到是否因為中午的菜色不同，所以感覺有點失望
和旁桌靠的非常近不舒服
照片不見了，和朋友點了義大利感覺很普通
完全沒有小酒館的氛圍
服務也沒有感受到熱情","I wonder if it feels a little disappointed because the dishes of the noon are different
It's very close to the side table, uncomfortable
The photo is gone, and it feels ordinary to order Italy with my friends
There is no atmosphere of a tavern at all
The service did not feel enthusiastic"
"超級多特別的酒款
餐點超讚👍 …","Super special wine
The meal is superb ..."
哇靠這薯條跟麥當勞的平起平坐欸,Wow relying on this fries and McDonald's

非常適合兩個人來小酌 記得至臉書預約喔,Very suitable for two people to make a drink and remember to make an appointment at Facebook

"每當我訪問台北時，我總是喜歡這個地方。他們獨特的日本酒收藏以及沒有喧鬧人群的舒適氛圍總是讓我留下深刻的印象。

請在訪問前幾週預訂。","Whenever I visit Taipei, I always like this place.Their unique Japanese wine collection and the comfortable atmosphere without noisy people always impressed me.

Please book a few weeks before the visit."
我的女朋友在雜誌上看到這個地方的廣告，她決定我們應該試試看。  在美國，這將被視為“牆上的洞”機構。  基本上有2張桌子和6張吧凳。  店主不斷地向您推銷一切都是多麼新鮮和美味。  它可能很新鮮，但缺乏準備。我們讓店主為我們提供他認為他的廚房能提供的最好的食物。  除了半殼牡蠣和一片酸橙之外，其他一切都很糟糕。  清酒的選擇很不錯，但價格過高。  總而言之，這是我迄今為止在台灣吃過的最糟糕的一餐。  此外，這是我在任何地方經歷過的最糟糕的 150 美元體驗。,"My girlfriend saw the advertisement in this place in the magazine, and she decided that we should try it.In the United States, this will be regarded as a ""hole on the wall"" agency.Basically there are 2 tables and 6 stools.The owner is constantly selling to you how fresh and delicious everything is.It may be fresh, but lack of preparation.We let the owner provide us with the best food he thinks he can provide.Except for half -shell oysters and a piece of lime, everything else is bad.The choice of sake is very good, but the price is too high.All in all, this is the worst meal I have eaten in Taiwan so far.In addition, this is the worst 150 dollar experience I have experienced anywhere."
"很棒的日式居酒屋風格的菜單（只有日文/中文），還有以歐洲為中心的英文菜單。工作人員樂於助人，會說多種語言，並擁有一位清酒大師，提供精選的清酒，請務必詢問他的搭配建議。非常適合在前面享用食物和飲料，也可以通過後面的秘密滑動門進入一個僻靜的 4 人清酒吧。

我期待著回來。","A great Japanese -style izakaya -style menu (only Japanese/Chinese), and European menu centered on Europe.The staff is helpful to speak in a variety of languages, and has a sake master who provides a selected sake. Please be sure to ask his matching suggestions.It is very suitable for enjoying food and drinks in front. You can also enter a secluded 4 -person sake bar through the secret slide door behind.

I look forward to returning."
令人驚嘆的氛圍和美味的清酒！,Amazing atmosphere and delicious sake!
"《食尚玩家》食尚總部後花園，限量慢來吃不到
