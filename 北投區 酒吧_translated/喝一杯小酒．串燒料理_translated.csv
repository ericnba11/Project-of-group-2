"小店座位不多，先打個電話比較保險。

食物美味。烤物好吃，但炸物醃漬的比較鹹。上菜速度很快。

生啤酒推推，順口好入喉~","There are not many seats in the small shop.

Food delicious.The grill is delicious, but the fried material is marinated than salty.The food is fast.

Push raw beer push, and go into the throat well ~"
位於明德站跟石牌站中間的一間小型居酒屋，店內位子不多（約6個位子），建議事先訂位較為保險。所有餐點皆現點現做，口味及品質皆有一定水準（對的起這個價位），是個適合跟朋友聊天小酌的好地方，日後有機會再回訪。,A small izakaya located in the middle of Mingde Station and Shipai Station. There are not many seats (about 6 digits) in the store. It is recommended to book a place in advance.All meals are made now. There are a certain level of taste and quality (at this price). It is a good place suitable for chatting with friends. There will be a chance to return to visit in the future.

"環境乾淨舒服，座位較少只有吧台約7-8位（但很寬敞）
老闆/闆娘人很耐斯~
今天踩點所以只簡單點了一些
椒鹽牛肉串 - simple is the best. 調味、油花適中
羊肉串 - 很香，搭檸檬汁很爽口嚼勁
雞肉蔥串 - 肉很嫩，好吃
烤飯團 - 烤的口感不錯，個人覺得醬濃一點滲一點會更香更好
明太子玉子焼き - 內裏很膨鬆，搭明太子調味正好

適合晚上想放鬆跟好友喝點小酒時來","Clean and comfortable environment, fewer seats only 7-8 seats at the bar and platform (but very spacious)
Boss / Boss Niang people are very long ~
Today's stepping point so it's only a simple point
Pepper and Salt Beef skewers - simple is the best. Seasoning, moderate oil
Lamb skewers - very fragrant, very refreshing with lemon juice

Mint Yuzu Jake - The inside is very loose, and the seasoning is right to take the mint

Suitable for night want to relax when you come with friends drink a little wine"
"新開兩個月的小居酒屋
位子不多 氛圍不錯
餐食方面
-鹽烤雞肉串 雞腿肉多汁 有夾一點蔥 居酒屋必備 單純的美味
-明太子雞肉串是雞胸肉
上層明太子醬淡淡鹹香
平衡了肉質
-羊肉串 個人很愛羊肉的味道
筋也烤的脆口 簡單調味就很好吃
-鹹豬肉 油脂與焦香 絕對下酒
搭一旁的酸甜醬汁也好吃
-剝皮辣椒牛 很多汁 剝皮辣椒的微辣跟牛肉很搭
-烤飯糰 有包餡 沒注意是什麼
似乎是鮭魚鬆？外層烤的乾香
想來個主食搭餐可以點
-烤透抽 肉質軟Q 頭部乾香 適合下酒 搭配日式美乃滋又更多了層次
-韓國櫛瓜 一份兩串 口感不錯 汁跟櫛瓜味感覺比一般的櫛瓜少一點 但也還行
-鱈魚肝 我就愛這味 大家都是罐頭配和風洋蔥 我就愛
-烤杏鮑菇 多汁飽滿 沾著胡椒粉也挺不錯的
-番茄豬肉卷 捲在其中的小番茄有去皮 咬下直接爆汁 非常爽快

店面座位雖然不多但更有在地小店特色，串燒品項需要花時間製作因此出餐速度稍慢，但是味道很不錯,"Although there are not many store seats, it is more characteristic in local shops. The skewers need to take time to make it. Therefore, the meal is slightly slower, but the taste is very good."
店不大位置不多，但我就是喜歡這種小小店，一個人喝著啤酒吃著烤串⋯⋯就是爽,"There are not many places in the store, but I just like this kind of small shop. I drink beer alone and eat skewers."
石牌周邊竟然有隱藏版日式居酒屋，Sapporo生啤大讚👍,"There is a hidden Japanese -style izakaya around the stone brand, Sapporo's raw beer praises"
"內用位置不多，可能要稍微候位等待
但是食物好吃，明太子很推！
老闆跟老闆娘很親切～","There are not many internal use positions, you may have to wait a little bit
But the food is delicious, Prince Ming is very pushing!
The boss and the boss are very kind ~"
老闆烤功一流，肉該脆的脆該嫩的嫩，肉汁也飽滿，已經來過多次！,"The boss is first -class roasting, the meat should be crispy crispy, tender, and the gravy is full. It has been here many times!"
本來想下班小酌幾杯，沒想到食物讓我驚艷，很愛蛤蜊絲瓜，烤羊肉，雞軟骨，剝皮辣椒肉捲，真心大推....整體來說蠻划算的,"I wanted to have a drink for a few drinks from get off work. I did n’t expect that the food made me amazing. I love clam loofah, grilled lamb, chicken cartilage, peeling pepper rolls, and I really push it ... overall"

"食材新鮮，氣氛榮洽，老闆親切
可惜就是位子少了些，適合第二攤、小酌
推薦生啤寄杯方案，價格實惠。","The ingredients are fresh, the atmosphere is glory, and the boss is kind
Unfortunately, there are fewer seats, suitable for the second stall and drinking
Recommend a raw beer to send a cup plan, which is affordable."
老闆服務很好，店裡座位不多很溫馨,"The boss service is very good, the shop is not much warm in the store"
"這家店真的是能給五顆星，服務氣氛料理都很讚，但是建議老闆菜單定價要做調整，能吃得出食材都不簡單，料理也真的是用心。只是一家店如果所有品項都要用力賺回本，我想經營的可能會有點辛苦。
很想再吃，只可惜自己錢包不爭氣，只好放棄了。","This shop can really give five stars. The service atmosphere is great, but it is recommended that the boss menu pricing should be adjusted. It is not easy to eat ingredients, and the cooking is really attentive.It is just that if all the items must earn back the book, I want to operate a bit hard.
I really want to eat it again, but unfortunately I have no choice but to give up."
食材新鮮，用料實在，店面小小的但很溫馨，可以跟老闆老闆娘聊天很開心😁😁,"The ingredients are fresh, the ingredients are real, the store is small but very warm, and I can chat with the boss and the mother and mother."

口味很普通，明太子玉子燒根本是麵粉糕...無法接受，幾乎沒有明太子味，都是美乃滋,The taste is very ordinary.
老闆跟老闆娘都很親切，餐點氣氛也很棒....,"The boss and the boss are very kind, and the atmosphere of the meal is also great ..."
