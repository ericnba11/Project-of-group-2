"有兩個包廂和一個高腳椅區是可以看到101的，景色很棒。平日低消一人一杯飲料，有特殊包廂需求可以先電話訂位。假日（五六日）包廂一人低消一千。酒類飲品為主，軟性飲料只有汽水。開車前往可以停地下室停車場，並請店員消磁（酒後不開車開車不喝酒）。有提供餐點，也可以點紫艷中餐廳的餐點，但是位置不大要正式用餐還是建議在中餐廳。
紫艷酒吧的101景很棒，求婚選在這邊很不錯。兩個月前先打電話跟酒吧提出需要包廂的需求，店員有提醒佈置不能黏貼，五點就可以前往佈置。當天兩個男店員人都很友善，不會讓人有壓力，提出要求也均幫忙，並有提醒燈光8點後會轉暗等小細節。5點前往放好花和佈置後，7點先去隔壁的紫艷中餐廳用餐，9點再回到酒吧求婚成功。（玫瑰花瓣是自己準備的，香檳和冰桶是酒吧提供）蠻推可以在這邊辦簡單的聚會和小活動～","There are two boxes and a tall chair area. You can see 101, and the scenery is great.It usually disappears a glass of drinks, and there is a special box need to book a phone call.Holidays (56th) the box consumes one thousand in one person.Beef beverages are mainly alcoholic beverages, and soft drinks are only soda.You can stop the basement parking lot, and ask the clerk to be demagnetized (do not drive and drink after drinking).If you provide meals, you can also order the meal of the Ziyan Chinese restaurant, but if you do n’t have a large location, it is recommended to be in a Chinese restaurant.
The 101 scene of Ziyan Bar is great, and the proposal is very good here.Two months ago, I called the box with the bar for the box. The clerk reminded that the layout cannot be pasted, and you can go to the arrangement at five o'clock.On the day, the two male clerks were very friendly and would not make people under pressure. They also asked for help, and reminded small details such as the lights after 8 o'clock.After going to the flowers and arrangement at 5 o'clock, go to the Ziyan Chinese restaurant next door at 7 o'clock, and then return to the bar to propose a proposal at 9 o'clock.(Rose petals are prepared by themselves, champagne and ice buckets are provided by the bar.)

"2023/10/18  疫情下睽違N年歇業的Yen Bar

如果W Hotel 10樓的Woo Bar是給年輕人去的，音樂節奏快熱鬧．．Yen Bar就是給大人去的。疫情下因為旅客頓減，好一陣子都只有開放10 F，甚至還要預約或實名制．．。

從前的Yen Bar要低消8000才可以坐在包廂，對情侶2人天方夜譚。這次進去竟然小貓兩三隻十分幽靜。希望可以早日回復往日光景。

In the past, Yen Bar had to consume 8,000 lows before sitting in the box, and the couple 2 were everywhere.This time I went in, and the kittens were very quiet.Hope to reply to the past as soon as possible.

"酒吧不大

在31高層樓，和珍煮丹合作的下午茶偏甜但好吃，飲品無限暢飲+可點酒類8種，雙人套餐優惠假加上景觀和氣氛來說覺得CP值蠻高的。,"In the 31 high -rise buildings, the afternoon tea co -operated with Zhenzhu Dan is sweet but delicious.

套餐含5甜點、3鹹食、4調酒，咖啡茶無限續，個人感覺甜鹹比例可再調整（例如由5：3改為4：4或3：5），畢竟雖好吃但太膩口。
個人很愛不知春茶，味香性甘，解膩一流。熱可可比阿華田還難喝不推。

The package contains 5 desserts, 3 salty foods, 4 bartending, coffee and tea is infinitely continuous, and I personally feel that the sweet and salty ratio can be adjusted again (for example, from 5: 3 to 4: 4 or 3: 5). After all, although it is delicious but too greasy mouth.

"為了欣賞101塔的景色，去YEN酒吧是我做出的最好的決定。是的，它很貴——因為工作日每人最低訂購是新台幣 1000 元，週末是新台幣 2000 元——但我說它保值了。我透過谷歌地圖上的連結進行了預訂，並立即收到了一封確認電子郵件，沒有意識到工作日和週末有不同的費用，並在周日參觀了。我建議您調整時間安排，以便在工作日參觀！

至於菜單，midori 酸嗎？桑格利亞紅裝飾精美，味道也不錯。炸雞配炒飯，外面酥脆，裡面多汁。我強烈推薦這個。我不推薦水果拼盤——份量太小了。

總的來說，我們在台灣度過了一個完美的昨晚，在一個非常優雅和安靜的環境中進行了一次愉快的長談，並欣賞了101夜景，在那裡我們拍了許多令人驚嘆的照片。

I did not realize that there were different fees for working days and weekends, and I visited on Sunday.I suggest you adjust the time arrangement so that you can visit on your working day!

As for the menu, is Midori acid?Sanglia's red decoration is exquisite and tastes good.Fried chicken with fried rice, crispy outside, juicy inside.I highly recommend this.I don't recommend fruit platter -the portion is too small.

In general, we spent a perfect last night in Taiwan. We made a pleasant long talk in a very elegant and quiet environment, and enjoyed the 101 night view, where we took a lot of amazing photo.
