"店長精通英日文，且調酒功力高強，每一杯都順口地令人驚嘆。
另外客人多為日本人，是個可以在台灣體驗日本氣氛的優秀酒吧，值得一去！","The manager is proficient in English in English, and the bartending skills are high, and each cup is amazing.
In addition, most guests are Japanese. They are excellent bars that can experience the Japanese atmosphere in Taiwan. It is worth going to go!"
走日式的酒吧風，小小溫馨的風格，調酒有一定的水準，下酒菜也弄得不錯$$$👍👍👍 …,"The Japanese -style bar style, a small and warm style, the bartending has a certain level, and the vegetable dishes are also good at $ 6 👍👍👍 👍👍👍 👍👍👍 👍👍👍 ..."

環境很舒服，爵士樂在耳邊環繞，調酒非常好喝，是一間高素質的Bar，喝起來都很舒服，料理都是老闆手作，非常推薦，起司拼盤非常的好吃。適合2個朋友來聚聚。,The environment is very comfortable. The jazz is surrounded by the ears. The bartender is very delicious. It is a high -quality BAR. It is very comfortable to drink. The cooking is the boss hand. It is very recommended. The cheese platter is very delicious.Suitable for 2 friends to gather.
"二訪，闆娘的調酒沒有華麗的裝飾。
但，調出來的非凡哦！
冷面的老闆娘，很好聊喔👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
一定要來試試。 …","In the second visit, Ban Niang's bartender was not gorgeous.
But, the transfer is extraordinary!
Cold noodle boss, very good to talk about it
Be sure to try it.Mowing"
"調酒超棒，老闆娘很好聊天
目前只吃過煙燻花生跟滷肉飯，大推！👍
（滷肉飯是肥肉，怕肥肉的就要考慮一下了）

PS. 抵消 500","The bartender is great, the boss is very good to chat
At present, I have only eaten smoked peanuts and braised pork rice, push!Bleak
(Braised pork rice is fat, if you are afraid of fat, you must consider it)

Ps. Cancel 500"
非常舒服的bar，比起吵鬧的酒bar，我更愛這裡。荔枝酒讓我很驚豔！！！比起華麗的裝飾，我更在意調酒喝起來帶給人的感覺～闆娘調的酒非常適合Lady唷！闆娘人超級好的耶～適合想放鬆的人來唷～,"Very comfortable bar, I love here more than the noisy wine BAR.Litchi wine surprised me!IntersectionIntersectionCompared to the gorgeous decoration, I care more about the feeling of drinking and drinking. The wine of Ban Niang is very suitable for Lady!The Ban Niang people are super good ~ suitable for those who want to relax ~"
"酒吧沒有時下流行的華麗創意調酒，只販賣基本的調酒款及提供各種威士忌，當然，也有啤酒。
樸素、低調是我對這家酒吧的第一印象。
<完整圖文介紹Google搜尋：日常食札>","The bar does not have the gorgeous creative bartending, only selling basic bartender and providing various whiskey. Of course, there are also beer.
Simplicity and low -key are my first impression of this bar.

"Good atmosphere, nice jazz music, bartender is really friendly.

煙燻雞柳干 很下酒～～

喜歡聊天的可以來bochibochi！！","Good Atmosphere, Nice Jazz Music, Bartender Is Really Friendly.

Smoked chicken willow dried wine ~~

Those who like to chat can come to BochiboChi!Intersection"
日本客人多，老闆親切酒好喝，溫馨的小店,"There are many Japanese guests, the boss has a good drink, a warm shop, a warm shop"
個人非常喜歡的店，氣氛佳，酒品質高，大推薦！,"Personally like a store, good atmosphere, high wine quality, big recommendation!"
"店內的酒跟氣氛都普通，有一兩樣下酒菜還不錯，整體不如評價所說的那麼好，要聊天坐坐是個還行的地方。

一開始是想要在這裡吃飯小酌，但發現食物價格有點高，一碗白飯上面淋醬油打一顆生雞蛋要200塊，還只是普通大小的碗
我們兩個人點了酒跟一些下酒菜，過一下老闆突然問我們敢不敢吃生雞蛋，還說她的那個飯很讓人驚豔，我們禮貌笑笑的回應也沒跟她點，過一下她居然自己端了一碗給我們，我們一時有點搞不清是怎樣以為她要招待，後來付帳發現也把那碗飯算進去，感覺不是很好，而且我們明明都台灣人，給我們的帳單也要寫日文。","The wine and the atmosphere in the store are ordinary. There are one or two wines and dishes. The overall is not as good as the evaluation. It is okay to chat and sit.

At first I wanted to eat and drink here, but I found that the price of food is a bit high. A bowl of white rice is 200 pieces of raw eggs.
The two of us ordered wine and some wine and vegetables. After a while, the boss suddenly asked us if we dare to eat raw eggs. We also said that her meal was amazing. We did not order it with her politely. I actually brought us a bowl for us. We couldn't figure out how she thought she was going to entertain. Later, I paid the account and found that the bowl of rice was counted. It felt like we were clearly all in Taiwanese. Write Japanese."
酒好喝、氣氛佳、老闆娘人也親切，是個適合週末放鬆，非常有質感的好地方！,"The wine is good, the atmosphere is good, and the boss is also kind. It is a good place suitable for the weekend to relax and texture!"
"老闆娘很親切
調的酒很好喝，對酒會有另一種見解
想喝什麼類的酒可以詢問老闆娘會調出適合的酒
很喜歡
氣氛也很好很舒服❤️","The boss is very kind
The tuned wine is delicious, and there is another opinion on the wine club
What kind of wine do you want to drink can ask the boss to call out the right wine
Like it very much
The atmosphere is also very good and comfortable ❤️"
有先問店員低消300，結帳才知道300不包括店內消費，而是人頭費，加上酒一個人共六七百，覺得非常失望。,"Someone first asked the clerk to disappear 300, and the checkout did not know that 300 did not include the consumption in the store, but the head fee. In addition, the wine was six or seven hundred, and it felt very disappointed."
老闆娘很溫柔聽我說任何的事 鴨胸超好吃 今天來這邊是我說快樂的事,"The boss is very gentle and listened to what I said. Duck breasts are so delicious. Today, here is what I said is happy."
安靜，獨特，老闆親切,"Quiet, unique, the boss is kind"
🍸 …,🍸 …
"很讚讓一個外地人可以很方便的
又很容易的一目了然","It is very good to make a foreigner very convenient
It's easy to see again"
日式風格，High Class，有格調,"Japanese style, high class, style"
氣氛安靜 雞尾酒頗具風味,The atmosphere is quiet cocktail is quite flavorful
老闆娘讚讚,Boss lady praise
"一個可以享用飲料和美味佳餚的酒吧。

尤其是豬肉飯，調味符合日本人的口味，非常美味。

培根和牛肉乾也是自製的。

來台北的時候一定要去看看。","一個可以享用飲料和美味佳餚的酒吧。

這是一個很棒的酒吧，自從我五年前開始在台灣生活以來我就一直去過。除了喝酒，我還吃到了媽媽自製的美味燻食，於是我就迷上了。這是為數不多的可以一邊與擅長日語的媽媽聊天，一邊聽爵士樂，感受時間緩慢流逝的店舖之一。氣氛非常適合舒緩心靈，所以我自信地介紹給我的朋友^_^,"This is a great bar. I have been here since I started living in Taiwan five years ago.In addition to drinking, I also ate my mother's own delicious smoke, so I was fascinated.This is one of the few shops that can chat with mothers who are good at Japanese, while listening to jazz, and feel one of the shops that pass slowly.The atmosphere is very suitable for soothing my soul, so I introduce my friends confidently^_^"
"我正在尋找一個日本人可以去喝酒的地方，我在網路上找到了這個地方。
我是一名男性，但我選擇這個網站是因為該網站說它對獨身女性來說是安全的。

從中山站步行約7分鐘。
不過入口很難找哈哈😆請參考配件💡

餐廳氣氛昏暗，播放著平靜的音樂。

我訂購的物品如下（我依稀記得）
・愛爾台灣啤酒
・特製莫吉托
・鹹狗
·堅果
・燻蘿蔔
嚐嚐“煙熏澤庵”❗️很好吃！ ️一定想問產地哈哈

和擅長日文的師傅（自己經營生意）聊天😁很有趣✨

可以用台幣、日圓、信用卡支付。

唯一的缺點是洗手間位於商店外面，並且在多租戶大樓內共用，因此並不總是乾淨。我用的時候，非常💦。如果您擔心，請注意這一點。

下次去台灣一定還想去🍸️","I am looking for a place where Japanese people can drink, and I found this place on the Internet.
I am a man, but I chose this website because it said that it is safe for celibate women.

Walk from Zhongshan Station for about 7 minutes.
But it's hard to find at the entrance haha, please refer to the accessories 💡

The atmosphere of the restaurant is dim, playing calm music.

The items I order are as follows (I remember faintly)
・ Irly Taiwan Beer
・ Special Mogo
・ Xian Dog
·nut
・ Smoked radish
Taste ""Smart Zeya"" ❗️ very delicious!️ must I ask the place of origin haha

And the master who is good at Japanese (operating business by yourself) chat 😁 is interesting ✨

Can be paid with Taiwan dollar, yen, and credit cards.

The only disadvantage is that the toilet is located outside the store and shared in multiple tenants, so it is not always clean.When I used it, I was very embarrassed.If you are worried, please pay attention to this.

Next time I go to Taiwan next time I still want to go to 台湾️"
舒適的小酒吧位於一條小巷裡。也許最多8個座位左右。有點矛盾——因為飲料價格過高而雞尾酒價格適中，所以心情複雜。食物也中等……但最特別的是自製的熏制食品。業主整體上很令人愉快，但氣氛不太好。評論說我們應該點更多的煉金術，因為她靠煉金術賺的錢比食物多。說我們等了太久才吃到一些食物。等等。其他評論證明了這一點，並且會給你一個要點。總的來說，如果您在一整天的工作後想喝一杯並且您的財力雄厚，那就來吧！,"A comfortable small bar is located in a small alley.Maybe about 8 seats.It is a bit contradictory -because the price of drinks is too high, the price of cocktails is moderate, so the mood is complicated.Food is also medium ... but the most special is self -made smoked food.The owner is very pleasant as a whole, but the atmosphere is not good.Comments said that we should order more alchemy, because she earns more money than food by alchemy.It is said that we have waited too long to eat some food.etc.Other comments prove this and give you a point.Overall, if you want to drink a drink after a whole day and your financial resources are strong, then come!"
"經理很和善！
食物和飲料都很美味，我強烈推薦。","The manager is very kind!
Food and drinks are delicious, and I highly recommend it."
作為三人一組，我們自發性地走進酒吧，我們的計劃是在結束之前只點一杯飲料。然而，我們最後每人喝了三杯酒，吃了兩輪小菜。雖然調酒師堅持使用菜單，這可能有點不尋常，但她調製雞尾酒的方式確實很專業——從烈酒的選擇、所有原料、冰塊，以及混合所有東西的技術。強烈推薦！,"As a group of three, we walked into the bar spontaneously, and our plan was to order only one drink before the end.However, we finally drank three glasses of wine and ate two rounds of side dishes.Although the bartender insists on using the menu, this may be a bit unusual, but she is indeed very professional to prepare cocktail -from the choice of spirits, all ingredients, ice cubes, and techniques mixed with everything.Recommended strongly!"
"可以慢慢喝，燻出來的食物也很美味。
咖哩有印度辣味。","You can drink slowly, and the smoked food is also delicious.
Curry has Indian spicy flavor."
"一個可以放鬆和喝酒的地方。
這一切都是女主人自己做的！
這是一家只有櫃檯的餐廳，有 7.8 個座位。

因為他會說日語，所以他給我介紹了台灣一個可以吃蛇的地方^_^

台灣的物價有點高嗎？
不過喝起來很安全，顧客大多是日本人，所以很適合交流訊息^_^","A place where you can relax and drink.
All of this was done by the hostess himself!
This is a restaurant with a counter with 7.8 seats.

Because he speaks Japanese, he introduced me to a place where you can eat snakes^_^

Is the price of Taiwan a bit high?
But it is safe to drink. Most of the customers are Japanese, so it is very suitable for communication messages^_^"
"前幾天我出去喝酒了。柔和的燭光和音量舒適的爵士樂讓人非常放鬆。他們似乎還有各種稀有的威士忌。老闆會說日語，所以可以告訴你很多關於台灣的資訊。這一天，我們品嚐了台灣獨有的威士忌。謝謝。

致業主
請原諒我第二天不去。我去了他告訴我的酒吧，喝了他告訴我的威士忌。很美味。謝謝。","A few days ago I went out to drink.Soft candlelight and comfortable jazz music make people very relaxed.They seem to have all kinds of rare whiskey.The boss will speak Japanese, so you can tell you a lot about Taiwan.On this day, we tasted Taiwan's unique whiskey.Thanks.

Lead
Please forgive me for not going the next day.I went to the bar where he told me and drank the whiskey he told me.It was delicious.Thanks."
儘管我只是在事先不知情的情況下參觀了這家商店，儘管距離關門還有一個小時，但他們還是很有禮貌地為我服務。卡瓦蘭的高球酒非常精緻。熏制的菜餚也非常美味。我很高興意外地遇到了一家不錯的酒吧。謝謝你！,"Although I just visited this store without knowing it in advance, although there is still an hour from closing the door, they still serve me politely.Cavan's high ball wine is very delicate.The smoked dishes are also very delicious.I was glad to meet a good bar.Thank you!"
"這個酒吧有很大的潛力。一年後回來，遇到了完全不同的經驗。

調酒師/老闆非常不專業，對日本顧客給予優惠待遇，同時歧視台灣裔美國人。

當調酒師試圖用最低 500 新台幣嚇跑我們這群 4 人時，應該注意警告標誌。然後調酒師用中文問我來自哪裡，然後用日文向另一位客人八卦我。

不會再回到這裡或向朋友推薦這個地方。","This bar has great potential.Come back a year later and encountered completely different experience.

The bartender/boss is very unprofessional, gives preferential treatment to Japanese customers, and discriminate against the Bay Americans at the same time.

When the bartender tries to scare the four people in our group with a minimum of 500 NT $ 500, we should pay attention to the warning signs.Then the bartender asked me where I came from in Chinese, and then gossip with another guest in Japanese.

I won't go back here or recommend this place to my friends."
"這是我很長時間以來第一次去那裡。
氣氛和以前一樣👍
咖哩🍛 太棒了，謝謝😊 …","This is the first time I have been there for a long time.
The atmosphere is the same as before.
The curry is great, thank you ..."
這是一個氣氛很好的空間。日語還可以，還有自製的煙燻起司和其他小吃以及飲料。這是一家安全又令人放鬆的酒吧，由一位出色的女主人經營。,"This is a good atmosphere.Japanese is okay, as well as homemade smoky cheese and other snacks and drinks.This is a safe and relaxed bar, run by an outstanding hostess."
這是台北最好的酒吧，可以在輕鬆的氛圍中享用飲料。店長Rie對酒的知識很豐富，所以可以安心放鬆。,"This is the best bar in Taipei, which can enjoy drinks in a relaxed atmosphere.The manager RIE has rich knowledge about wine, so you can relax with peace of mind."
"這是一家舒適的酒吧，有著美妙的氛圍和美味的食物！
乍看之下入口可能很難找到，但是找到了！ ！","This is a comfortable bar with a wonderful atmosphere and delicious food!
At first glance, the entrance may be difficult to find, but found!Intersection"
幾年前我訪問過。這是一家安靜又令人放鬆的商店。,I visited a few years ago.This is a quiet and relaxed store.
完美的雞尾酒吧。店主營造了良好的氛圍，並且對調製雞尾酒的基礎知識有非常深入的了解。,Perfect cocktail bar.The owner has created a good atmosphere and has a deep understanding of the basic knowledge of cocktails.
"當然還有美味的台灣酒，還有理惠媽媽輕鬆的氛圍。
我鬆了口氣。
好店。 。","Of course, there are delicious Taiwanese wine, as well as the relaxed atmosphere of rational mother.
I was relieved.
Good shop.Essence"
一個人去的很棒的酒吧。調酒師非常友善且樂於助人。氣氛非常獨特，雞尾酒非常好。,A great bar alone.The bartender is very friendly and helpful.The atmosphere is very unique and cocktails are very good.
沒關係,It doesn't matter
這是一個美妙的空間🎵你可以放鬆並慢慢地喝酒。清酒的搭配也很完美✨ …,This is a wonderful space. You can relax and drink slowly.The combination of sake is also perfect ...
非常好的酒吧，調酒師會說英語。,"Very good bar, bartender will speak English."
很棒的氛圍和有趣的人，飲料價格嚴重過高，請注意。,"A great atmosphere and interesting people, the price of drinks is too high, please pay attention."
"單身女調酒師經營的酒吧
我日語很好，所以適合日本人。","Bar run by single female bartender
I am in Japanese, so it is suitable for Japanese."
確實在日本有點貴，但是我覺得熏制的食物還是不錯的。,"It is really a bit expensive in Japan, but I think smoked food is still good."
又小又髒的地方，沒有菜單和飲料的價格。當帳單來的時候，你會對這些費用感到驚訝。這是一個割喉的地方。避免它,"Small and dirty places, there is no price of menu and drinks.When the bill comes, you are surprised by these costs.This is a place to cut the throat.Avoid it"
放鬆和喝酒的好地方。調酒師會說日語和英語。,A good place to relax and drink.The bartender will speak Japanese and English.
好會日文的媽媽介紹美味的飲品給你聽！,Good Japanese mothers introduce delicious drinks for you!
我姐姐一個人經營。現在平靜了，所以我可能會再去,"My sister run alone.It's calm now, so I might go again"
"很棒的飲料，美味的酒吧食物。
非常適合安靜地喝幾杯。","A great drink, delicious bar food.
It is very suitable for drinking a few cups quietly."
非常舒適的地方，最多可容納 8 人，服務非常好，自製食物也很好，10/10,"Very comfortable place, can accommodate up to 8 people, the service is very good, and the homemade food is also very good. 10/10"
他們沒有為我們安排座位，因為我們是五人一組：（有六個空位）,"They did not arrange a seat for us, because we were a group of five people: (there are six empty positions)"
"時間過得很慢，我的心情很平靜。
我最喜歡的是燻鯖魚。","Time passed very slowly, and my mood was calm.
My favorite is smoked catfish."
稱讚,commend
日本人聚集的酒吧，可以交流台北的資訊。,Bars gathered by Japanese people can exchange information about Taipei.
鹹狗的柚子汁味道很奇怪。,The salty dog's grapefruit juice tastes strange.
很棒的地方，氣氛很好。,"A great place, the atmosphere is very good."
