"食物非常好吃，但服務品質不佳
點了兩道主餐，燉牛肉及燉雞肉
燉牛肉很快就上菜了，但燉雞肉等了一個小時⋯

在等了30分鐘左右時詢問兩次服務生餐點準備的狀況，，服務生兩次都答覆說「廚房正在做。」
又等了30分鐘之後詢問另一位服務生，才發現廚房錯單，所以根本還沒開始做。
等了一個小時，詢問三次，最後才發現廚房根本沒做餐點⋯
有點太誇張了。

後來補償是一份冰淇淋甜點。
但個人覺得10%的服務費我也不是很想付（有付，但付的莫名其妙）⋯服務生沒有主動發現餐點延遲就算了，客人都已經詢問兩次，也不會向廚房確認一下？

總之覺得很可惜。雖然食物很好吃，但不會想再來了。

Very tasty food but poor service. We ordered two main meals, beef stew and chicken stew.
The beef stew was served quickly but they took an hour to serve chicken stew…

After waiting for about 30 minutes, I asked the waiter twice about the status of the meal preparation, and the waiter replied twice that ""the kitchen is working on it."" After waiting another 30 minutes and asking another waiter, I found out that the kitchen had made a wrong order, so they haven’t even started making it. I waited for an hour, asked three times, and in the end I found out that the kitchen was not even cooking at all… A little too exaggerated.

Later compensation was an ice cream dessert. But personally, I don’t really want to pay the 10% service charge (I did pay tho, but it’s inexplicable). The waiter didn’t take the initiative to find out that the meal was delayed. The guests have already asked twice, and they didn’t even confirm it with the kitchen? In short, I feel very sorry. Although the food was good, I won’t want to visit here again.","The food is very delicious, but the quality of service is not good

After waiting for another 30 minutes, I asked another waiter and found that the kitchen was wrong, so I didn't start doing it.
After waiting for an hour, I asked three times, and finally found that the kitchen did not have meals at all ...
It's a bit exaggerated.

Later compensation was an ice cream dessert.
However, I personally think that 10%of the service fee I do n’t want to pay (pay, but the payment is inexplicable). The waiter did not take the initiative to discover the delay of the meal. The guests have asked twice, and they will not confirm from the kitchen?

In short, it is a pity.Although the food is delicious, I don't want to come again.

主餐我們點了塞寇燉牛肉及野菜燉雞，兩者的肉質都處理得非常軟嫩、入口即化，滿滿的香料味，吃起來很爽！
米飯都是香草飯，雖然不會有特別的口味，但是真的很香，米的口感配上醬汁也超棒～

主餐都有附湯，有點像雜菜燉湯，蠻好喝的～

我們有多加了一份安地斯套餐220元。甜點可以自己選擇，我們選了米布丁。
飲料我們選紫玉米汁，原來是酸酸的口味，感覺像檸檬汁多一點香氣。

"從秘魯回台2週，想念當地美食故興致勃勃的走進了這間秘魯餐廳大快朵頤一番，嚐嚐懷念的Ceviche和Chicha Morada，擔心吃不飽又想出菜快，於是點了Anticucho來吃，都點在秘魯吃過的食物，老闆是秘魯人看我在拍照還拿店內的羊駝娃娃坐我對面陪我吃😄
食用心得：有調整成臺灣口味較不鹹，醃肉有用臺灣醬油。Ceviche 的魚肉醃製較久沒這麼生（鮮甜味少了）醬汁是最傳統的檸檬汁沒得選，洋蔥不辣，口味較淡。紫玉米汁還可以，在台灣能喝到已經偷笑了🤭下次換印加可樂。牛心的部分烤較生，一個人吃三串後有點噁心...這道菜還是要多人分享才行。因為他將這兩道前菜變成主餐，所以附上馬鈴薯塊，醬汁意外好吃，也或許是要符合臺人對西餐的想像，其實放地瓜會更道地呢！
服務人員很親切，也告知週五週六晚上都會有音樂表演，一天臺灣歌手，一天秘魯歌手，餐廳的酒除了秘魯必喝Pisco Sour外，還有我愛的法國1664，以及多樣化酒水，大大推薦聚會放鬆的美味秘魯酒吧！","Back to Taiwan from Peru 2 weeks, I miss the local cuisine and walked into this Peruvian restaurant. All ordered the food that I have eaten in Peru.
