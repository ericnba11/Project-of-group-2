"關東煮吃了好多年還真沒點過炸豬排😆

—富士蘋果醬炸豬排—

平常來通常只會點關東煮，大不了加一些烤物，完全沒想過要點炸豬排，沒想到吃了之後驚為天人，甚至比很多豬排專賣店還要強，豬排本身麵衣不算厚也不刮嘴，單吃調味不太重，加上旁邊的蘋果醬後味道變得很有趣，微甜蘋果味的炸豬排意外的還蠻順口的。中間還可以搭配旁邊的生菜絲與蘋果片轉換一下口感，但烤吐司串就不知道在幹麻了，口感上感覺應該是烤得不夠酥，導致整個口感很尷尬😅。

—特撰燒雞串—

口味上一串是鹽烤，另一串是醬燒。烤製的火候把控的很好，外皮微焦的狀態下，內部已經熟了且仍飽和水份。醬燒也不是走重鹹派的，醬香微甜還帶有炭香。若只點關東煮再點上一份也是很爽的！

- Fuji apple sauce fried pork chop-

Usually, I usually only order Kanto cooking. I have added some grilled objects. I never thought about the main point fried pork chops. I did not expect to be shocked after eating. It was even stronger than many pork chop stores. Scrape your mouth, the seasoning is not heavy, and the taste becomes very interesting after the apple sauce next to it. The slightly sweet apple -flavored pork chop is unexpectedly smooth.In the middle, you can also use the lettuce shreds and apple slices next to the taste, but the grilled toast skewers do not know that they are dry and numb. The taste should not be baked enough, which makes the whole taste embarrassed.

- Special roast chicken skewers-

The flavor is roasted with salt, and the other is sauce.The baking heat controlled very well. In the state of slightly scorched the outer skin, the interior was cooked and still saturated water.The sauce is not heavy and salty, and the sauce is slightly sweet and has charcoal fragrance.It would be very cool if you just order Kanto to cook again!

"內湖這邊很知名的關東煮名店，位在金湖路上，門口旁邊擺著幾桶大型的日本清酒，配上低調的招牌，還有櫃檯旁琳瑯滿目的酒牆，再再表明這裡是個有吃有喝的好地方（？！）

由於也不會特別限制用餐時間的關係，所以尖峰時段想來內用的話，必須要先在櫃檯旁排隊等待。不過這時候可以先看看菜單想一下要點什麼就是了，這裡覺得一個讓我印象很深刻的應該就是煮蘋果了，看著被關東煮湯汁泡得有點淡紅色與褐色的蘋果在湯裡面載浮載沈的樣子，一開始還真的看不出這是什麼，不過吃起來卻意外的非常好吃～

店裡面的座位有很多種，比較低的多人木桌木椅（甚至可以拿塑膠製的玻璃瓶收納箱來當椅子，超浪漫😂）、類似吧台的單人高腳座位區、還有多人聚餐用的高腳鐵桶桌。讓人看了覺得真的很有日本下町的燒烤店風格，因為自己在日本待過一段時間所以對這種氛圍還有裝潢真的非常懷念☺️。

食物的部分，我覺得最棒的是湯頭跟醬料，這兩樣對了，基本上配什麼都可以非常好吃，當然這裡的用料也是非常高水準，不管是菜的品質甚至是量都非常有誠意。那個茭白筍的大小真的是令我瞠目結舌，搭配上特製的抹茶鹽，真的是吃得非常滿足😚

週末的夜晚，喝著熱熱的關東煮湯頭、跟身旁的人開心的聊天，我真的是心滿意足🥰

非常推薦這裡～

🍢🍺","The well -known Kanto cooking shop in Neihu is located on Jinhu Road. There are a few barrels of large barrels of large Japanese sake, with a low -key sign, and a variety of wine walls next to the counter. Good place to drink (?!)

Because the relationship between dining time is not particularly limited, if you want to use it in the peak period, you must line up next to the counter.But at this time, you can look at the menu and think about what the main point is. Here I feel that one thing that impressed me is to cook the apples. Looking at the cooked soup by Kanto, the red and brown apples are raging in the soup. The sinking look, I really can't see what it was at first, but it was very delicious to taste ~

店里面的座位有很多种，比较低的多人木桌木椅（甚至可以拿塑胶制的玻璃瓶收纳箱来当椅子，超浪漫😂）、类似吧台的单人高脚座位区、还有多Human meal tall iron barrel table.It makes people feel that it really has the style of barbecue restaurants in Shima -cho, Japan, because I have been in Japan for a while, so I really miss this atmosphere and decoration ☺️.

In the food part, I think the best is the soup and sauce. These two are right. Basically, everything can be delicious. Of course, the ingredients here are also very high. Sincere.The size of the white bamboo shoots really made me startled, and with the special matcha salt, it really was very satisfied with 😚

On the weekend night, drinking the hot Kanto boiled soup head, and chatting with the people beside me, I am really satisfied with

"東湖的關東煮名店 #太鼓判 ODEN BAR，以特色日式食材關東煮、和美女老闆闖出名號，從原本的小攤車，到金湖路的大店面，還賣起燒烤和清酒，生意好到傍晚一開店就開始排隊了！

先排隊候位，再依續點關東煮、和燒烤類。關東煮的精髓在於湯頭，蔬果熬煮的湯頭口感清爽甘甜，喝完不夠還可加湯。

關東煮有蠻多日式食材，像是整顆蘋果下去熬的蘋果煮，還有鱈魚豆腐、高山娃娃菜、魚子福袋等。

不過最愛的還是牛蒡天婦羅，乾吃或是泡湯吃，都有不同風味口感，有海味的香甜，非常涮嘴。

店內的氛圍就是寬敞版的日式居酒屋，很適合搭配燒烤或熱炒，一夜干和炒烏龍都不錯，再點杯啤酒暢飲一下，頗消暑。還蠻多住附近的家庭客和學生，上班族下班後小酌的也不少。

關東煮覺得魚子福袋最好吃，其他表現中規中矩，因為關東煮本身算比較清淡，沒有太驚豔的表現，湯頭不錯。醬燒豬五花和烤牛肉串重口味就覺得更好吃，沾七味粉和芥末都很不錯。柚子胡椒雞肉串也是比較清淡。起司鱈魚豆腐好吃，比一般的魚豆腐更嫩。,"Kanto cooking feels that the caviar blessing bag is the best, and other performances are quite satisfactory, because the Kanto cooking itself is relatively light, there is no amazing performance, and the soup is good.The skewers of the sauce and roasted beef are more delicious, and the seven -flavored powder and mustard are very good.Grapefruit pepper chicken skewers are also light.The cheese cod tofu is delicious, more tender than ordinary fish tofu.",0.206,0.035,0.759,0.9414

首先關東煮的湯頭是比較清甜的，習慣味道較重的人可以沾醬一起吃。最推薦鱈魚豆腐、蘋果煮、蒟蒻，吃關東煮必備的蘿蔔也燉煮的恰到好處，十分入味，在冷冷的雨天來上一碗，真的很滿足。

串燒的話比較沒有太驚艷的表現，每一道都算是規規矩矩。

最令人驚艷的就是日式炒麵了！味道完完全全跟在日本吃到的一樣，讓好久沒出國的我們一解對日本小吃的思念。炒麵醬汁不會過鹹，重點是美乃滋應用的非常好，讓炒麵吃起來滑順濃郁，會讓人停不下筷子。

明太子玉子燒搭配著蘿蔔泥吃也很療癒，玉子燒是屬於甜味較淡的，配上明太子，口感豐富味道也很不錯！

The most amazing thing is Japanese -style fried noodles!The taste is exactly the same as eating in Japan, so that we have not been able to go abroad for a long time to solve the thoughts of Japanese snacks.The fried noodle sauce will not be too salty. The point is that the application of Meiji is very good, making the fried noodles smooth and rich, which will make people unable to stop chopsticks.

The Prince of the Ming Dynasty Yuzi Bo is also very healed with radish mud. The Yuzi burning belongs to the sweetness. With Prince Ming, the taste is also very good!
