高粱的調酒讓我難忘

這杯調酒飲如其名
聞起來會有泥煤的沙場感
喝起來卻沒有這麼可怕
像極了戰後餘生

*Shinjuwan
利用日本威士忌 與夏威夷果的風味
帶出這杯酒的故事
喝起來和香甜有很重的夏威夷果仁味道
有點像新貴派的感覺
不會很難入口 適合新手嘗試看看

今天還有興 參與客座
子毅的調酒也令人驚艷
可以詢問看看 相關的調酒是否有留在店中

#維斯酒酒","Bar hidden in the alley
Just walk into the store
You will have a voice to tell yourself
: This shop is different

The bartender owner is a person in the art -related industry
But their bartending is still preserved
I just visited temporarily today
Sorghum bartending makes me unforgettable

*Battlefield Fengyun
This cup of alcoholic drink is like its name
It smells muddy sandy field feeling
Drink but not so terrible
It looks like the rest of the war

*Shinjuwan
Use the flavor of Japanese whiskey and Hawaii
The story of bringing this glass of wine
Drinking and sweet Shawei fruit flavor
It's a bit like the feeling of new nobles
It's not difficult to enter the entrance, suitable for novices to try to see
(If PS knows that you don't like the mud flavor, you can say hello to the winemaker. They are happy to adjust)

Today, there are still participating guests
Ziyi's bartending is also amazing

"一個有趣的酒吧坐落在住宅區的一條小巷裡。它是如此的隱蔽，直到我們站在外面，來回走動了幾次，想知道我們是否來對地方了，還是我們最終會在晚上 10 點敲別人的房子😅😅
我們走進去，裡面堆滿了書，卻不見人影。我們拉了一個又一個的窗簾，終於看到一群人在座位上互相聊天，卻忽略了我們，這很奇怪😑，因為房間很小，他們不可能錯過我們！
我們站了一會兒等待主動回應但沒有結果，所以我們問這是不是一個酒吧以及它是如何運作的😂那是什麼類型的任務！ ？
不管怎樣，他們回應並告訴我們要走得更遠去酒吧😃😃 ta da…！

We walked in, full of books inside, but we didn't see the figure.We pulled one after another, and finally saw a group of people chatting with each other on their seats, but ignored us. This is strange, because the room is small, they cannot miss us!
We stood for a while and waited for the active response but there was no result, so we asked if this is a bar and how it works. What kind of task is that!Intersection
