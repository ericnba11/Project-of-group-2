酒很有誠意，便宜&調好調滿，店員態度也都很好。店內播音樂品味優異，8-90年代的搖滾居多，是路過進來的，但很推薦～,"The wine is very sincere, cheap and full, and the staff attitude is also very good.The music has excellent music taste. Most of the rock and roll in the 1980s and 1990s came in by passing in, but it is recommended ~"
"氣氛很好的一間小bar，還蠻喜歡這裡的。
據老闆娘說，這一帶的客人多是住在附近的，在台灣工作的日本人，很多都是常客。看得出來，因為老闆娘和店員似乎跟大部分客人都很熟稔，是個溫馨的小地方。
酒類選擇很多，單價算是台北市一般的價格，再加上服務費。座位還蠻寬的，包括吧台區的高腳椅都算舒服的，是個很適合來喝酒聊天的地方。店裡可以抽菸，但個人覺得菸味不重。
老闆娘和員工都很親切喔，都是喜歡跟客人聊天的個性，這一點還蠻有趣的  XDD","A small bar with a good atmosphere still likes here.
According to the boss, most of the guests in this area live nearby, and many of the Japanese working in Taiwan are frequent customers.It can be seen that because the boss and the clerk seem to be familiar with most guests, it is a warm small place.
There are a lot of wine choices, and the unit price is the general price of Taipei, plus service fees.The seats are quite wide, including the high chair in the bar area comfortable. It is a place that is very suitable for drinking and chatting.The shop can smoke, but I personally feel that the smell of smoke is not heavy.
The boss and employees are very kind. They all like to chat with guests. This is quite interesting XDD"
"溫馨路線的酒吧，酒還好
缺點大概是店內菸味很重，必須坐在窗邊才比較通風吧
低消是飲料350元，但他們大多數一杯調酒才300元，食物不算，所以就是說進去得喝個兩杯才能達標，這點有點無言😂因為像我們如果只是想喝一杯也沒有要久坐的客人就會覺得有點麻煩","Bar on a warm route, wine is okay
The disadvantage is that the smell of smoke in the store is very heavy. You must sit by the window to be more ventilated.
Low disappearance is 350 yuan, but most of them are only 300 yuan for a cup of bartender, and the food is not counted, so it means that you have to drink two cups to meet the standard. Guests who want to sit for a long time will feel a little troublesome"
窗邊的位子view很棒，服務人員十分友善，當天很巧的正好遇到日本人尾牙，氣氛很熱鬧，適合三五好友來此放鬆聚聚！,"The seat of the window View is great, and the service staff is very friendly. On the day, it happened to meet the Japanese tails. The atmosphere was very lively. It was suitable for three or five friends to relax and gather here!"
"調酒很好喝
老闆娘們很好相處
而且一個外國服務生很帥哦","Blooming is delicious
The bosses are very good
And a foreign waiter is handsome"
氣氛相當好的一間bar，適合朋友相聚小酌聊天談事，價位合理，服務十分讓人感覺舒服😌 …,"A BAR with a good atmosphere, suitable for friends to meet and chat, the price is reasonable, the service is very comfortable ..."
"適合聊天的地方
不過有人抽煙時會煙味很重","Suitable for chatting
However, some people have a heavy smoke when smoking"
"環境：菸味很重
低消飲料$350ㄧ人，食物不能算！但飲料的選擇很少，無酒精的選擇更少。不喝酒的人去會覺得蠻困擾的。
服務人員的態度是好的。","Environment: The smell of smoke is very heavy
Low -eliminate drinks $ 350 people, food cannot be counted!But there are very few drinks, and there are fewer choices for alcohol.People who don't drink will feel quite troublesome.
The attitude of the service staff is good."
老闆娘很漂亮.酒也好喝.價錢又公道，適合小聚喝一杯的地方唷😃,The boss is very beautiful. The wine is also delicious. The price is fair. It is suitable for a small place to drink a cup 唷 😃 😃
特調調酒都好喝 拉麵超好吃 有收一成服務費 店員們都超親切 低消是400/人,"Special -tuned bartending is delicious ramen, super delicious, and 10 % service fees."
"放鬆喝酒的好去處，低消350
店員很耐心的介紹各式調酒👍 …","Relax and drink and drink, low 350
The clerk patiently introduces all kinds of bartending 👍 ..."
"臉書照片看起來是好地方
請問可以用信用卡結帳嗎？","Facebook photos look good places
Can I check out with a credit card?"
一開始坐在高腳椅的位置，坐久了背不舒服便詢問能不能換到旁邊空了很久的沙發位，結果說不行怕後面有人來訂位，講了很久又說如果到幾點幾分(大約一小時後)都沒人來訂位的話就給我們，位置空了很久，已經在的客人不給換，要留給後面不知道有沒有的客人，講很久之後才願意給換,"At first sitting in a high chair, I was uncomfortable for a long time and asked if I could change to the sofa position for a long time. If no one comes to order after the division (about an hour), I will give it to us. The location is empty for a long time. The guests who are already there will be left to the guests who do n’t know if there are any guests."
問店員品項一問三不知，室內可吸煙怕的人要迴避。員工訓練可以再垂直整合一點，調酒沒有特別印象深刻的。,"Ask the clerk Xue Xiang, I do n’t know, people who can smoke indoor to avoid.Employee training can be integrated vertically, and bartending is not particularly impressive."
店員很逗趣，不過本身在減少酒量，拼命點飲料和食物，結果酒類低消不到，希望改成其他東西也納入低消,"The clerk is funny, but it is reducing the amount of alcohol, desperately drinking drinks and food. As a result, the alcohol is low. I hope that it will be changed to other things."
原本是要散步~去到那邊喝了國王谷~很好喝~服務親切~服務人員談吐很好~一個人去也很自在~~,"Originally, I wanted to take a walk ~ Go there to drink King Valley ~ very delicious ~ The service staff is very good to talk about it ~~"
Whisky 選擇算多 調酒還行 重點是能夠抽煙 抽雪茄 沙發位置偏少,Whisky chooses to calculate more alcohol.
老闆娘親切好相處，配酒小菜好吃，氣氛好，環境舒適，很適合聊天,"The boss is kind to get along well, with wine and side dishes delicious, the atmosphere is good, the environment is comfortable, it is very suitable for chat"
裝潢很漂亮服務生和老闆娘態度都超好。,The decoration is very beautiful and the boss's attitude is super good.
舒服，氣氛好，老闆娘活潑可愛親切！,"Comfortable, the atmosphere is good, the boss is lively, cute and kind!"
價格相對便宜，蛋捲好吃，日本人很多..,"The price is relatively cheap, the egg rolls are delicious, and there are many Japanese .."
經典調酒種類齊全，價位中等。,The classic bartending types are complete and the price is medium.
營業到三點 常見的酒單 抵消300,Common wine lists at three points offset 300
很適合和朋友聚在一起的開心Bar ❤️,Happy bar ❤️ very suitable for friends who are together with friends

這家餐廳是日本僑民經常光顧的餐廳，也是一家很適合遊客和商務旅客光顧的餐廳，因為它會說日語，而且價格範圍與台北的酒吧相比也比較合理。,"This restaurant is a restaurant often patronized by Japanese diasporas. It is also a restaurant that is suitable for tourists and business passengers because it speaks Japanese, and the price range is more reasonable compared to the Bar in Taipei."
"日語流利的台灣女性工作人員會熱情地為您提供幫助。當您飯後想喝點小酒時，這是完美的選擇。各種酒類菜單每杯1,000日元左右起，即使是不熟悉該地區的遊客也可以放心進入。","The fluent Taiwanese female staff will help you enthusiastically.This is the perfect choice when you want to drink a small wine after meals.Various wine menu starts from about 1,000 yen per cup, and even tourists who are not familiar with the area can rest assured."
酒吧的氣氛很好，但飲料製作得很差。我的莫斯科騾子裡面有碎冰，所以它就像冰沙一樣，而中國藍則低於標準。多味香腸還可以。結帳的時候，本來以為按照菜單上寫的每人300台幣就可以了，結果每人加了100台幣，因為這300台幣只需要飲料。由於我們總共只點了250台幣，所以我決定多點一杯啤酒來彌補不足。工作人員很抱歉，還給了我們免費的花生供我們諮詢。總的來說，不會回去，但你可以自己嘗試。,"The atmosphere of the bar is very good, but the beverages are very poor.My Moscow's mule has broken ice, so it is like smoothies, while Chinese blue is lower than the standard.Multi -flavored sausages are ok.At the time of checkout, I thought it would be 300 Taiwan dollars per person written on the menu. As a result, each person added 100 Taiwan dollars, because these 300 Taiwan dollars only needed drinks.Since we only ordered 250 Taiwan dollars in total, I decided to make an extra glass of beer to make up for the shortcomings.The staff was sorry and gave us free peanuts for us to consult.Overall, you won't go back, but you can try it yourself."
"雖然是酒吧，但可以便宜地喝酒。
我現在有理由去這個地區了(^_^)ﾉ
如果你能晚待一會兒我會很高興。
萌最低價大概3500元(^_-)","Although it is a bar, you can drink cheaply.
I have reason to go to this area now (^_^) ﾉ
If you can stay late for a while, I will be very happy.
The lowest price of cuteness is about 3500 yuan (^_-)"
"我是經朋友介紹才去了那裡的。
從第一次去那裡，工作人員對我很好，我立刻就愛上了那裡，現在我每天都去那裡。
受到推崇的！","I went there after being introduced by a friend.
From the first time I went there, the staff was very good to me. I immediately fell in love with there, and now I go there every day.

"這是一家由三個可愛的女孩經營的酒吧。

還有一些簡單的菜餚可以吃喝。沒有卡拉OK。","This is a bar run by three cute girls.
There are many seats that can drink relaxing.
This girl can also speak Japanese.
There are also some simple dishes to eat and drink.No karaoke."
我期待一個熱帶類型的地方。這絕對不像哈瓦那，但服務非常好,"I look forward to a tropical type.This is definitely not like Havana, but the service is very good"
這是日本人即使一個人去也能放鬆的酒吧。所有女店員都會說日語。您還可以享用自製咖哩和水餃等輕食。酒精價格也是該地區最便宜的，因此很安全。,"This is a bar that the Japanese can relax even if a person goes.All female clerks speak Japanese.You can also enjoy light foods such as homemade curry and dumplings.The price of alcohol is also the cheapest in the area, so it is safe."
這是一家氣氛非常好的商店。我會說日語，所以即使你一個人也可以輕鬆進來。工作人員也很可愛而且友好。超舒服。在雙城夜市吃飽喝足後，以完美的方式結束一天的生活。,"This is a very good shop.I can speak Japanese, so even if you can come in easily.The staff is also cute and friendly.Super comfortable.After eating and drinking in the Shuangcheng Night Market, ending the day's life in a perfect way."
"可以說日語的有趣的酒吧♪
