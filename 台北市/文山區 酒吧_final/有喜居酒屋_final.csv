"第一次過來，好朋友生日選在這裡辦，一進來店面並不算大，但是看到菜單嚇了一跳，因為種類實在有很多種，看老闆一個人在處理，講真的真的很忙，要送菜，做菜，收盤子送酒，忙得不可開支
餐點的味道都很好，老闆也很客氣，我們除了喝啤酒也開了一瓶清酒，老闆看我們清酒喝完了，愛情的我們三分之二瓶的清酒
當天我大概6點40過去，當下現場只有一桌客人，大約7點半，店裡就客滿，看著老闆邊做菜，邊送菜，邊更客人喝酒聊天，居酒屋就是要這種氣氛
到最後我先離開，因為我有騎電動腳踏車，朋友們怕我喝酒騎腳踏車跌倒，老闆很貼心的把我的腳踏車收到他店裡去
跟我說我有空的時候再過去拿
沒有把每道菜色都拍出來
因為跟朋友邊喝酒邊聊天來不及拍照，只拍了幾道菜色

The taste of the meal is very good, and the boss is very polite. In addition to drinking beer, we also fired a bottle of sake. The boss watched our sake and drink.
On the same day, I passed at about 6.40. At the current scene, there were only one table guest. At about 7:30, the store was full. Watching the boss cooking, sending food while drinking, and drinking and chatting.

"很久沒有留Google Review了，為了平復當天晚上吃完極度不愉快的心情，決定來好好表達一下那天的用餐狀況。
首先，一上門看到菜單，恩...看起來都蠻不錯，菜單為台北市價位，空間氣氛都很好，感覺就是一間很好吃的店，review也蠻高的，很期待店家餐點的表現。
第一道- 泡菜，入口的酸甜度不平衡，味道過酸，菜也有個悶味，似乎不是很新鮮，建議可以去參考附近的松町和風小舖的泡菜軟絲，研究看看別人怎麼做
第二道- 生牛肉沙拉- 生牛肉本身不錯吃，但醬料調的沒有層次感，只有醋的酸味，這樣250我無法接受
第三道-  烤伍仔魚- 過了50分鐘才上來，當時店內只有四桌,  有點問號？ 用餐體驗極度差，但是不得不說這道是當天唯一有達到水準的
第四道- 炸雞 - 我這輩子第一次吃到日式炸雞可以這麼難吃的就是這裡，麵一完全沒有炸熟，整個炸雞非常軟爛，調味也很怪，更奇怪的是沾醬的美乃滋也油膩的很噁心，建議老闆可以去東區的無雙串燒居酒屋，看看別人怎麼做
第五道- 明太子烤雞串- 烤雞本身非常乾澀，明太子醬味道本身不足，味道也沒有趴在肉上，去參考激安食堂的明太子雞肉看看
第N道- 烤串- 全部的烤串都考的八成是燒焦的，這樣子可以拿來上菜給客人嗎？
最後一道- 酒蒸蛤蜊- 蛤蜊本身很新鮮，但香油也加太多了吧！我煮蛋花湯香油都沒加這麼多，整個喝不到蛤蜊本身的輕甜味，像在喝香油湯，基本上可以清酒蒜頭蔥蛤蠣就可以搞定了
結帳- 一人約五六百，以正常居酒屋價錢來說是不貴，但是配這樣的體驗真的是讓人心痛

今過這次經驗，讓人在深坑找美食的希望又破滅了，希望店家能夠先有一定的水準跟熟練度再開店，也建議想吃居酒屋或日本料理的人可以試試以下幾間，寧願多花點時間去北市吃也不要受氣
松町/無雙/激安/三千子／大黑","I have n’t left Google Review for a long time. In order to eat the extremely unpleasant mood after eating that night, I decided to express my dining status that day.
First of all, when I came to see the menu, um ... it looks pretty good. The menu is the price of Taipei. The space atmosphere is very good. It feels like a delicious shop. Review is quite high. Point performance.
The first-kimchi, unbalanced sweetness and sweetness at the entrance, excessive taste, and the dishes have a stuffy taste. It seems that it is not very fresh. It is recommended to refer to the nearby Matsuachi and the kimchi of the kimchi. Do
The second road-raw beef salad-raw beef itself is good, but the sauce is not layered, only the sour taste of vinegar, so 250 I cannot accept
The third road-roasted Wuzai fish-after 50 minutes, there were only four tables in the store at that time, a bit of question mark?The meal experience is extremely poor, but I have to say that this is the only one that day that day to reach the level.
The fourth-fried chicken-I have eaten Japanese fried chicken for the first time in my life. What is so ugly in my life is here. There is no fried noodles at all. The whole fried chicken is very soft and strange. The okani sauce is also greasy and disgusting. It is recommended that the boss can go to the non -Wushuang skewers in the East District to see how others do it
Fifth-Ming Prince Roasted Chicken Skewers-Roasted Chicken itself is very dry.
No. N-Bake-All Baked Strings are scorched, so can it be used as a food to the guests?
The last-wine steaming clam-clam itself is very fresh, but the sesame oil is too much!I did n’t add it so much of the sesame oil, I ca n’t drink the sweetness of the clam itself. It ’s like drinking sesame oil soup. Basically, you can clear the wine and the onion oyster.
Checking-about 5 or six hundred people, it is not expensive for the price of normal izakaya, but it is really heartbroken with such experiences

After this experience today, the hope of looking for food in the deep pit is broken again. I hope that the store can first have a certain level and proficiency to open the store.

接下來就讓我們等了快半小時後才來一道明太子雞肉串，心裡想說，等這麼久終於來了，第一口吃下去，心裡的OS就是WTF! !！從來沒有吃過明太子的味道跟雞肉的味道可以隔著一座山這麼遠，根本沒有入味啊！ ！！等這麼久竟然上這種東西真的讓人很火大！但還是好心的想說算了，說不定其他的會不錯吃，結果接下來還是讓我們等很久，然後幾乎每一道菜都是讓人吃不下去，要嘛就是超級鹹，該要入味的沒入味，調味沒調好，不然就是烤焦，還有，酒蒸蛤蜊加一堆香油是怎麼回事 ？？ ？？

麻煩店家，既然敢開台北市的價格，就麻煩拿出台北市居酒屋該有的水準，不要用這種低於標準的食物來讓消費者受氣失望！ 上菜速度也要大力改善，如果你上菜速度慢但是食物讓人有好的體驗，我可以接受，但是事實不是如此！
