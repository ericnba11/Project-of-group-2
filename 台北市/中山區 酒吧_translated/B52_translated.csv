"客人外國人居多，多為菲律賓、印尼、越南人。
每個禮拜天會有專業DJ放歌，後來聊才知道老師在業界有30年，難怪放得很好。曲風多為90，中美洲牙買加風的，Nice 很熱情的fu，偶爾混現在流行，也會有韓文歌。
半夜一點後偶爾會有外國人唱KTV
裝潢比較復古，每個包廂有鋼管可以玩，重點還有撞球檯可以玩，現在有撞球檯的酒吧不多了！","Most of the foreigners are the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnamese.
Every week, there will be a professional DJ to play songs. Later, I talked to know that the teacher had been in the industry for 30 years. No wonder it was very good.Most style is 90. The Caucutic and Greaters of Central America, Nice's very enthusiastic FU, occasionally mixed now, there will be Korean songs.
Occasionally there will be foreigners sing KTV after a little bit in the middle of the night
The decoration is relatively retro. Each box has steel pipes to play, and the focus is on the ball to play. Now there are not many bars with hitting the table!"
7-11 賣 25 元的瓶裝竹炭礦泉水，這邊要 $150. 很棒 👍🏻👍🏻 …,"7-11 sells 25 yuan bottled bamboo charcoal mineral water, which is $ 150 here. Very great ..."
臺灣人不多，外國人很多。適合喜歡聽音樂跟跳舞的人！,"There are not many Taiwanese, and there are many foreigners.Suitable for people who like to listen to music and dance!"
超讚,Pretty
有點失望，因為上面寫著禁止吸煙，但為什麼有很多人吸煙。我希望他們能更嚴格，因為它的氣味真的很糟糕,"A little disappointed because smoking is prohibited on it, but why many people smoke.I hope they can be stricter, because its smell is really bad"
警告。點餐前先問一下飲料多少錢，然後你才會發現非菲律賓國民的價格和像我這樣愚蠢的外國人的價格更高！女服務員會觸碰你的膝蓋並請你給他們買一杯飲料......毫無壓力，是的，對！這個地方最好避開，不要試圖嚴厲，他們只是喜歡欺騙你...,"warn.Ask how much drinking before ordering, and then you will find that the price of non -Philippine citizens and the price of stupid foreigners like me are higher!The female waiter will touch your knees and invite you to buy a drink for them ... There is no pressure, yes, yes!It is best to avoid this place, don't try to be severe, they just like to deceive you ..."
聞起來很糟糕。小瓶啤酒200元台幣。這個地方有很多醉酒的人唱歌/尖叫。很難想像任何地方還有比這更糟糕的撞球桌。我想知道為什麼我給它 2 顆星而不是 1 顆星。女士們最好避免喝酒，否則您的信用卡會受到損害。,"It smells bad.Small bottle beer 200 yuan Taiwan dollars.There are many drunk people singing/screaming in this place.It's hard to imagine that there is a worse hitting table than this.I want to know why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star.Women are best to avoid drinking, otherwise your credit card will be damaged."
週日下午被叫到這個地方，度過了一段愉快的時光，作為一個西方人，我的飲料費用並沒有過高，不像其他人過去聲稱的那樣，很快就會回到那裡,"It was called to this place on Sunday afternoon and spent a happy time. As a Westerner, my drink cost is not too high. Unlike the other people's past claims, I will return there soon"
網路上說下午2點開門。下午 4 點 15 分，他們都被鎖起來了。,"It is said on the Internet to open the door at 2 pm.At 4:15 pm, they were all locked."
我們進去後發現這是卡拉 OK 之夜。精彩的歌曲清單絕對是您在 KTV 連鎖店中找不到的。,"When we went in, we found that this was the night of karaoke.The wonderful song list is definitely not found in the KTV chain."
我喜歡它，這是一個我喜歡跳舞的好地方,"I like it, this is a good place I like to dance"
很漂亮，可惜空了。大問題是蚊子,"Very beautiful, but unfortunately empty.The big problem is mosquito"
避開這個地方。欺騙非菲律賓人。浪費錢。我向警方舉報了他們。,Avoid this place.Deceive non -Philippines.Waste money.I reported them to the police.
在B52你會享受很多！,You will enjoy a lot in B52!
不錯的消遣嘿嘿,Good pastime hehe
破舊的場地在一個破舊的地區，我的錢包在那裡被偷了,"The dilapidated field is stolen in a dilapidated area, where my wallet is stolen"
小酌好地方,Good place
