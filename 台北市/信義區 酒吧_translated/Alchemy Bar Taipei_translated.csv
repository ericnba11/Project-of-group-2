"很老字號的酒吧了

還點了Negroni跟Manhattan為基礎的店家特調，放置火烤的薰衣草、龍眼，木本焦香讓味覺隨時保持最佳，酒的口感一直不膩。不小心就喝很多。
最後一杯疑似味噌湯的是純好奇，口味滿複雜的，覺得比較甜。

I also ordered the specialties based on Negroni's and Manhattan. Putting fire -grilled lavender and longan. The wooden scorching makes the taste best at any time, and the taste of the wine has been not greasy.Drink a lot of accidentally.

"糟糕透頂的一次體驗⋯⋯先不論調酒口味，服務絕對需要加強⋯

當天跟朋友四個人拆開兩桌坐，從頭到尾沒有人招待及介紹，最誇張的是身為一家酒吧竟然可以講錯基酒⋯！

服務生A來問酒的口味如何，因為我覺得酒有個很強烈的味道，因此特別詢問基酒是什麼，結果對方說要回去問問？？？？（那幹嘛來關心我們 笑死）
服務生A確認回來後說是橙花跟琴酒（但味道真的很不像琴酒）

因為真的太不像，導致我太困惑，所以又抓了一位服務生B詢問
結果對方說是威士忌加白蘭地（？？？？？）

綜合以上來說服務真的很差⋯⋯
危機處理只有一直跑來問「請問是哪位服務生跟你們說的？」
我們不是要抓戰犯欸⋯？？","A bad experience of penetrating the top… Regardless of the taste of bartender, the service needs to be strengthened.

On the same day, I opened two tables with four friends. No one was hosted and introduced from beginning to end. The most exaggerated is that as a bar, you can talk about the wrong base wine!

Waiting A asked how the taste of wine, because I think wine has a strong taste, so I asked what the base wine was. As a result, the other party said that she would go back and ask?IntersectionIntersectionIntersection(Why do you care about we laugh and die)
After the waiter A confirmed that it came back, it was orange flower and piano wine (but the taste really didn't look like piano wine)

Because it really doesn't look like it, it causes me to be too confusing, so I caught a waiter b and asked
As a result, the other party said it was whiskey plus Bailan (? ???)

週五晚上我們想在信義附近找個喝酒的好地方。我們沒有預訂，但還是找到了一張 5 人的桌子。這裡的雞尾酒非常好，我們被分配了一張大桌子，度過了一段愉快的時光。這裡的工作人員非常樂於助人而且很有禮貌。音樂不是太大聲，所以您仍然可以輕鬆地與朋友聊天。,"On Friday night, we wanted to find a good place to drink near Xinyi.We did not book, but we still found a table of 5 people.The cocktails here are very good. We have been assigned a large table and spent a pleasant time.The staff here is very happy and polite.Music is not too loud, so you can still chat with friends easily.",False
我在台北的第一天在地圖上偶然發現了這個酒吧，很幸運在周六晚上沒有預訂就坐了下來。調酒師很好，給我推薦了適合我需求的飲料。很高興從“禁酒開始”（用報紙包裹）開始，味道清新清淡。還有“阿茲特克之心”，它有一點煙燻味。在繁忙的市中心有點秘密和寒冷的氛圍。下次去台北一定會再去！,"On the first day of Taipei, I accidentally discovered the bar on the map. I was fortunate to sit down without booking on Saturday night.The bartender is very good, I recommend me a drink that is suitable for me.I am very happy to start with ""Ban Ban"" (wrapped in newspapers), the taste is fresh and light.There is also ""Aztec's Heart"", which has a little smoke.There is a secret and cold atmosphere in the busy city center.I will go again next time I go to Taipei!",False
很棒的氛圍和很棒的飲料。我們預訂了晚上9點的2人位，喝了Naked & Famous和Alpine Meadows（配阿里山高山茶杜松子酒）——都很美味！他們還根據我們的口味偏好為我們調製了一杯NA雞尾酒，也很美味！強烈推薦。,"A great atmosphere and great drink.We booked 2 people at 9 o'clock in the evening and drank Naked & Famous and Alpine Meadows (with Alishan Takayama Tea Du Songzi) -s delicious!They also prepared a cup of Na cocktails based on our taste preference, which is also delicious!Strongly recommended.",False
這是一個真正的地下酒吧。找不到這個地方哈哈哈哈哈哈哈但我們做到了，氣氛很好，裡面有點太暗了，不適合我的口味，但飲料很獨特而且很濃,"This is a real underground bar.I can't find this place hahahahahahaha, but we have done it, the atmosphere is good, it is a bit dark, it is not suitable for my taste, but the drink is very unique and strong",False
"如此隱藏。它實際上是在 MQ 內部。詢問任何工作人員，他們會指導你。這就是地下酒吧該有的樣子，我覺得這裡很受照顧。這裡每個人都很健談而且友善。等了一會兒，但我不介意。哦，酒吧的秘密門從另一面牆向左滑動。祝你好運找到這顆寶石。這是值得的。

我點了他們的菊花汽水，我的飲料上放著一朵真正的菊花，橙皮上放著菊花。 （見圖）每次我喝一口，我的鼻子都會與花和果皮變得非常親密。一種微妙但令人陶醉的香味充滿了我的呼吸和味覺。絕對神奇。到目前為止我最喜歡的飲料。對我這樣的膽小鬼來說，酒精味也很小。

我最喜歡這個酒吧，除了令人驚嘆的對話和顧客的多樣性之外，就是他們的湯。我不知道你是否真的可以點，但是到了深夜，他們會在一個小玻璃杯大小的銅杯里分發雞湯。一開始我很困惑，但在喝了一杯之後，這道熱騰騰的肉湯簡直就是天堂。我確實讓我感覺更好了。身體溫暖了，我的心也溫暖了。","So hidden.It is actually inside MQ.Ask any staff, they will guide you.This is what the underground bar should be like, and I think it is very taken care of.Everyone here is talkative and friendly.After waiting for a while, but I don't mind.Oh, the secret door of the bar slid from the other wall to the left.I wish you good luck to find this gem.This is worth it.

I ordered their chrysanthemum soda, and a real chrysanthemum was placed on my drink, and the chrysanthemum was placed on the orange peel.(See the picture) Every time I take a sip, my nose will become very close to flowers and peels.A delicate but intoxicating fragrance is full of my breathing and taste.Absolutely amazing.So far my favorite drink.For the courageous ghosts like me, the taste of alcohol is also very small.

I like this bar the most. In addition to amazing conversations and customer diversity, they are their soup.I don't know if you can really order it, but in the middle of the night, they will distribute chicken soup in a small bronze cup of a small glass.I was confused at first, but after drinking a drink, this hot broth was simply heaven.I really make me feel better.My body is warm, and my heart is warm.",False
"Alchemy 酒吧一定是台北最不為人知的秘密。如果你之前沒有和朋友一起去過那裡，或者沒有提前研究過谷歌的評論，那麼你肯定不會輕易找到它。我們很幸運地在大樓轉角的 Opium Champagner 酒吧詢問。酒保很友善地給我們指了路，穿過另一個叫MQ的場地的入口。進入 MQ 後，您必須走右側的樓梯到二樓，最終到達光線昏暗的走廊。過了一會兒，不知道從哪裡進入或從哪裡敲門，一扇滑動門神奇地打開了煉金術的經典酒吧房間，感覺就像回到了禁酒時代。這是我們當晚的雞尾酒航班：
1. 禁酒開始，平衡良好，進入調酒宇宙
2. 菊花汽水，原來是我的最愛，清爽微妙的味道讓我坐上了躺椅
3. Green Lake，顯然一直是女士們的最愛，酒精度低，夏日風味十足，為什麼有人會點一杯近幾年在歐洲非常流行的Aperol Spritz，當你可以享受這樣美妙的夏日飲品時綠湖
4. Alpine Meadows，我很喜歡茶杜松子酒的醇厚口感和本篤會的溫暖，但上面燒焦的茶葉有點太多了
5. Kingston Negroni，這杯飲料讓我重新站起來，我喜歡經典內格羅尼的力量和苦味，它的咖啡直接衝進我的血管。
在煉金術館度過了一個美好的夜晚。我只希望我們能不受任何限制地入座，因為我們是晚上 8 點抵達時的第一批客人。","The Alchemy bar must be the most unknown secret in Taipei.If you haven't been there with friends before, or have not studied Google's comments in advance, then you will definitely not find it easily.We were fortunate to ask the Opium Champagner bar at the corner of the building.Jiu Bao pointed at us very friendly and passed the entrance to another venue called MQ.After entering the MQ, you must walk the stairs on the right to the second floor, and finally reach the dim gorge.After a while, I didn't know where to enter or knocking from the door. A sliding door magically opened the classic bar room of alchemy, and it felt like returning to the era of alcohol.This is our cocktail flight that night:
1. Starting alcohol start, good balance, enter the bartending universe
2. Chrysanthemum soda, it turned out to be my favorite, the refreshing and delicate taste made me sit on the lounge chair
3. Green Lake, obviously it has always been the favorite of ladies, low alcohol, full of summer flavor, why would someone order a cup of APROL Spritz, which is very popular in Europe in recent years, when you can enjoy such a wonderful summer drink Green lake
4. Alpine Meadows, I like the mellow taste of tea Du Songzi wine and the warmth of Benedind, but the burnt tea is a bit too much
5. Kingston Negroni, this drink made me stand up again. I like the power and bitterness of classic Negranini. Its coffee rushes directly into my blood vessels.

書櫃和二樓，幾乎很容易錯過，但我們很幸運！在另一家餐廳和酒吧內，我們進入了美國的禁酒令……我指的是台灣。哈哈。很棒的外觀和氛圍，肯定吸引了許多西方遊客。雞尾酒非常簡單，沒什麼特別的，也沒什麼無聊的，但就在中間。工作人員也很友好。,"Bookcases and the second floor are almost easy to miss, but we are lucky!In another restaurant and bar, we have entered the United States forbidden alcohol ...

101 大樓周圍的高檔酒吧。價格比較高，但是這裡的雞尾酒實在太好喝了！您可能想盛裝去參觀這個地方，因為它值得。我非常喜歡它並且絕對想再次訪問這裡。,"High -end bars around the building.The price is relatively high, but the cocktails here are so delicious!You may want to dress up to visit this place because it is worth it.I like it very much and absolutely want to visit here again.",False
七年來我第二次來這裡，我再次喜歡它！很棒的飲料和很棒的服務。從另一個酒吧入口，爬上右側的樓梯。,"I have come here for the second time in seven years, and I like it again!A great drink and great service.From another bar entrance, climb up the stairs on the right.",False
"超酷的地下酒吧，提供美味的飲料。 House還給我們每人一杯威士忌。飲料價格在350到450新台幣之間，價格還算公道。氛圍非常優雅和涼爽。

這是一個非常忙碌的一天，有一些會議和混音師，所以服務有點慢，但我不介意。調酒師們忙著有序地為每個人調製飲品，他們做得很好。雖然花了一點時間，但每杯飲料都很紮實。,"This is a very busy day. There are some conferences and mixers, so the service is a bit slow, but I don't mind.The bartenders are busy to prepare drinks for everyone in an orderly manner, and they do well.Although it took a little time, each drink was solid.",False

這是我在酒吧見過的最獨特的內部之一，還有同樣有趣的雞尾酒單。調酒師非常友好，會說英語和中文，所以對外國人也很友好。唯一需要注意的是，入口不是很清楚（要到達那裡，你必須進入另一個名為 MQ 的酒吧，然後走右邊的第一個樓梯到二樓才能找到它）,"This is one of the most unique internal I have ever seen in the bar, as well as the equally interesting cocktail list.The bartender is very friendly and speak English and Chinese, so it is also friendly to foreigners.The only thing to note is that the entrance is not very clear (to arrive there, you must enter another bar called MQ, and then walk the first stairs on the right to find it on the second floor)",False
Speakeasy 和 Cool 甚至與 Alchemy 不屬於同一個句。  首先，空氣中有一股潮濕的氣味，工作人員不知道當你說英語時如何進行對話，對於這樣的酒吧來說，杜松子酒和威士忌的選擇相當少，不過飲料做得很好……但我我不知道我想我們不會再回來了，周圍有很多不錯的酒吧。,"Speakeasy and COOL are even the same sentence as Alchemy.First of all, there is a wet smell in the air.

"這家酒吧位於大樓的二樓。您需要知道的第一件事是您必須告訴接待櫃檯您想去煉金術酒吧，他們將為您打開一扇秘密門。如果你走進去卻沒有提到這一點...他們會帶你去一樓的另一個俗氣的酒吧。

"週四晚上來的（需要預訂），酒吧非常熱鬧。裝飾和氛圍都非常到位，爵士樂隊演奏得很好，而且聲音也不是很大。

雞尾酒很貴（約新台幣 400 美元），但與我在台北以相同價格喝過的其他雞尾酒相比，雞尾酒很美味且味道濃鬱。氣氛真的很酷，你可以通過一個滑開的假書架進出。調酒師非常友好，為其他餐廳和酒吧提供了很好的推薦。,"Cocktails are very expensive (about NT $ 400), but compared with other cocktails I drank at the same price in Taipei, cocktails are delicious and rich in taste.The atmosphere is really cool, you can enter and exit through a sliding fake bookstore.The bartender is very friendly and provides good recommendations for other restaurants and bars.",False

上週五晚些時候我去了酒吧。我點了他們的牛肉拼盤。這是擺在我面前的最噁心的食物……全是骨頭和脂肪。我向工作人員抱怨，他們所做的只是聳聳肩，說這是台灣人吃的……真的……我不會推薦這個酒吧。,"Last Friday, I went to the bar.I ordered their beef platter.This is the most disgusting food in front of me ... all bones and fat.I complained to the staff that what they did was shrugging, saying that it was eaten by Taiwanese ...

很棒，但需要預訂以確保您不會被排除在外。很好的雞尾酒和精選的烈酒。氣氛真的很酷很溫暖。強烈推薦，而且它就在台北101旁邊，所以你可以看到塔的夜景。最好的雞尾酒是“masu Punch”,"Great, but you need to book to ensure that you will not be excluded.Good cocktails and selected spirits.The atmosphere is really cool and warm.It is highly recommended, and it is next to Taipei 101, so you can see the night view of the tower.The best cocktail is ""Masu Punch""",False
絕對令人驚嘆的體驗。如果您追求深度和大膽的風味，「禁酒令的開始」和「黑手黨銀行」的雞尾酒會是您的最佳選擇。他們的威士忌很順滑，客戶服務也很棒，儘管很忙，Kelvin 仍然非常細心和準時。還會再來的！,"Absolutely amazing experience.If you are pursuing the depth and bold flavor, the ""start of the banquet"" and the ""black -handed party bank"" cock will be your best choice.Their whiskey is smooth and the customer service is great.

儘管 Alchemy 曾經是周圍最好的雞尾酒酒吧之一，但它並沒有完全跟上競爭的步伐。當台北其他地方有很多更好的雞尾酒時，價格（~450新台幣）很難證明是合理的。上次我們去的時候聲音也大得離譜──我和朋友說話時幾乎失聲了。,"Although Alchemy was once one of the best cocktail bars around, it did not fully keep up with the pace of competition.When there are many better cocktails elsewhere in Taipei, it is difficult to prove that it is reasonable.Last time we went, the voice was so loud -I almost lost my voice when talking to my friends.",False

氣氛真的很酷，你打開拉門就能找到地下酒吧。如果你不看評論的話，這家店有點難找——進入 MQ 酒吧，然後向右走上樓梯。我們的飲料很美味，服務也很棒。不過有時您可以透過牆壁聽到 MQ 的俱樂部音樂！,"The atmosphere is really cool. You can find the underground bar when you open the sliding door.If you don't read the comments, this shop is a bit difficult to find -enter the MQ bar, and then go to the right to the right.Our drinks are delicious and the service is great.But sometimes you can hear MQ's club music through the wall!",False

"在 R&D 短暫工作後，我們參觀了 Alchemy（我推薦的另一個酒吧）。

酒吧位於大樓的二樓，有足夠的空間舉辦大型和小型聚會。菜單上有 20 多種有趣的飲品，主要專注於經典的現代詮釋。

工作人員很細心（儘管這是一個較慢的夜晚），但在製作飲料之間明顯感到無聊。雞尾酒調製得很好，雖然我嘗試過的所有飲料似乎都比較甜。

感覺很像一個酒店酒吧——台北有這麼多選擇，我不知道我是否會再回來。這有點不人性化。這個酒吧擁有的一件事就是擁有充足的空間：我認為這是大型聚會的絕佳地點。","After R & D's brief work, we visited Alchemy (another bar I recommended).

The bar is located on the second floor of the building and has enough space to hold large and small gatherings.There are more than 20 interesting drinks on the menu, which mainly focuses on classic modern interpretations.

The staff is very careful (although this is a slower night), but it is obviously boring between making drinks.The cocktail is very good, although all the drinks I have tried seemed to be sweeter.

2019 年 7 月 14 日曾造訪過這個地方。我喜歡這種氛圍，因為它不會太大聲，不會損害您的聽力和聲音。飲料很不錯，他們確實製作了招牌雞尾酒，透過火焰和煙燻裝飾非常酷。服務也很棒！特別是維克多，他在檢查客戶方面做得非常出色，並確保我們的聚會感到滿意。我非常肯定我會再回來！,"On July 14, 2019, I visited this place.I like this atmosphere, because it will not be too loud and will not damage your hearing and sound.The drink is very good.

這個地方非常好，親密，良好的氛圍，散發出某種等級，因為他們確實有著裝要求。菜單上的雞尾酒不多，但調酒師很專業，如果需要，幾乎可以提供任何混合飲料。他們甚至還有一個室內吸煙區……我能想到的唯一缺點是必須預約才能進入，否則就不行。,"This place is very good, intimate, and a good atmosphere, exuding some kind of level because they do have dressing requirements.There are not many cocktails on the menu, but the bartender is very professional. If necessary, it can provide almost any mixed drinks.They even have an indoor smoking area ... The only disadvantage I can think of is to make an appointment to enter, otherwise it will not work.",False
一定要預約，常常會有排隊等候的狀況。坐在吧台，調酒師會給你推薦一些很棒的東西,"Be sure to make an appointment, and often there will be a queue waiting.Sitting on the bar, the bartender will recommend some great things for you",False
"即使酒吧根本沒有人，服務也非常慢。兩次飲料都等了 30 分鐘甚至更長。酒吧裡大約有 4 張桌子和大約 4 個人，但兩位調酒師似乎不知所措。我見過一個調酒師為更多的桌子提供服務，但在其他地方仍然提供一致的品質。
莫吉托非常好，金湯力酒嘗起來像檸檬水（？）
那裡有一支非常好的現場爵士樂隊，這為這個地方的精美裝飾增添了一絲美感。
然而，我們輕鬆等了半個小時後就離開了，喝了兩杯酒。

這個酒吧很有風格，我很遺憾我不能推薦它，它有很大的潛力。","Even if there is no one at all, the service is very slow.Both drinks waited for 30 minutes or even longer.There are about 4 tables and about 4 people in the bar, but the two bartenders seem to be at a loss.I have seen a bartender to provide services for more tables, but it still provides consistent quality elsewhere.
Mogo is very good, Jin Tangli tastes like lemonade (?)
There is a very good on -site jazz band, which adds a touch of beauty to the exquisite decoration of this place.

樓上有一個更獨特的酒吧，您需要預訂。這家酒吧的價格過高，似乎利用了這樣一個事實：真正想去樓上的人有時會等很久才能有空位。從好的方面來說，法國調酒師很酷，雞尾酒很有創意又美味。,"There is a more unique bar upstairs, you need to book.The price of this bar is too high, and it seems that such a fact is used: those who really want to go upstairs sometimes wait a long time to have a vacancy.In good aspects, French bartender is cool, and cocktails are creative and delicious.",False
