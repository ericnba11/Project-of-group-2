3️⃣ Blasting fish egg cheese 🧀 baked egg-very delicious and at least the taste is light

Summary: The location of the West Lake MRT station is not too full."
在瑞光路巷內的韓式餐廳，停車蠻方便的，菜色多有些辣，也尚可接受的辣度，菜色感覺不多，不限量的小菜好吃，主食感覺份量略少，餐廳即使在平日生意也很好，需要訂位較適合，餐點對我個人感覺尚可,"Korean restaurants in Ruiguang Road Lane, parking is quite convenient, the dishes are a bit spicy, and they are still acceptable spicy. The dishes are not much. Unlimited side dishes are delicious. The business is also very good, it is more suitable for ordering, and meals feel that I personally feel that it is acceptable."
剛好來附近，時間已是下午一兩點了，幸好此店3：00休息，趕緊來午餐，猶如置身在很有特色的韓國餐廳，服務人員幾近休息吃飯中，依然很客氣熱心為我們服務，點了商業套餐，服務人員還會詢問是否需要續加小菜，感到很窩心，因為太愛不鹹膩的小菜，因為不太能吃辣，點個原味韓式炸雞，本以為自己點錯了，結果吃起來外酥內肉多汁鮮嫩美味，雖然有附胡椒鹽，但自己發明配上韓式拌飯的紅辣醬，也是很好吃，不會太辣，很棒的午餐，吃得飽飽吃得開心,"It happened to be nearby. The time was already one or two in the afternoon. Fortunately, this shop rest at 3:00, and hurry up for lunch. It is like being in a very distinctive Korean restaurant. After ordering the commercial package, the service staff will also ask if you need to add small dishes, and you feel very worried, because you love too much salty side dishes, because you are not very spicy, or order a Korean fried chicken. After that, it tastes delicious and delicious and delicious. Although there are pepper pepper, the red spicy sauce with Korean bibimbap is also delicious. It will not be too spicy. Happy to eat"
"小菜多樣化
炸雞不錯吃
海鮮豆腐鍋很普通但可以換冬粉很謝謝
冷氣可能開太久了會滴水😅","Various dishes
Fried chicken is good
Seafood tofu pot is very ordinary, but it can be changed to winter powder. Thank you
The air -conditioning may be dripping for too long 😅"
"食物不錯吃，適合聚餐享用。服務人員態度良好。
食物打包回家吃也好吃。","Food is good, suitable for dinner.The service staff has a good attitude.
It ’s delicious for food to eat home."
連平日都容易客滿的店，蠻受年輕人喜歡的，料理種類並不多，但也算有特色，份量不多，不限量的小菜好吃。,"Even the shops that are easy to be full on weekdays are quite popular with young people. There are not many varieties of cooking, but they are also distinctive. They are not large. Unlimited side dishes are delicious."
"內用過還ok,這次點外送點了2500左右，送來竟然是一大個塑膠袋裝所有食物，而不是用有底座的紙袋裝，沒有底座的塑膠袋食物送來都打翻，外送員有告知可能店家也沒包裝好，打電話去店家轉了兩次人員才聽懂我在說什麼… 店家說可以退款，高金額不想影響店家及外送員，所以沒有申請退款，希望你們外送包裝能改善，整個影響味覺口感","I have used it in the inside, and I sent about 2500 this time. The sending turned out to be a large plastic bag all over all foods instead of using a paper bag with a base. The dealers have notified the store that the store may not be packaged. I called the store and transferred two personnel to understand what I was talking about ... The store said that it can be refunded, and the high amount does not want to affect the store and the delivery staff, so there is no application for refund. Models, I hope you can improve the packaging packaging, and the whole affects the taste of taste"
"價格雖然略高
但完全符合他的價值
小菜還能無限續
餐點美味如同置身韓國
非常推","Although the price is slightly higher
But it fully meets his value
Small dishes can still be infinitely continued
The meals are delicious like being in Korea
Push"
首訪輪流請客韓式料理，小菜非常推薦，柚香蘿蔔薄片非常清爽開胃，魚板異於其他韓式料理餐廳，海帶也是清爽可口，小菜可追加續用，韓式拌飯跟辣炒年糕口味中規中矩，馬鈴薯燉排骨鍋內配料豐富，烤牛小排的份量略少，套餐價格設定上有很多需要加價，點餐時需要留意一下！,"The first visit turns to popular Korean cuisine. The side dishes are very recommended. The pomelo fragrant radish slice is very refreshing and appetizing. The fish plate is different from other Korean cuisine restaurants. The kelp is also refreshing and delicious. Regardless, the potato stewed bone pot is rich in ingredients, the roasted beef steak is slightly less, and there are a lot of price increase in the setting price setting. You need to pay attention when ordering!"
餐廳應該來過5-6回了，這次跟家人點了三人套餐，但海鮮煎餅居然有異味，還好反應後服務人員快速處理，慶幸我們三人高強肚。,"The restaurant should have been here for 5-6 times. This time, I ordered a three-person package with my family, but the seafood pancakes have a odor. Fortunately, the service staff quickly handled it. Fortunately, the three of us were highly strong."
"美味的韓式料理 韓式烤豬 泡菜海鮮
韓式煎餅 多種特色小菜
雖然熱量很高但真的讓人欲罷不能。","Delicious Korean cuisine Korean roasted pig kimchi seafood
Korean pancake -style specialty dishes
Although the calories are very high, it is really indispensable."
"從點菜開始就傻眼，有一半的餐點都售完，要不是跟朋友一起聚餐，不然真想直接走人，覺得太誇張啦！想吃的餐點全都售完。
馬鈴薯排骨湯：沒有馬鈴薯的馬鈴薯排骨湯，我們怎麼都撈不到馬鈴薯，後來請服務人員來撈，也撈不到馬鈴薯，最後服務人員去廚房裝了六小塊的馬鈴薯來加進湯裡，一鍋880元的湯，裡面除了排骨根本沒什麼料，不是太值得，還好排骨夠爛，湯頭也還可以。
海鮮煎餅：吃了滿嘴油！裡面沒甚麼料，又薄，但是油卻滿滿的，是我們吃了1、2片就無法吃完的餐點。
辣炒年糕：第一次吃到顏色這麼淡的辣炒年糕，應該是改良台灣人能吃的口味吧！味道尚可，但是沒有韓國味。
蔬菜雜菜：是整桌最好吃的一道餐點，只是還是有點偏油，尚可接受。
魚卵起司蛋：熱熱很好吃。
總結....這是間不是道地韓國味的韓國餐廳，連小菜都不是很道地的味道，但是台灣人接受度應該會蠻高的，這樣的價位，份量跟配菜不是太值得，但是服務人員的服務真的很不錯，這個很讚美。
有些餐點食用很容易噴灑出來或需要用到雙手食用，建議可以提供圍兜兜跟濕紙巾。","Since ordering, I have been dumbfounded. Half of the meals have been sold. If you have not gathered with friends, otherwise you really want to leave directly and feel too exaggerated!The meals you want to eat are all sold out.
Potato pork ribs soup: Potato pork rib soup without potato, how can we not get potato, and later invite the service staff to fish, and the potato cannot be caught. Finally, the service staff went to the kitchen to install six small pieces of potatoes to add it into the soup. A pot of 880 yuan soup, there is nothing except the pork ribs, it is not too worth it. Fortunately, the ribs are rotten enough, and the soup is okay.
Seafood pancakes: Eat mouth full of mouth!There is no material inside, thin, but the oil is full. It is a meal that we can't eat after eating 1 or 2 tablets.
Spicy fried rice cake: For the first time, I eat such a light spicy fried rice cake, which should be the taste that Taiwanese can eat!The taste is okay, but there is no Korean taste.
Vegetables and vegetables: It is the best meal for the whole table, but it is still a bit oily and acceptable.
Fish Eggs Egg: Hot is delicious.
Summary .... This is a Korean restaurant that is not authentic Korean. Even small dishes are not very authentic, but the acceptance of Taiwanese should be quite high. Such a price, the amount and side dishes are not worth it. But the service staff's service is really good, this is very praised.
Some meals are easy to spray out or need to be eaten with both hands. It is recommended to provide a bib and a wet tissue."
店內不知道是不是空調壞掉，有很多電風扇放在地上吹，整個很熱。點了松阪豬但真的超油，韓式炸雞的醬是另外給一個碟子，沒有和炸雞混在一起。另外辣炒年糕令我太失望了，跟菜單照片差非常多。,"I do n’t know if the air conditioner is broken. There are many electric fans on the ground and blowing. The whole is very hot.I ordered the Matsusaka pig but it was really oily. The Korean fried chicken sauce was given another plate, which was not mixed with the fried chicken.In addition, the spicy fried rice cakes disappointed me, and they were very different from the menu photos."
"….這個蝦子怎麼這樣子…🥹 比較不解的是怎麼三月自己有訂過再訂一次會是這樣的體驗🥹💔
建議外送包裝需要調整！送到家的時候湯全部在塑膠袋中灑出來 拿外送時可以直接從塑膠袋滴在地板上襪子上……💔💔💔","… Why this shrimp is like this ... 🥹 🥹 is more puzzled, how can I have a book again in March, it will be like this 🥹💔
It is recommended that delivery packaging needs to be adjusted!When you get home, all the soup can be sprinkled in a plastic bag to get the socks on the floor when you get out of the plastic bag ... 💔💔💔"
今天第一次和家人來用餐，餐點的部分今天點了四樣菜一個鍋還不錯吃小菜的部分也還不錯，但是（空間感非常的狹隘）走路進出大門走道都非常的小、最美中不足的是非常的熱裡面的空調真的很不OK，但是值得稱讚的事，服務人員態度佳。,"Today, I came to dine with my family for the first time. The meal section ordered four dishes today. One pot is not bad. It is very hot air conditioner inside, but it is really praised and the service staff has a good attitude."
中午點了韓式醬燒肉，吃到了一大半才想到要拍照，套餐和菜單上長得不太一樣，不過意外的好吃，很多韓式料理都偏鹹，這道因為有高麗菜和洋蔥，反而變得鮮甜不死鹹，配菜的泡菜非常好吃，可以續盤，午餐定食239元，以中午的小聚餐來說還蠻不錯的。有機會會再來用餐！,"At noon, I ordered Korean sauce roasted meat. After eating more than half of it, I thought of taking pictures. The package and the menu were not the same, but the accident was delicious. Many Korean cuisine was salty. Instead, it becomes fresh and sweet, and the pickles of the side dishes are very delicious. They can be renewed. Lunch is 239 yuan for lunch. It is quite good for the noon dinner.If you have a chance, you will come to dine again!"
不愛甜不辣，小菜如果換別的就好了。但還算適合三四人的聚餐。,"Don't love sweetness or spicy, if you change the side dishes, just change anything else.But it is still suitable for three or four people."
"炒豬肉份量滿夠的！
小菜有六種
但都偏甜吃就會有點膩
份量都滿夠的
可以再去嘗試看看其他的品項☺️","Fried pork is full enough!
There are six kinds of side dishes
But if you are sweet, you will be a bit greasy
The portion is full enough
You can try to see other items ☺️"
算是還⋯可以，好像沒有特別哪道好吃，就是中規中矩，六個人吃下來一個人四百左右，算滿實惠的！店裡氣氛也不錯，放了韓文歌，環境整潔，店員上菜速度也滿快的,"It is still possible. It seems that there is no special deliciousness, that is, it is quite satisfactory. Six people eat about four hundred people, which is full of affordable!The atmosphere in the store is also good. The Korean song is put on, the environment is neat, and the staff is full of food."
就是韓式，一般般，沒特別驚艷的菜色,"It's Korean, generally, no particularly amazing dishes"
"和同事們第三次來訪，食物味道不至於驚豔好吃，但是是適合聚餐的場所。
菜餚比起傳統韓式，會做一些比較時新的調整，搭配用餐環境，整體氣氛比較年輕。因為每次都點四、六人分享餐，研究菜單後確認，其實沒有比單點划算，約只送了氣泡飲的價錢而已（而汽水本身成本也蠻廉價的）。不需要飲料的人，推薦單點，選擇反而不會被分享餐的菜單選擇限制。
員工一如往常都很親切，特定的菜餚會鄰桌服務，多人聚會起來格外輕鬆。
店內桌次排列不至於擁擠，但是回聲、背景音較大，我們最近期到訪時只有另外兩小桌客人，但還是必須稍微加大音量才能聽到對方說話。以上食物到環境評比給大家參考。","For the third time with colleagues, the taste of food is not stunning and delicious, but it is a place suitable for dinner.
Compared with the traditional Korean style, the dishes will make some new adjustments. With the dining environment, the overall atmosphere is relatively young.Because every time I ordered four or six people to share meals, it was confirmed after studying the menu. In fact, there was no cost -effectiveness than a single point. It was only about the price of bubble drinks (and the cost of soda itself was quite cheap).People who do not need drinks, recommend single points, and choose to choose restrictions on the menu of the shared meal.
As usual, employees are very kind. Specific dishes will serve neighboring tables, and multi -person gathering is particularly easy.
The tables in the store are not crowded, but the echo and background sound are large. We only have two small table guests in the recent visit, but we must still increase the volume to hear the other party.For the above food to the environmental evaluation, give you a reference."
"座位擁擠
六樣小菜跟生菜盤可以續
馬鈴薯排骨湯（有肉味），排骨6塊、湯頭濃郁
很紮實的烘蛋捲","Crowded seat
Six small dishes and lettuce can be continued
Potato pork ribs soup (with meat flavor), 6 pieces of pork ribs, strong soup head
Very solid egg baking roll"
"整體來說還不錯的韓式家庭餐廳，小菜多元，都可以續的唷！

推薦品項：

烤豬五花，烤得恰到好處很好吃ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
石鍋拌飯，醬料自己加，鹹淡自己決定

但豬腳跟韓國當地吃的差好多，個人不太推","On the whole, the good Korean family restaurant, diverse side dishes, can be continued!

Recommended item:

Roasted pigs, the roasting is just right, delicious ʕ • ᴥ • ʔ
Bibimbap, add the sauce by itself, and decide on the salty yourself

But the pig's heels are almost very much eating in South Korea, but the individual is not too pushing."
"烘蛋下面有燒焦（臭火焦）、所以苦味好重，有點可惜、因為焦味上升影響到上面的蛋也會有焦味。

炸雞好吃、搭配上年糕很喜歡、會想再點～
海鮮煎餅好吃、放量足夠、會吃得很開心。
石鍋拌飯好吃、有疙瘩更有口感～
魚板湯也很好、魚板很軟嫩、湯會讓人想要續碗、一口接一口、但喝到後面會覺得有點鹹。

小菜可以無限續（印象中）

服務有待加強、可能也靠近下班時間、有一些東西沒有給齊全、正好人少會找不到人。另外雖然作為沒有明顯的髒污、但是環境中感覺有種黏膩感、就是很像廚房的食物的焦油（抽油煙不夠強）、然後一開始被帶位的椅子還壞掉（會左右搖晃掀起來那種）

另外看到一個很可怕的個人感受，因為加高、廚房設計樓中樓，看到下面是廚房、但是走上樓梯區取貨什麼的、我都在想會不會灰塵鞋子灰掉進食物裡面…（自行斟酌評估）","There is a burnt (smelly burnt) under the roasted egg, so the bitterness is so heavy. It is a pity that it will also have a scorching flavor because of the rise in the rising flavor.

Fried chicken is delicious, I like it with rice cakes, I will want to order it again ~
Seafood pancakes are delicious, have enough measurement, and they will be very happy.
The stone pot bibimbap is delicious, and there is more taste ~
The fish plate soup is also very good, the fish plate is soft and tender, the soup makes people want to renew the bowl, take a bite, but it will feel a little salty after drinking it.

Small dishes can be continued indefinitely (impressive)

The service needs to be strengthened, it may be close to the time of get off work, there are some things that are not fully given, and there are fewer people who will not find people.In addition, although there is no obvious dirt, it feels sticky in the environment, just like the caramel of the food in the kitchen (not strong enough to smoke the smoke), and then the chair that is brought at first That's the kind)

In addition, I saw a very terrible personal feeling, because the high and the middle building of the kitchen design building, seeing the kitchen below, but going to the stairs area to pick up the goods, I wondered if the dust shoes will fall into the food into the food. … (Evaluate by yourself)"
"馬鈴薯燉排骨湯$880
排骨真的很大塊！而且燉的很軟嫩，裡面還有我喜歡的韓式冬粉和金針菇，看起來紅咚咚的以為很辣，但只是辣在外表而已，份量很多的這鍋適合多人分享

洛杉機牛小排$480
附生菜的帶骨牛小排，吃起來帶著一點微甜的味道，配菜還有蔬菜跟大蒜，很是豐富

馬鈴薯煎餅$320 🆕
這道是蠻令人驚艷的新商品，因為平常都是吃海鮮煎餅，第一次吃馬鈴薯煎餅，金黃色的薯絲吃起來很酥脆，裡面還有起司，是小孩最喜歡的一道菜

蜂蜜柚子氣泡$120
吃韓式料理感覺就要來杯飲料，蜂蜜柚子氣泡水酸酸甜甜的味道，我喜歡

—個人意見—
✅此次雖然沒點幾道菜，但是份量都不小，加上小菜還可以免費續，飽到一個不行，缺點大概就是菜的盤子都不小再加上瓦斯爈跟小菜，桌面稍嫌擁擠，但食物整體美味都不錯，適合一家人或朋友聚餐可以吃的很盡興","Potato stewed bone soup $ 880
Pork ribs are really big!And the stew is very soft, there are Korean -style winter powder and enoki mushrooms that I like. It looks like it is very spicy, but it is only spicy.

Loshi Machine Niu Xiao Pan $ 480
The bone beef steak of the attached lettuce has a slightly sweet taste. The side dishes and vegetables and garlic are rich.

Potato pancake $ 320 🆕
This is a pretty stunning new product, because I usually eat seafood pancakes. For the first time, I ate potato pancakes. The golden potato shreds are crispy and there are cheese.

Honey grapefruit bubble $ 120
If you feel Korean -style dishes, you will have a cup of drink.

- Personal opinion-
道 Although there are not a few dishes this time, the portion is not small. In addition, the small dishes can be continued for free. , But the food is delicious as a whole, suitable for a family or friends to eat dinner and eat very well."
名字起很好 環境不錯 但是真的不好吃！！！味道不正宗 口味可能見仁見智吧 但我們點了海鮮煎餅 炸雞 烘蛋 就連小菜每個都不好吃就真的有點過分,"The name is very good, the environment is good, but it is really not delicious!IntersectionIntersectionThe taste is not authentic. You may see the wisdom, but we ordered the seafood pancake fried chicken and roasted eggs."
"服務員超好的！幫我地諗優惠嘅點餐方式！🥰
當月壽星，送魚板湯or辣炒年糕😘
佢地嘅食用承器/碗好似有特別隔熱設計，唔會燙手。","The waiter is super good!Help me think about orderings!🥰
The month birthday, free fish board soupor spicy fried year cake😘
Its edible supporter/bowls seem to have a special insulation design that doesn’t scald their hands."
"主餐肯瓊奶油雞肉麵的雞肉很嫩
漢堡配餐的薯條是最好吃的炸物

加點炸物的品質跟想像有段差距，雞翅非常乾，花枝圈很油麵衣跟花枝分離","The chicken with the main meal Kenqiong cream chicken noodles is very tender
The fries of the burger meals are the best fried fried objects

There is a gap between the quality of the fryer and the imagination. The chicken wings are very dry."
每人有底消$350，小菜可以免費續，口感偏甜味道一般般，韓式拌飯也普普通通，飯太軟且有點油，韓式炸雞搭配秘製特醬，炸雞外酥肉質啾喜，醬的表現遜色一點並沒有為炸雞加分.飲料的部分是瓶裝喔！,"Each person has a bottom -up $ 350, the side dishes can be continued for free, the taste is sweet, Korean bibimbap is also common, the rice is too soft and a bit oily, Korean fried chicken with a secret special sauce, fried chicken crispy meaty meat quality现 表, the performance of the sauce is inferior to the fried chicken. The part of the drink is a bottle!"
"點了部隊鍋加炸雞 兩個人吃很飽
炸雞甜甜辣辣的 肉嫩嫩的 好吃
部隊鍋也好吃 只是午餐肉煮一下就太軟了有點不喜歡
星期六晚上來的 人很多 建議可以先訂位","Ordered the troops pot and fried chicken.
The sweet and spicy meat of fried chicken is delicious and delicious
The troops are also delicious, but the meat of lunch is too soft and I don’t like it.
Many people who come on Saturday night can make binding seats first"
"平常日錯開用餐時間過來比較有位子坐，用餐時間滿席，且客人坐得都偏久。
食物口味有韓式家常菜的風格，調理醬料不是外面連鎖餐廳的又甜又鹹口味，乍一入口有驚艷感。
石鍋飯口味也較淡，需要重口味可請服務人員另外加醬料，石鍋夠熱時間控制得好可以輕鬆拌出鍋巴。
辣炒年糕淡辣不甜，配料豐富份量不大，點來當小菜吃也剛剛好。
海鮮煎餅的餅體也不會太甜不死鹹，嚐得出滿滿餡料的鮮味，相當有誠意。
雖說餐點單價不低，但考量到這個地段的房價，配合充滿誠意的料理，可以說是物有所值。建議喜歡韓式料理的朋友可以來試試。
唯二有點扣分的地方：1. 店內沒人的時候坐下來就可以看到桌面上沒擦掉的醬料乾，三個外場人員閒著聊天，我自己來吧
2. 小菜可續但服務人員也未告知。","I usually staggered the meal time to come over to sit, and the meal time is full, and the guests have been sitting for a long time.
The taste of food has the style of Korean -style home -style cooked dishes. Conditioning sauce is not the sweet and salty flavor of the restaurant outside. At first glance, it has a stunning feeling.
The flavor of the stone pot is also lighter. You need to be heavy flavor to ask the service personnel to add sauce. The hot time of the stone pot is well controlled. You can easily mix out the pot.
The spicy fried rice cakes are not sweet, the ingredients are rich in weight, and it is just right to order as a side dish.
The body of the seafood pancakes will not be too sweet and not dead and salty. It can taste the umami flavor full of fillings, which is quite sincere.
Although the unit price of meals is not low, considering the housing prices in this area, and with sincere dishes, it can be said that it is worth it.It is recommended that friends who like Korean cuisine can try it.
The only place where there are a little deduction: 1. When there is no one in the store, you can see the sauce that is not wiped off on the table.
2. The side dishes can be continued but the service staff is not informed."
"火烤牛小排⋯不錯吃
海鮮煎餅⋯有點油
烤肉石鍋拌飯（牛）⋯也可以
魚卵起士蛋捲⋯還好
韓式魚板湯⋯也還好😅","Fire roasted beef steak ... good food
Seafood pancakes are a bit oily
Bibimbap (beef) of barbecue stones

Korean fish plate soup is also okay 😅"
"先說結論：#菜色吃不出老闆是韓國人的道地感 #店員都帥哥美女
點餐時段：週一18：30
候位時間：有預約不用等(用餐期滿桌率70%)

以下為此次點餐的品項及價格🔻
🔺三人套餐 $1580
部隊鍋：泡菜湯頭偏不辣，有豆腐、起司泡麵、午餐肉、德腸、火腿、年糕，起司泡麵只有一塊，以為多人分食會多，韓國豆腐真的都很好吃，年糕切薄片，加工肉都表現不錯
醃烤豬梅花：不用自己烤好舒服🥰烤的嫩香，一大盤配上洋蔥還算解油膩
爆炸陶鍋蛋：底下都燒焦的，是溫控沒掌握好？北村比較好吃
烤肉石鍋拌飯：韓式必吃的拌飯，把自己喜歡的小菜和著辣醬一起拌勻，還不錯吃！

🔺輪流請客海鮮煎餅 $380
切法跟月亮蝦餅不一樣是切方格狀，挺大塊的，4-6人分著吃試味道還ok，不能吃多油耗味重，特製沾醬酸甜可以解膩。內料有魷魚、蝦仁、花枝等常見海鮮料，再加上紅蘿蔔和蔥段，麵糊類似大阪燒軟糊

🔺蔬食雜菜 $270
粗冬粉拌上豆芽菜、菠菜和紅胡蔔，再灑上白芝麻，因為吃過好市多的冷凍雜菜點來回味，結果挺失望的，冬粉糾結在一起不夠味，配料跟冬粉沒交集各自表述

🔺辣炒魚板
沒有很夠味，魚板跟年糕沒有很吸湯汁

有六種韓式小菜可以免費無限享用～
當天吃到魚板、豆芽、涼拌黃瓜、鳥蛋、韓式泡菜、醃蘿蔔，讓我不禁跟北村做比較，北村好吃多了😅
整體料理吃起來沒有一道有記憶點或是令人驚艷，攤下來人均700元真的不便宜，是吃的很飽但沒有吃到會點頭的滿足感
內用需加一成服務費，店員服務都很優良勤快。桌子太小，應該擺桌子就要考慮菜色是需要用到很多盤子，再放個瓦斯爐真的相當擠，用餐品質沒有說很好","Let's talk about the conclusion first: #先 先 ： ： 先 is the authentic feeling of Koreans
Ordering time: Monday 18:30
Waiting time: There is no need to wait for an appointment (70%at full table rate at the meal period)

The following is the item and price of this order 🔻
15 Three -person package $ 1580
Troops: Kimchi soup is not spicy, with tofu, cheese instant noodles, lunch meat, virtue, ham, rice cakes, cheese instant noodles, thinking that many people will eat more, Korean tofu is really delicious , Rice cake cut slices, processing meat is good
Pickled pork plum blossoms: No need to roast it by yourself, comfortable and tender fragrance, a large plate with onion is still greasy
Explosive pottery pot eggs: The underneath is burnt, is the temperature control not mastered well?Beicun is more delicious
Bibimbap of barbecue stone pot: Bibimbap must be eaten in Korean, mixing your favorite side dishes with hot sauce, it is not bad!

鲜 鲜 🔺 🔺 🔺 🔺 🔺 🔺 $ 380
The cut method is not the same as the moon shrimp cake. It is quite large. It is quite large. 4-6 people are also ok with a trial taste. You ca n’t eat more fuel consumption.There are common seafood materials such as squid, shrimp, and flower branches in the inside, plus carrots and green onions, batter similar to Osaka roasted soft paste

Vegetables and Miscellaneous vegetables $ 270
Rough winter powder is mixed with bean sprouts, spinach and red beaches, and then sprinkled with white sesame seeds, because I have eaten a lot of frozen and miscellaneous vegetables, the result is very disappointed. Do not submit their respective expressions

🔺 Spicy fried fish plate
There is no taste enough, the fish plate and rice cakes are not very sucking soup

There are six Korean side dishes to enjoy free and infinitely ~
Eat fish plates, bean sprouts, cucumbers, bird eggs, Korean kimchi, and pickled radish that day, which made me compare with Beicun.
There is no memory point or amazing in the overall cuisine. It is really not cheap to spread the per capita per capita.
Internal use needs to be added to the service fee, and the clerk's service is very good and diligent.The table is too small, you should consider that the dishes need to be used for a lot of plates, and then a gas stove is really crowded. The quality of the meal is not good."
"點了個石鍋拌飯，還有魚板。
味道中規中矩，但石鍋拌飯沒有很燙，魚板也是溫溫的。

感覺就不是很好，如果只是解決一餐，倒是沒問題，對於想好好吃一餐的要考慮一下。","Ordered a stone pot bibimbap and a fish plate.
The taste is satisfactory, but the stone pot bibimbap is not very hot, and the fish plate is warm.

It doesn't feel good. If you just solve a meal, it is okay. For those who want to eat a good meal."
和朋友經過想說吃看看，點了兩人份的套餐，雖然不是很道地點韓式但石鍋拌飯蠻有味道，比較失望的是小菜（免費可以續，口味可能和我想像的比較不同）和部隊鍋（湯頭清淡比較像是永配菜加高湯煮麵🥹） …,"After looking at it with friends, I ordered the package of two people. Although it is not very Korean, the stone pot bibimbap is quite delicious. Different) with the troops (the soup is light, it is more like a permanent dishes and a broth to cook noodles) ..."
好吃，兩個人有點吃太多,"It's delicious, two people eat too much"
餐點都還蠻不錯吃，價錢偏中高，附近停車也方便，整體來說還算蠻推薦,"The meals are pretty good, the price is high, it is convenient to park nearby, and it is quite recommended overall"
小菜份量多可續，起司魚卵烘蛋捲包覆滿滿的起司，韓式醬燒肉含洋蔥的香甜以及生菜的爽脆很美味，海鮮煎餅料多外皮煎得很酥脆好吃。,The amount of side dishes can be continued. The cheese egg -roasted egg rolls are covered with cheese. Korean sauce roast meat contains the sweetness of onions and the crispy and delicious lettuce. The seafood pancakes are fried and delicious.
菜色都蠻道地的口味，小菜可以無限續，泡菜和牛蒡都超級好吃！石鍋拌飯加上泡菜之後會更有味道，值得推薦！,"The dishes are quite well -existent. The side dishes can be continued infinitely. Kimchi and cattle are super delicious!The stone pot bibimbap will be more flavorful after adding kimchi, it is worth recommending!"
價格便宜量多好吃，小菜吃不夠可以一直續，但只能付現金或刷卡,"The price is cheap, how delicious the amount is, the side dishes can not be continued, but you can only pay cash or swipe your card"
"韓式醬燒鍋×湯很清甜
可能裡面一半以上都是洋蔥吧🤣
冬粉很Q  整體吃到後面偏普

馬鈴薯辣燉雞×單吃他的辣醬還不錯
馬鈴薯、雞、年糕 完全沒有入味

小菜可以續，只有沙拉玉米好吃
泡菜不酸也不辣

"店內環境乾淨，但座位大多是四位，且坐長板凳，坐久不是很舒服。
石鍋拌飯不錯吃，自行趁熱拌飯，會有一點鍋巴，口味還不錯。但發現店員幫隔壁桌的客人拌飯，就覺得有點失落。是說自己拌也不錯。可能隔壁桌有妹子。
海鮮煎餅比較軟，切成小方塊，適合分食。
馬鈴薯排骨湯，蠻辣的，馬鈴薯和排骨都燉得很軟，但有碎骨，吃的時候要小心。鍋類價位也比較高，份量不小，適合四人以上分食，點餐時自己要衡量一下。
用餐時間90分鐘，而且就算店內沒有客滿也會趕人，這點讓我們不是很開心。但店家規則還是尊重。","The environment in the store is clean, but most of the seats are four, and they are not very comfortable to sit for a long time.
The stone pot bibimbap is good, and the bibimbap will have a little pot, and the taste is not bad.However, I found that the clerk helped the guests next to the table and felt a little lost.That is to say, it is also good to mix.Maybe there are girls next to the table.
Seafood pancakes are relatively soft and cut into small squares, suitable for food separation.
Potato pork rib soup is quite spicy. Both potatoes and pork ribs are stewed soft, but there are broken bones. Be careful when you eat.The price of the pot is also relatively high, and the portion is not small. It is suitable for more than four people to eat. It is necessary to measure it when ordering.
The meal time is 90 minutes, and even if the store is not full, it will catch people, which makes us not very happy.But the rules of the store still respect."
"點了三人套餐，四個人吃的很飽
小菜跟生菜都能免費續，真的超佛心👍
店員也很都熱心的介紹與服務
打卡還有送魚板喔！","Ordered a three -person package, and the four people were very full
Both side dishes and lettuce can be continued for free, really super Buddha heart 👍
The clerk also enthusiastically introduces and services
Pickup and send fish plates!"
"服務：上來這邊評論，才發現小菜可以續，但服務員沒告知，所以感覺不太好
氣氛：平日下午到店用餐，明顯主打商業午餐，有用餐時間限制也只有商業午餐套餐選擇
餐點：這部分算是比較失望的，跟期待落差很大，小菜部分普普通通，蒟蒻部分不太討喜，多人來用餐也都是同樣的搭配，韓式最經典的部隊鍋，湯頭也不到位，內容物也很少，沒什麼誠意，畢竟部隊鍋是沒有肉品的
應該是不會再來了","Services: Comment here to comment, only to find that the side dishes can be continued, but the waiter did not inform, so it feels not very good
Atmosphere: On the afternoon of the afternoon, I have dinner in the afternoon. Obviously the main business lunch, there is a time limit for meals and only commercial lunch sets.
Meal: This part is relatively disappointed. It is very different from the expectation of the expectation. The part of the side dishes is common. If you are not in place, there are very few contents, and there is no sincerity. After all, the troops have no meat.
It should not come again"
服務不錯，小菜給六個，還可以續吃！小缺點是進去左邊的座位有背對背椅子，後面人碰撞就覺得坐起來不是很舒服,"The service is good, the side dishes are given six, and you can also eat it!The small disadvantage is that there are back chairs on the left seat on the left."
點了牛腱雪濃湯，就是因為想喝湯才點的但送來就只剩下一堆膨脹又粗的冬粉！！！想問基本這種會吸湯的都會分開放為什麼不分開放呢？一打開的時候很傻眼！！我還有點辣炒豬肉丼飯！一點紅都沒見到想問我的辣呢？還點了將近快700塊,"I ordered beef tendon snow soup, because I wanted to drink soup, but only a bunch of swollen and thick winter powder was left!IntersectionIntersectionI want to ask why the basic one will be open to soup is not open?I was dumbfounded when I opened it!IntersectionI still have a bit of spicy fried pork rice rice!I didn't see the spicyness I wanted to ask me at all?I also ordered almost 700 yuan"
"平日晚上六點用餐空間舒適
兩個人點雙人套餐
小菜好吃，泡菜還蠻酸的
不喜吃酸的人可能吃不了
贈送的魚板串很好吃
泡菜五花豬雖然是中鍋
但兩個人吃還是太多
希望晚上也可以有個人的餐點或小鍋
不然晚餐比較適合人多來分食
還有室內空調真的不行
吃鍋超級熱～～～","The room for meal at 6 pm is comfortable
Two people order a double set meal
The side dishes are delicious, kimchi is quite sour
People who don't like sour may not eat
The gift of fish plate skewers are delicious
Although kimchi pork pork pig is a medium pot
But two people still eat too much
I hope there can be personal meals or small pots at night
Otherwise dinner is more suitable for people to eat more
And indoor air conditioners are really not enough
Eating a pot is super hot ~~~"
"跟同事一同去用餐，我點了辣炒豬肉，整盤菜裡面只找到兩塊勉強看得出肉片形狀的肉，其他全都像盤子裡面的小碎肉，根本就是用邊角料做的，旁邊員工吃的員工餐肉明顯大塊很多而且很完整。

口味也不太行，明明是辣炒豬，結果口味甜的讓人懷疑。

餐廳服務部分，從入座的拉椅子、倒水全都是自己來，連點餐也是用QR code點餐，完全沒有被服務到，到底為什麼要收服務費？

菜單上寫說小菜跟湯品可以無限續，但服務人員也完全沒告知該如何續餐。","Go to dinner with my colleagues, I ordered spicy stir -fried pork. Only two pieces of meat that barely can see the shape of the meat in the whole dish. The others are all small minced meat in the plate. Employees are obviously large and complete.

The taste is not very good, it is obviously spicy fried pigs, but the taste is skeptical.

The restaurant service section comes from the seats and pouring water. Even the order of ordering is to order with QR Code. It is not served at all. Why should I charge a service fee?

The menu says that the side dishes and soups can be continued indefinitely, but the service staff did not tell how to renew the meal at all."
"看了部落客推薦來吃，果然部落客推薦大部份都是……
當天點了雙人套餐跟單點炸雞，第一次吃韓式料理吃的這麼不開心

魚卵石鍋飯－不知道是不是鍋子不夠熱，完全做不出石鍋飯的鍋巴，裡面的醬料也不是韓國的甜辣醬料。 雪獄山的都比這裡好吃
韓式醬燒豬肉－很像比較貴的熱炒100的炒豬肉
部隊鍋－味道還可以，唯一比較接近韓式口味的菜色。 但是料不多而且都是便宜的食材要價600很誇張
單點半半炸雞－吃到快結束了才上桌，一度覺得被遺忘，一上桌後馬上失望。 單看外觀就完全不想吃。 雞皮跟肉是分開的，入口很油。 沒有像NEME那樣處理的乾爽。並且雞肉是完全沒味道的，不是過醃後下去炸。
附的兩個醬 一個是椒鹽粉（原味）一個是奇怪的酸甜醬（祕製）沾哪個都無法拯救這極難吃的炸雞. 後來打包外帶沒附醬料

還有一個小插曲：附近座位的阿姨一入座就跟工作人員反應頭上會滴水，結果員工只是回應說：喔因為如何如何；所以水管怎樣怎樣，才會滴水（沒聽清楚）
為什麼客人反應頭上會滴水,員工只是解釋,沒有要換座位？？（沒有客滿，還有其他空位）
一直到過了大概5分鐘，才有另一個店員過來請阿姨換位子

主打「道地韓式料理」保證口味一定韓，但是除了免費的小菜有點韓味，今天吃的菜說實在根本沒有一樣有韓式口味。 在韓國吃過再難吃的料理都沒有這餐失望。餐點味道真的有用心調製嗎?
而且cp值非常不高，這樣的價位在梨谷可以吃的很開心,在北投阿里郎可以吃兩頓非常飽。","After watching bloggers recommending to eat, it really is ...
On the same day, I ordered a double set meal and a single -order fried chicken. The first time I ate Korean cuisine so unhappy

Fish Mattop Rice -I don't know if the pot is not hot enough. It can't make a pot of pot rice. The sauce inside is not a sweet and spicy sauce in Korea.Snow Prison Mountain is better than here
Korean sauce -roasted pork -very similar to the more expensive stir -fry 100 fried pork
The troops pot -taste is okay, the only dish is closer to Korean flavor.But there are not many and all cheap ingredients. The price is 600 very exaggerated
One and a half -half fried chicken -I got on the table until the end was over, and I felt forgotten for a while.Just look at the appearance and don't want to eat at all.Chicken skin is separated from meat, and the entrance is very oily.There is no drying like NEME.And the chicken is completely flavorful, not frying after being pickled.
One of the two sauce with one of the salt and pepper powder (original), one is a strange sweet and sour sauce (secret).

There is also a small episode: the aunt in the nearby seat reacts with the staff when she enters the seat. As a result, the employee only responds to: Oh, what is because of the water pipe, so what is the water pipe, and the water will be dripping (not clearly hear)
Why does the guest react to the water, and the employees just explain that they have not wanted to change their seats?Intersection(No full, there are other vacancies)
It wasn't until about 5 minutes, and another clerk came to ask the aunt to change the seat.

The main ""duct Korean cuisine"" guarantees that the taste must be Korean, but except for free side dishes, it is a bit Korean. The dishes that are eaten today have no Korean flavor.No matter how unpleasant dishes have been eaten in South Korea, there is no disappointment.Is the meal taste really prepared?
Moreover, the CP value is very low. Such a price can be very happy in Liyu. It can eat two meals in Beitou Ali Lang."

餐點普通，部隊鍋份量很大，但吃多了很膩，炸雞附少量炸年糕，放很久還是很燙，現炸就是好吃。另外位置有點狹窄前後沒有什麼空間。,"The meal is ordinary. The troops are very large, but they are very greasy when they eat too much. The fried chicken attached a small amount of fried rice cakes. It is still hot for a long time.In addition, there is no space before and after the position is a bit narrow."
燈光美，氣氛佳，是約會首選的好地方，我們是假日先預約用餐，點了人參雞湯內容物有精選春雞、高麗人蔘、紅棗及獨家秘方香料，湯頭鮮甜可口機也入口即化還算蠻道地的，輪流請客煎餅厚度也很實在，搭配醬料及泡菜吃很讚！還有韓式醬燒鍋滿滿一盤肉＋油蔥還有冬粉甜而不膩！還點了稻香煙燻五豬花肉＋松阪豬＋火烤牛小排這些肉排有店家是先幫忙烤好很好吃搭配生菜小菜醬料真的很道地的感覺！還有明太子魚卵烘蛋這道料理是我第一次吃上桌時還冒著煙很新奇切開後很好吃真是賞心悅目的一到菜！最後點了石鍋拌飯(豬)服務生會幫忙拌好食用起來方便很多味道也是很令人讚不絕口！最後加點了阿里山金萱烏龍茶＋梨山蜜香紅茶這２湖茶都可以回沖很適合跟長輩一起去的時候點來喝唷！整體來說算是很不錯的地方！只是服務生似乎很忙要多叫幾次摟！,"The lights and good atmosphere are the first choice for date. We make an appointment for dining first on holidays. It is quite pretty, and the thickness of the pancakes in turns is also very real. It is very good to eat with sauce and kimchi!There are also Korean sauce boiled pots full of meat + shallots and winter powder sweet but not greasy!I also ordered rice smoked five pork flowers + Matsusaka pigs + fire roasted beef steaks. These meat rows have shops to help bake first.There is also the dish of the prince fish egg -roasted egg. This is the first time that I have eaten at the table. It ’s very novel when I am smoky. It’ s delicious. It ’s a pleasing dish!Finally, the waiter of the stone pot bibimbap (pig) will help mix well and eat it.

"我們點的是「雙人套餐」吃好飽

內料給得蠻大方👍  還很扎實

再來推薦No.2「部隊鍋」

麵量超多 午餐肉/香腸/豆腐也給蠻多
怎麼吃都吃不完🤣 煮到最後變得有點鹹

還有還有 這間的小菜都很讚

一次上六碗 免費提供 製作也不馬虎","We ordered the ""double set meal"" to eat well

Pushing them in turn, please pancake
The slight thickness is not very much like eating flour
The internal is very generous 很 is still very solid

Let's recommend NO.2 ""Army Pot""
Add the pose 下️ to go down to become superb
Noodles are more than lunch meat/sausage/tofu.
I ca n’t eat it after eating 到 Cook until the end it becomes a bit salty

And this side dish is very good
Everyway is a bowl
It is not sloppy"
海鮮煎餅還不錯，半半炸雞骨頭多，且只是給沾醬讓人沾，和其他韓式炸雞不一樣，年糕偏硬，沒什麼味道，服務也不好，價位偏高，限制每位低消需350元。,"Seafood pancakes are not bad. There are many fried chicken bones, and they just give people dipping sauce. Unlike other Korean fried chicken, the rice cakes are hard, there is no taste, the service is not good, the price is too high, the restrictions are low -elimination. It takes 350 yuan."
"我們是來幫好友慶生，真的很慶幸選擇這間店來和好友聚餐，覺得帶朋友來吃的我很有面子，大家留下美好的回憶 :)

服務人員態度也很良好😊","There is a paid parking lot next to it ~ very convenient

"用輪流請客自己網站點的外送（3km內滿$1000免運費）
（價格比food panda便宜個30-40，就是真的店內價）

點了一個雙人套餐（加上加價的副餐共$1009），這樣份量其實很多！
口味上大致都不錯，就是炒肉的部分肉感覺沒有炒開，一次夾起來就是一大坨，不是很好食用。
還有泡菜鍋的部分，有泡菜味，但蠻不辣的，不吃辣的可以考慮，但吃辣的也要考慮（真的不太辣）
輪流請客煎餅（應該是海鮮煎餅）還不錯，可能外送會導致沒那麼脆，但整體吃起來還是ok的（這道單點算是最貴的要$350）

---------------------
2022年年初到店內再訪，但好像菜色有所更動，覺得看著沒這麼吸引人，吃起來大概就是3-4顆星之間吧","Take the delivery of your own website (3km within 3km for $ 1000 free shipping)
(The price is 30-40 cheaper than Food Panda, which is the real store price)

Ordered a double set meal (plus $ 1009 with the price increase), so the amount is actually a lot!
The taste is roughly good, that is, the meat of the fried meat feels not stir -fry, and it is a big cricket at a time, not very good.
There are also kimchi pot, with kimchi flavor, but it is not spicy. Those who do not eat spicy can be considered, but those who eat spicy food should also be considered (really not too spicy)
Ting turns to make pancakes (should be seafood pancakes) are not bad. It may cause that the delivery will cause not that crispy, but the overall taste is still OK (this single point is the most expensive to be $ 350)

-----------------------
I visited the store in early 2022, but it seemed that the dishes were even more moved. I felt that it was not so attractive to look at it. It was probably between 3-4 stars?"
"六道前菜小菜精緻好吃，本人最喜歡馬鈴薯.小朋友喜歡玉米沙啦。
魚卵石鍋拌飯蠻特別也好吃，另外一個石鍋拌飯，
感覺一定要加店內附的韓式辣醬比較有味道，
海鮮煎餅超級料多美味也蠻厚的，有沒有加附醬都好吃耶，小孩吃了3塊～ 真的必點！！！
辣炒年糕的醬可以～ 下次再看看能不能煮軟一點....
但烤肉盤真的太硬太韌⋯⋯ 年輕人吃起來都有點吃力；
老人家一個都咬不動； 小朋友更不用說了一一
有機會下次想試試韓式辣雞～整體口味不會很重蠻可以的。","Six front dishes are delicate and delicious. I like potatoes the most. Children like corn sand.
The bibimbap of fish pebbuts is quite delicious, another stone pot bibimbap,

韓式醬燒肉份量十足，剛炒好的熱燙好吃，小菜跟菜色很適合給幼童同食，是親子友善餐廳，下次會再來訪，但記得提前三小時預定人蔘雞湯，這次沒喝到,"Korean sauce roasted meat is full of weight, the just fried hot hot and hot, small dishes and dishes are very suitable for young children, it is a parent -child friendly restaurant. I will visit again next time, but remember to book the chicken soup for three hours in advance. This I didn’t drink it the second time"
假日排隊人很多，打電話說要到八點才有位子，但六點多到現場等候大概七點左右就有位子，一個人低消350，沒有350小菜不能續，但說實在小菜不是很好吃！涼拌小黃瓜和海帶酸到不行，第一次看到韓式小菜有蛋沙拉（很想叫兩片吐司來當早餐？）我觀察菜口大多數人只會再續泡菜（也不知道是不是現成的泡菜），我們唯一想繼續吃的也只有泡菜。我們兩個人只想吃點烤肉，不想吃鍋，所以只點海鮮煎餅和烤五花肉，兩個人吃份量剛剛好。烤五花肉的五花肉還不錯，旁邊的配菜應該是先備好，沒有回烤所以是冷的，生菜不能續所以要省著吃。海鮮煎餅很不錯！料很實在！如果不需要排隊等候下次可能還會再來，但如果要等很久就不建議特地來，希望小菜的調味可以改善耶！,"There are a lot of people in line on holidays, and they will not have a seat until eight o'clock, but when you go to the scene at about 6 o'clock, there will be a seat at about 7 o'clock.

"口味一般，石鍋拌飯中的紅蘿蔔生味有點重，海鮮豆腐鍋花枝不太新鮮。
用餐到一半時突然有小強跑到桌上，差點跑進食物中🤮，又四處跑到桌下、椅子、裙子及牆上，向店員反應後回覆可更換新餐點，但已無食慾便婉拒，之後有另位店員至餐桌旁看了幾眼後便離開。
後續直至結帳店家未再有其他表示及處理方案，連一句道歉的話都沒有。","The taste is average, the raw flavor of the carrot in the stone pot is a bit heavy, and the flower branches of seafood tofu pot are not fresh.

裝潢很漂亮的韓式餐廳，小菜很好吃，安東燉雞有點甜，海鮮煎餅中規中矩，CP值不太高。,"Korean restaurants with beautiful decoration, the side dishes are delicious, Anton stewed chicken is a bit sweet, seafood pancakes are quite satisfactory, and the CP value is not too high."
新潮時髦的韓式料理店，套餐的份量有點過多，兩人套餐可以給三道四個人吃，價位也算是中上，整體還算不錯。,"The trendy and fashionable Korean restaurant, the amount of the package is a bit too much. The two -person package can be eaten for three and four people. The price is also the middle and the overall."
一個人用餐，點了一個海鮮煎餅，店員還是給了六樣韓式小菜，小菜味道上都做的很到位，很好吃！ 自然而然海鮮煎餅的味道也是很美味，一個人吃不完整份煎餅，後來打包還給了一份醬，算是很貼心！有機會會想要再來🎉 …,"When I dine alone, I ordered a seafood pancake. The clerk still gave six Korean side dishes.

Soft and dual taste on the pancake
The best choice of spicy fried squid pork pork pork flowering obstacles
Since there is a partition inconvenient to divide the food
The store is very intimate to divide the meals into two copies
Although Coca -Cola from the watermelon soda is vulgar
The service staff laughed loudly
But I hope everyone can survive this epidemic"
餐點口味還好，小菜普普，沒有附飲料，只有一瓶常溫水隨桌附上。馬鈴薯燉雞肉的馬鈴薯真的很少，幾乎吃不到，如果以一個人午餐$249加10%服務費這個價位來看，可能餐點要更提昇，才會讓人想要再次光顧，因為現在店裡的裝潢比餐點精彩,"The taste of the meal is okay, the side dishes, there are no drinks, only one bottle of warm water is attached to the table.马铃薯炖鸡肉的马铃薯真的很少，几乎吃不到，如果以一个人午餐$249加10%服务费这个价位来看，可能餐点要更提升，才会让人想要再次光顾，因为现在店The decoration in it is more exciting than the meal"
"因應疫情，戴口罩，勤洗手，保持社交距離。
2022／08／30首次造訪該店家。
之前都是去大坪林分店，因為餐後想去內湖逛街，因此選擇這家餐廳。結果是～還是大坪林店的感覺，口味比較讓我們喜歡，雖然可能連鎖店菜色口味都會有固定做法及配方，但這次內湖店無論小菜，主食都讓我們滿失望的。
點了豬肉石鍋拌飯239元，豬五花肉泡菜鍋239元，韓式魚板兩串80元。
首先小菜醃小黃瓜酸，口味普通，泡菜正常，涼拌魚板普通。
韓式魚板整個是涼的？是本來就吃冷的？泡菜鍋的老泡菜覺得有點酸過頭了～整體太酸太鹹。石鍋拌飯本身味道好吃，但～～底下的油太多了，吃完還有殘留一堆油，石鍋本身也不夠熱，鍋巴不足。
總結這家分店的整體感受不好，下次還是去新店分店。","In response to the epidemic, wearing a mask, washing your hands frequently, and maintaining a social distance.
2022/08/30 visited the store for the first time.
I used to go to Dapinglin Branch before. Because I wanted to go shopping in Neihu after a meal, I chose this restaurant.The result is the feeling of the Dapinglin store. The taste makes us like it. Although there may be a fixed method and formula in the flavor of the chain store, the staple food in the Neihu Store is disappointed.
Ordered 239 yuan for pork stone pot bibimbap, 239 yuan for pork pork belly, and 80 yuan for Korean fish plates.
First of all, the pickled cucumber is acidic, the taste is ordinary, the kimchi is normal, and the cold fish plate is ordinary.
Korean fish plate is cold?Is it cold?The old kimchi in the kimchi pot feels a bit sour ~ The overall is too sour and salty.The stone pot bibimbap itself tastes delicious, but the oil below is too much, there is still a bunch of oil after eating, the stone pot itself is not hot enough, and the pot is insufficient.
To sum up the overall feelings of this branch, I will go to the new store branch next time."
口味很好，中午有商業套餐滿實惠,"The taste is very good, there is a business package at noon"
很好吃，點三人套餐，份量比想像中多，吃很飽！服務人員都蠻客氣的，小菜六種可以續，不辣的選擇也不少，小朋友也吃得很滿意😊 …,"Very delicious, order a three -person package, the portion is more than expected, and you are full!The service staff are very polite. Six small dishes can be continued. There are many choices that are not spicy. Children are also very satisfied with ..."
"雖說是因為五星送蜂巢瑪格麗才評的
但是小菜都很好吃！還可以無限續，包含羅美生菜🥬！
用餐環境不會很吵鬧，大家都吃鍋物但是味道不會很重，目前覺得還不錯👌
今天點的是三人套餐，包含一個鍋、主餐、副餐和飲料，雖然沒有蛋的副餐稍嫌可惜，但是整體還不錯👍","Although it was commented because the five -star sent the honeycomb Margaret
But the side dishes are delicious!It can also be continued, including Luo Meilua!
The dining environment will not be very noisy. Everyone eats a pot but it will not taste very heavy. At present, I think it is not bad.
Today I ordered a three -person package, including a pot, main meal, auxiliary meal, and drink. Although the sideline without eggs is a pity, it is not bad."
"在中午用餐時段最好要先電話訂位，想現場等的話都可能要等20-30分鐘。

馬鈴薯燉辣雞肉適合配飯，辣度普通，小可惜馬鈴薯沒有燉到很爛。
石鍋拌飯穩定發揮，不錯吃。
小菜（泡菜、蘿蔔、海帶絲）都好吃，解膩，續盤肯定要的。","It is best to call the seat first during lunch meals. If you want to wait, you may have to wait 20-30 minutes.

Potato stewed spicy chicken is suitable for rice, and the spicy degree is ordinary. Unfortunately, the potato is not stewed.
The stone pot bibimbap is stable and good.
Small dishes (kimchi, radish, kelp shreds) are delicious, butt, and it must be decomposed."
"以往清蒸豬五花是媽媽的料理，用米酒蒸熟切片食用，香氣口感濃郁。
第一次嘗試韓式風味的清蒸豬五花，五花肉切片口感軟嫩沒有腥味，搭配醃蘿蔔絲或醬料也非常好。

半半炸雞是韓式料理其中一道經典必吃，這次點的是辣醬和秘制醬，外皮爽脆，辣醬是個人比較喜歡的甜辣口味。打包帶回家繼續享用，外皮依舊有脆度。","In the past, steamed pork five flowers was a mother's cooking. It was sliced ​​with rice wine steamed with rice wine. The aroma taste was strong.
For the first time, I tried Korean -style steamed pork pork flowers. The slices of pork belly were soft and tender without fishy smell. It was also very good with pickled radish or sauce.

Half half -fried chicken is one of the classics of Korean cuisine. This time, it is hot sauce and secret sauce. The skin is crispy. The spicy sauce is a sweet and spicy taste that I like.Take it home and continue to enjoy, the outer skin is still crispy."
"一人低消350元有一成服務費，餐廳明亮、高挑，是喜歡的氛圍。
服務人員態度非常好，小菜可以無限續，而且很優秀，每道小菜都非常好吃！(鵪鶉蛋也很入味，印象深刻)
兩人點部隊鍋+泡菜煎餅
部隊鍋湯頭我喜歡，泡菜煎餅有四大塊(原本以為是整片的煎餅)有點油，可是也很好吃(酥脆)
吃不完可以幫忙打包，會再來訪的韓式料理餐廳，推。","A person with a low consumption of 350 yuan has a service fee. The restaurant is bright and tall. It is a favorite atmosphere.
The attitude of the service staff is very good, the side dishes can be continued infinitely, and it is excellent. Each side dish is very delicious!(Quail eggs are also very delicious, impressive)
Two people order troops pot+kimchi pancakes
I like the troops pot soup head. There are four pieces of kimchi pancakes (originally thought that the whole piece of pancake) is a bit oily, but it is also delicious (crispy)
If you ca n’t eat it, you can help pack it."
"明亮現代設計的韓式料理餐廳，假日建議提早定位，樓下有停車場

餐點：兩大兩小的配置，店家提供免費小菜，點了韓式拌飯，生菜包川燙豬五花，海鮮煎餅，韓式炸雞 2000元（含服務費）

來吃過很多次了，餐點採獨立套餐模式，鍋類都很不錯，分量中等，男生吃得飽,"I've been eating many times, the meal is used for the independent package mode, the pot is very good, the weight is medium, and the boys are full"
"看菜單念號碼給店員點餐，店員說：念名字，問號到不行？？請問菜單上寫號碼幹嘛？還有態度很差
一進去說用餐時間一小時，還沒遇過只有一小時的餐廳
東西也不好吃，點的湯類的餐點味道都很單一，百貨公司美食街還比較好吃
完全不推，不解為什麼評分這麼高","Watch the menu thought number to order the shop clerk. The clerk said: ""Can you read the name, can't the question mark?""IntersectionWhat do you do on the menu?There is also a poor attitude
I went in and said that the meal time was one hour, and I haven't met a restaurant for only an hour
Things are not delicious.
Don't push it at all, puzzle why the score is so high"
今天點了石鍋拌飯跟韓式炒年糕與伴雜菜。年糕稍硬，高麗菜偏少；石鍋拌飯中規中矩，小菜亦是。座位偏窄小，超過180的人會顯侷促。,"Today I ordered the stone pot bibimbap and Korean fried rice cakes and accompanying dishes.The rice cakes are slightly harder, and there are fewer cabbage;The seat is narrow, and more than 180 people will be cramped."
"魚板湯喜歡 份量很大兩人套餐可以三個人吃
其他口味都很還好 石鍋拌飯飯很軟也不香 蒸蛋有糙灰搭味 小菜很多但蠻敷衍的 不會想再訪","Fish board soup likes a large amount of weight. The two people can eat three people.
The other flavors are very good. The stone pot is very soft and the steamed egg is not fragrant. There are rough gray and delicious dishes, but it is quite perfunctory. I don’t want to visit it again."
"整理來說還不錯
店面裝潢很好看 乾淨明亮
座位區也不會小，坐起來很舒服，桌面也是
只是衛生紙不好找，要跟店員要😂

小菜總共有六種，誠意十足，超喜歡
每道小菜都不雷，味道都很不錯
泡菜口感偏酸一點

醬燒牛肉鍋
份量算多，裡面還有貌似冬粉的東西
湯頭稍鹹一點整體來說還不錯

海鮮煎餅
外酥內軟，但我太喜歡薄的海鮮煎餅了
所以這個的沒有那麼喜歡，但是仍然完勝內湖一帶的海鮮煎餅！很不錯

辣炒魷魚五花
熱的時候吃非常非常的好吃😋
魷魚很脆口感很有嚼勁
五花肉的厚薄剛好不會感覺老或少

整理來說可以給到4顆星
聚餐很適合的地方","It's not bad for finishing
The store decoration is very beautiful, clean and bright
The seat area will not be small, it is very comfortable to sit up, and the desktop is also
It's just that the toilet paper is not easy to find, I have to ask the clerk

There are a total of six kinds of side dishes, full of sincerity, very much like
Every side dish is not thunderous, the taste is very good
Kimchi mouth is sore

Sauce beef pot
There are many portions, there are things that seem to be winter powder
The soup is a little salty, a little bit pretty good as a whole

So this is not so I like it, but it is still better than the seafood pancakes in Neihu!very nice

Spicy fried squid
It is very, very delicious when you are hot 非常
Squid is crispy and chewy
The thickness of the pork belly will not feel old or less

道地韓國家庭料理美食，第一次來，點了三人分享餐～其實CP值算高，已經夠吃飽了，但為了多嚐試不同餐點，所以另外還有加價＄150牛小排及加點一份海鮮煎餅，最後當然吃不下就打包回去囉～,"道地韩国家庭料理美食，第一次来，点了三人分享餐～其实CP值算高，已经够吃饱了，但为了多尝试不同餐点，所以另外还有加价＄150牛小排及Add a piece of seafood pancake, of course, if you can’t eat it, you can pack it and go back ~"
還不錯吃，小菜可免費續，但2杯檸檬紅茶飲料顏色可差很多覺得傻眼，淡的那杯很難喝...要求把淡的那杯換新的來等很久,"It's not bad, the side dishes can be continued for free, but the color of 2 glasses of lemon black tea is worse. It feels dumbfounded, and the light cup is difficult to drink ... I want to change the light cup for a long time for a long time"
晚上五點沒有訂位臨時去用餐，入桌後就看到三位員工躺在椅子上睡覺，然後我們的桌子是會不平的搖晃。餐點先上辣炒年糕，份量很少也一點都不辣，應該說沒啥味道。第二個是水蒸蛋，口感不是濕潤而是很紮實然後又是沒啥味道。第三個是海鮮煎餅，海鮮給的挺多，但兩面餅皮除了一小角之外，其他都是軟軟的，一口咬下裡面還吃的到濕潤的麵粉糊。第四道是馬鈴薯燉雞，雞很明顯的是肉雞沒有咬勁，馬鈴薯跟紅蘿蔔都沒入味還有生味。看別人寫評論才決定用餐，但四樣料理沒一道是有餐廳等級，非常失望。最後結帳時信用卡機還刷不過，本以為是我卡片的問題，結果櫃檯說這幾天機器就會臨時出狀況......回到家發現刷卡是有刷過的，所以還電話通知店家要刷退！從進餐廳的觀感，桌子的舒適度，餐點的水準到最後付款都出事，真的只能不好意思的給予一顆星！,"At five o'clock in the evening, there was no reservation for a temporary dinner. After entering the table, we saw that three employees were lying on the chair to sleep, and then our table shakes unevenly.The meal is spicy and fried rice cakes.The second is steamed eggs. The taste is not humid, but it is very solid and then it has no taste.The third is seafood pancakes. There are a lot of seafood, but except for a small horn on both sides of the cake skin, the others are soft, and the wet flour paste is eaten in one bite.The fourth is a potato stewed chicken. The chicken is obviously that the chicken is not bitter, the potato and the carrot are not flavored and there is a raw taste.I decided to dine when I saw someone writing comments, but none of the four dishes had a restaurant level and were very disappointed.At the end of the checkout, the credit card machine could not be swiped, but I thought it was the problem of my card. As a result, the counter said that the machine will temporarily go out in the past few days ... When I get home, I found that there is a credit card. The store must be brushed back!From the perspective of entering the restaurant, the comfort of the table, the level of meals to the end of the payment, you can only give a star embarrassed!"
"店名的寓意讓人很難忘
食物擺盤也不錯
就可惜了口味

海鮮煎餅皮太厚料太少太濕！
魚卵拌飯味道不夠明顯
韓式辣豬肉很夠味
不膩且沒豬腥味♥️

然後安東燉雞的味道
很像便當店的滷雞腿..","The meaning of the store name is unforgettable
Food plate is also good
It's a pity

Seafood pancakes are too thick and too wet!
Fish egg bibimbap tastes not obvious enough
Korean spicy pork is enough
Not greasy and no pig fishy ♥ ️

Then the taste of Anton stewed chicken
Very similar to the braised chicken legs of bento shop .."
"服務態度真的是有待進步。餐點部分口味一般，比較推薦的：
烘蛋，很大鍋，魚卵搭配下去口感層次豐富。
海鮮煎餅：口感外酥內Q的煎餅，在台北算好吃的。
小菜還有那種涼拌通心粉…？！ 很突兀。泡菜、蘿蔔是不錯。
炸雞普普。吃完一個人要750，蠻貴的。","The attitude of service is really yet to be improved.The taste of the meal is average, and it is more recommended:
Baked eggs, large pots, fish eggs are rich in taste.
Seafood pancakes: The pancakes with crispy and inside q are delicious in Taipei.
There is a kind of cold noodle powder ...?IntersectionVery abrupt.Kimchi and radish are good.
Fried chicken Pupu.It costs 750 after eating a person, which is quite expensive."
真的很驚艷的一家韓式料理，每樣都好好吃😋小菜也可以免費續，價錢也很公道。假日的內湖沒什麼人可以好好慢慢吃覺得很舒服 …,"The really amazing Korean cuisine can be renewed for free for each other, and the price is fair.No one can eat slowly on the holiday in Neihu and feel very comfortable to eat slowly ..."
"服務滿分，老闆娘十分親切。
有帶小朋友去還主動介紹哪些適合小孩吃！
服務人員有禮，雖然有部分是韓國人。
但簡單的中文加一點比手畫腳，可以溝通👌🏻

小菜六種，可以無限續。
不怕客人吃～還沒吃完也會主動問。

人參雞要先預訂。肉質真的很嫩。
湯頭因為有鍋吧飯一起熬煮很濃厚。

海鮮煎餅，好吃！
皮厚扎實香味夠！
我認為是今天第一名！

松阪豬肉質鮮嫩有嚼勁。
陶鍋烘蛋有起司跟一球魚卵，有點膩。。
炒冬粉好吃有入味。

醬肉鍋有點類似壽喜燒，口味普普。
但料多實在～

石鍋拌飯好吃，搭配的醬料不會太辣。很搭。
辣炒年糕加泡麵～有魚板
一開始不太辣，後勁有點辣～

生意很好當天是客滿的～
服務真的是很棒！

只是桌子有點搖晃，吃鍋有點擔心。。","The service is full, and the boss is very kind.
Take a child to take the initiative to introduce which suitable children to eat!
The service staff is polite, although some are Koreans.
But simple Chinese plus a little bit more hand -drawn, you can communicate 👌🏻

I'm not afraid of the guests to eat ~ I will take the initiative to ask.

Ginseng chicken must be reservations first.The meat is really tender.
The soup is very strong because of the pot.

總共1千出頭

泡菜煎餅不錯 味道有出來 (本身不是重口味哦！）
相對烘蛋及石鍋拌飯沒有什麼味道
部隊鍋普普通通

結論：和朋友聚餐聊天的好地方 這個份量三個女生吃有點多

給那麼多星星有個原因是店員服務很好😉","11/18 Dinner three girls eat
There are entertaining side dishes (small dishes can be continued infinitely)

There is a reason to give so many stars because the clerk service is very good."
"小菜精緻吃到飽，石鍋拌飯有很多的鍋巴，醬燒鍋湯頭濃郁， 辣炒年糕好吃。 服務非常優。

"烘蛋好吃，人多選套餐組合，只是套餐不能更換內容，部隊鍋還不錯料也很多，辣炒年糕不會太辣覺得好吃😋
三種肉拼盤，牛肉覺得筋太多了，不好咬，另外兩種肉類很好吃！

"便當拿泡菜當菜感覺誠意有點不足（韓國也不會把泡菜當配菜阿）

"因為IU而進店的，
雖然是平日，但仍然高朋滿座，
所以最好是事先預訂，
點兩人份套餐，份量非常多，
是可以3、4人使用的，
不論主餐或者是小菜都很好吃，
非常值得後續繼續來捧場。","I entered the store because of IU,
Although it is on weekdays, it is still full of friends,
So it's best to book in advance,
Order two sets of set meals with a lot of portions,
It can be used 3 or 4 people,
Both the main meals or side dishes are delicious,
It is worthy of continuing to continue the scene."
肉品類好像都是用氣炸鍋完成的口感，肉質乾又硬，感覺像在吃肉乾，服務還不錯，吃裝潢的一間店，音樂也不錯,The meat category seems to be the taste of using a gas frying pot. The meat is dry and hard. It feels like eating meat and good service. A shop with decoration and decoration is also good.
辣炒年糕還不錯，泡菜鍋的泡菜偏酸，我個人是很喜歡,The spicy fried rice cake is not bad.
餐點份量足，四人用餐點了三人套餐，剛好可以吃飽，雖然標榜韓式料理，但是也保有中式料理的美味，韓式檸檬紅茶口味特殊，可以嚐試，小菜可以續點，每樣味道都很到位。,"The meal is sufficient. The four meals ordered a three -person set meal. They can just eat them. Although they are advertised as Korean cuisine, they also retain the delicious Chinese cuisine. Korean lemon black tea has special flavor. The taste is in place."
海鮮煎餅好吃😋炸雞、鍋都覺得有點失望，不知道是不是因為去的時候店內冷氣壞掉？熱到食慾不振🤣,The seafood pancakes are delicious. The fried chicken and the pot feel a little disappointed. I wonder if it is because the air -conditioning in the shop is broken when I go?It's so hot to appetite 欲
環境整潔、店員很親切；餐點好吃，隨餐有六樣小菜，我們這次點雙人套餐，內容非常豐盛，價格也很便宜，適合家庭用餐。,"The environment is clean and the clerk is very kind; the meal is delicious, and there are six kinds of dishes with meals. This time we order a double package. The content is very rich and the price is very cheap. It is suitable for family meals."
"不好吃喔！菜色看起來都很漂亮，但真的不好吃，口味不是清淡而是整體調味有問題，完全和我口味不合

午間套餐韓式醬燒鍋（牛肉）湯頭完全沒味道，小菜泡菜不入味，既不酸、不蒜也不辣，魚板口感過軟沒味道，只有拌牛蒡帶點人篸味還不錯

朋友點的部隊鍋也是沒味道，儘管湯頭看起來紅通通但就是口味很不ok

魚板湯的魚板還沒熟透，吃起來還是硬硬的，湯頭也是非常平淡

海鮮煎餅除了最外層煎的脆脆之外，裡面都吃得到麵糊的味道沒有熟透的感覺，調味也是非常淡","Not delicious!The dishes look beautiful, but it is really not delicious. The taste is not light but the overall seasoning is problematic. It is completely inconsistent with my taste

The soup of the Korean sauce pot (beef) soup is completely flavorful, the pickled kimchi is not flavorful, neither sour, not garlic nor spicy, and the fish plate tastes soft and tasteless.

The troops ordered the troops of friends are also tasteless. Although the soup looks red, it is not OK

The fish plate of the fish plate soup is not familiar with it, it still tastes hard, and the soup is very bland.

In addition to the crispy and crunchy of the outermost layer of seafood pancakes, the flavor of the batter is not familiar, and the seasoning is also very light."
味道算不錯。但是他們的湯十分的大。兩個人絕對吃不完。烤肉，及泡菜豆腐那些都是可以去點的菜。小菜很好吃，而且是無限續加的。爬完金面山可以來吃這家😆 …,"The taste is good.But their soup is very big.Two people can't finish eating.Barbecue, kimchi tofu are all dishes that can be ordered.The side dishes are delicious, and it is continuously added.After climbing Golden Mountain, you can come to eat this 😆 ..."
週末晚上用餐需提前半天電話訂位，內場服務人員態度親切也很有效率，小菜豐富度可以很讓人驚豔，部隊鍋的肉類食材有點廉價，但整體用餐環境與體驗仍算是美好。,"On the weekend evening, you need to call for a half -day call for meals. The internal service staff attitude is kind and efficient. The richness of the side dishes can be amazing. The meat ingredients of the troops are a bit cheap, but the overall dining environment and experience are still beautiful."
口味都不錯，不過偏台式的味道，包含小菜在內。服務滿親切的、環境也舒適，會不停播放韓劇歌曲，邊吃邊猜是哪一齣韓劇，有趣！不過有穿插三生三世的歌曲😂 …,"The taste is good, but the taste of the partial table is included.The service is full of kind and the environment is comfortable. It will constantly play Korean drama songs.But there are songs that intersperse the third life 😂 ..."
"魚卵石鍋拌飯香氣足夠，搭配特製伴醬微辣好入口。小菜普通，泡菜比較沒有驚艷感。打卡送的棉花糖冰淇淋很可愛，哈密瓜口味的冰很濃郁。
（五顆星是因為很推薦大家來，小菜普通只是我個人口感不適合，並不代表這樣我就必須少給一顆星，每個人給星的標準本來就不一樣，也沒必要當下質疑對方的評論還跟同行有人說我的評論有問題。130的棉花糖冰淇淋並不是付不起，當下覺得我的評論讓店家不滿意事實上也可以直接收費冰淇淋而不是免費給予事後又結帳抱怨同行有人。）","The aroma of the bibimbap of fish pebibs is sufficient, and the special sauce is slightly spicy and good.The side dishes are ordinary, and kimchi is less amazing.The cotton sugar ice cream sent by punch card is very cute, and the cantaloupe flavor is rich in ice.

所以口味很道地
這次也有吃要提前預訂的人蔘雞湯
肉質很嫩 湯頭很鮮甜！
大概是吃了就回不去的那種程度！","It's great!The boss is Korean
So the taste is very authentic
This time, there are people who want to book in advance, chicken soup
The meat is very tender and the soup is very fresh!
Probably the level you can't go back when you eat it!"
起司蛋超好吃，部隊鍋就跟石鍋拌飯就一般口味，海鮮煎餅太多麵粉太厚個人不喜歡，空間不錯算是蠻好吃的，愉快的用餐體驗加到五顆星。,The cheese egg is super delicious. The troops are generally flavored with the stone pot bibimbap. The seafood pancakes are too much flour and too thick. Individuals do n’t like it. The space is pretty delicious. The pleasant dining experience is added to five stars.
"座位不會太擠，店內空間現代工業風，乾淨明亮，適合3個人以上聚餐，這次點2-3人套餐，3個小胃吃很撐，小菜可以一直點，主餐份量是一人份，都沒雷，小菜品質也不錯，我最愛是醬燒肉及魚卵拌飯，話說餐具好看也好使用，為何飲料用空白紙杯裝，整個店風格不一致，飲料換拿鐵加15元很划算，有星巴克的fu,1人均消475元","The seats will not be too crowded. The space in the store's modern industrial style is clean and bright. It is suitable for more than 3 people. This time, the 2-3 people set meals. 3 small stomachs can be eaten.

"用餐環境還不錯
小菜好吃可以續用

吃起來感受比較差

"小菜種類很豐富,個人喜歡雜菜冬粉跟洋蔥馬鈴薯蛋沙拉(可惜吃到好幾口蛋殼😅)。醬燒牛肉鍋料多實在。我們兩大兩小點三人餐,吃得超級飽。五星好評還有送甜棉花糖霜淇淋喔👍 …","The types of side dishes are very rich.

"區域內難得的韓式料理，挑高空間、大面窗的廚房，更顯環境的寬敞感；
餐前六盤小菜各有特色，豆皮扁絲軟鹹可口、醬醃小黃瓜鹹甜清爽、散蛋拌馬鈴薯泥、洋蔥絲口感豐富，海帶絲、大蕈菇及泡菜也都入味順口；
海鮮煎餅的餅脆，上層有蛋、有蝦等海鮮，柔軟可口，也沒過油的油耗味，多層風味一次入口，還有微甜、微辣的沾醬可口又能增加食慾，真是相得益彰。
燒烤五花肉，看似有肥肉，但完全無油膩的感覺，也無傳統燒烤的碳燒味，搭配生菜及味噌佐醬、蒜片，豐富口感、好生美味。
魚卵起司蛋捲，霹靂啪啦的魚卵伴隨蛋香、起司微鹹的多重風味，又創造出一疊色香味美食。
雖然價格合理，但要提醒的這裏有最低消費額350元。","The rare Korean cuisine in the area, the kitchen with high space and large -faced windows, shows the sense of spaciousness of the environment;
Before the meal, the side dishes have their own characteristics. The bean skin is soft and salty, salted and delicious, sauce pickled cucumber salty sweet and refreshing, loose eggs mixed potato puree, rich inion shreds, shredded shreds, mushrooms and kimchi.
The seafood pancakes are crispy, seafood such as eggs, shrimp and other seafood, soft and delicious, and no fuel consumption. The multi -layer flavor is imported at once, and the slightly sweet and spicy dipping sauce can increase appetite. Essence
Barbecue pork belly seems to have fatty meat, but it has no greasy feeling, and there is no traditional barbecue carbon -roasted flavor. It is accompanied by lettuce and miso sauce, garlic slices, which is rich in taste and delicious.
Fish egg cheese egg rolls, Perak's poppy eggs accompanied by egg aroma and cheese slightly salty flavor, and created a stack of colored and fragrant food.
Although the price is reasonable, it is reminded that there is a minimum consumption of 350 yuan."
點了午間套餐，鍋跟小菜口味都普通，牛腱有部分很難咬。,"After ordering the lunch set, the flavor of the pot and the side dishes is ordinary, and some of the beef tendons are difficult to bite."
"打卡蜂巢馬格利就半價！

兩人套餐的份量非常足夠
店家還會送多種不同的小菜
可以吃得非常飽～～～～","Pickup the honeycomb Magley is half price!

The amount of the two set meals is very sufficient
The store will also give a variety of different side dishes
You can eat very full ~~~~"
第一次來這裡用餐，有商業午餐，店內裝潢乾淨簡單，服務人員反應很快也親切，這次聚餐我們點了人參雞湯、雪濃湯、海鮮煎餅、部隊鍋、醬燒牛肉鍋～由於人參雞限量，也馬上幫我們預留，幸運點到最後一鍋人參雞湯，雞肉燉的很軟嫩，筷子夾一下就下來了，海鮮煎餅酥酥脆脆，搭配沾醬很清爽，雪濃湯裡有附一點麵線，還有搭配一碗白飯及小菜，一個人可以吃很飽，醬燒牛肉鍋，肉的份量也很多，裡面也有冬粉，整鍋撈不完，很推薦大家可以來用餐🍴 …,"The first time I came here for dinner, there was a commercial lunch, the interior of the store was clean and simple, and the service staff responded quickly and kindly. This time we ordered ginseng chicken soup, snow soup, seafood pancakes, troops pots, sauce beef pots ~ due to ginseng due to ginseng ~ The chicken is limited, and it is also reserved immediately. Lucky to the last pot of ginseng chicken soup. The chicken stew is very soft and tender. Attach a little noodle, as well as a bowl of rice and side dishes. One person can eat very full, roast beef pot, and the amount of meat is also large. There are winter powder in it. Mowing"
"訂位時，服務人員告知用餐時間是90分鐘，到現場卻說用餐ㄧ小時，而且只賣商業午餐，說明是特地從很遠的地方來用餐，才說那你們就吃90分鐘，也絲毫沒有道歉！真是可惜了！
後續吃海鮮煎餅還吃到類似貝類的貝殼，割傷了嘴巴，店家就把海鮮煎餅錢及服務費扣掉，也說明如果之後有產生醫療費用，會願意負擔，副店長臨場反應，處理的不錯。
只可惜之前訂位及帶位人員的專業度及服務都不夠。
至於餐點就一般韓國菜口味，沒有什麼特別表現！","At the time of ordering, the service staff told the meals for 90 minutes. When I arrived at the scene, I said that the meal was hour, and only a commercial lunch was sold, indicating that it was specially ate from far away. IntersectionIt's a pity!
After eating seafood pancakes, she also eaten shells similar to shells, cutting their mouths, and the store deducted seafood pancake money and service fees. It also shows that if there is medical expenses incurred in the future, they will be willing to afford it. Not bad.
Unfortunately, the professionalism and services of the reservations and personnel were not enough.
As for the meal, it is generally the taste of Korean dishes, and there is nothing special!"
"平日午餐定食一律229+10%服務費
·海鮮豆腐鍋：湯頭美味好喝，裡面有兩隻蝦子、蛤蜊、魷魚、半熟蛋、豆腐，搭配三樣小菜及一碗白飯","Normally 229+10%service fee for lunch for lunch
· Seafood tofu pot: soup is delicious and delicious, there are two shrimp, clams, squid, semi -cooked eggs, tofu, with three small dishes and a bowl of rice"
"小菜好吃又免費，很加分！
煎餅不夠酥，蒸蛋味道很一般，這兩道比較可惜！","The side dishes are delicious and free, very bonus!
The pancakes are not crispy enough, and the steamed egg tastes very average. These two are unfortunate!"
"五花肉泡菜鍋：泡菜有點酸，五花肉尚可，湯頭尚可
韓式醬燒肉：燒肉跟洋蔥一樣多，小菜普通
炒年糕：年糕QQ的，微辣😋 …","Pork belly kimchi pot: kimchi is a bit sour, pork belly is acceptable, and the soup head is acceptable
Korean sauce roasted meat: roasted meat is as many as onions, small dishes are ordinary
Rice cake: rice cake QQ, slightly spicy 😋 ..."
"整理還不錯，服務人員很棒
餐點好吃，很適合家庭聚餐","The finishing is not bad, the service staff is great
The meal is delicious, it is very suitable for family dinner"
"食物是無辜的，純粹只是因為服務態度，來我們桌跟我們買單有刺青包手的男服務生，只耽誤你一分鐘的時間來決定要付現還是刷卡，給我回一句是好了沒？ 還卡跟收據也是很隨便，雖然說我們跟服務生也沒什麼交集，但基本的禮貌也還是要有的吧。
還有也是那個男服務生真的不要剛抽完菸再來送餐，菸味太重了。
整體服務差強人意。光是服務可能評價就被扣光了","The food is innocent. It is purely because of the service attitude. When we come to our table, we buy a male waiter with tattoos with tattoos. It only delays you for one minute to decide to pay or swipe the card. Is it okay to give me a sentence?It is also very casual card and the receipt. Although we have no intersection with the waiter, the basic politeness still needs to be available.
There is also the male waiter who really don't want to get the meal after smoking, the smell of smoke is too heavy.
The overall service is poor.The service alone may be deducted by the evaluation"
小菜種類多可以一直續，吃得晚餐三個主餐都很棒，我是帶著寶寶去的，老闆貼心送上蒸蛋一下子小孩把飯吃完了。還有娃娃椅，帶小朋友去的可以參考喔。,"There are many types of side dishes that can be continued. The three main meals for dinner are great. I took the baby with the baby.There is also a doll chair, you can refer to it with children."
整體服務是好的，可惜味道不夠地道，特別是人參雞與部隊鍋都不在味覺範圍，海鮮煎餅與辣炒年糕是對味的，出餐速度不錯。,"The overall service is good. Unfortunately, the taste is not authentic, especially the ginseng chicken and the troops are not in the range of taste. Seafood pancakes and spicy fried rice cakes are right and the meals are good."
「輪流請客」位在西湖站附近，走路約5分鐘，內部挑高的裝潢，時尚舒適的設計與位置，給人愉快的用餐體驗。食物道地不油膩，CP值相當高，比起食材本身，價位並不算高。服務員態度親切，鍋類會親自來桌邊協助調理。特別值得一提的是，小菜類共有20多種，不定期更換，因此每次來都會吃到不一樣的小菜，有種驚喜包的感覺。,"""Take turns"" is located near Xihu Station, walking for about 5 minutes, high interior decoration, stylish and comfortable design and location, giving people a pleasant dining experience.The food is not greasy, and the CP value is quite high. Compared with the ingredients itself, the price is not high.The waiter has a kind attitude, and the pot will personally come to the table to assist in conditioning.It is particularly worth mentioning that there are more than 20 kinds of small dishes and they are replaced from time to time. Therefore, every time you come, you will eat different side dishes, and you feel like a surprise bag."
"無論是主餐或小菜味道都不錯吃～
加辣醬很道地，少了辣就少一味，
湯不知道是否有鹹鴨蛋，怎麼喝到鹹蛋黃味XD
算是很正常發揮的韓式料理餐廳！","Whether it is the main meal or side dish, it tastes good ~
It is very authentic to add spicy sauce.
I don’t know if there is a salted duck egg, how to drink salted egg yolk flavor XD
It is a Korean cuisine restaurant that is very normal!"
"環境氣氛好,小菜很多可以續,喜歡石鍋拌飯,唯一美中不足的是豬五花有點肥,吃起來有點害怕😨 …","The environmental atmosphere is good, many side dishes can be continued. I like stone pot bibimbap. The only thing that is beautiful is that the pork flowers are a bit fat, and it is a bit scared to taste ..."
開始上菜後速度就開始三倍的快轉，桌子一下就被塞滿了。從小菜一路吃到正餐好過癮。小菜的蛋沙拉好好吃，配上清爽的小黃瓜很適合炎炎夏日。超有療癒感的韓國料理。,"After starting the food, the speed starts to turn three times, and the table is filled with it.It ’s enjoyable to eat the main meals all the way.The egg salad of the side dishes is delicious, and the refreshing cucumber is suitable for hot summer.Super healing Korean cuisine."
"老闆還滿帥的也會講韓文
內裝很好看光線很美
不過只有看起來而已
四人座的桌子油到我必須另外拿衛生紙擦
飲料只有水沒有別的
菜單濕濕油油的有點噁
餐點大概都在400-600左右
還要收一成服務費
點了一個1280的兩-三人套餐
小菜無限續還不錯
而且也滿好吃的
烤鯖魚是今天最好吃的菜了
不過刺有點多
之後的厚烤豬肉不錯吃不過有點焦味
口感也沒有那麼順
石鍋拌飯也不錯吃
鍋巴很棒不會太濕或太乾
烘蛋捲本身味道太淡
另一個石鍋拌飯是牛肉配上明太子
也是不錯吃
整體來說味道不錯
但份量對三人來說稍嫌小
加服務費每個人是470左右
不太值得
不過畢竟是內科
要在內科生存的店也頗不容易
希望這些小細節可以改進
用餐體驗會比較完整
不然感覺有點外強中乾
旁邊的春水堂都還比較便宜
又比較好吃的感覺","The boss is also handsome and will speak Korean
The interior is beautiful and the light is beautiful
But only it looks like
The table oil of the four people is so that I must wipe it with another toilet paper
There is only water in drinks
The menu is a bit evil
The meal is about 400-600
Also charge a service fee
Ordered a 1280-three-three-person package
The side dishes are infinitely good and pretty good
And also delicious
Baked catfish is the best dish today
But a little thorns
After the thick roasted pork is good, it is a bit burnt
The taste is not so smooth
Stone pot bibimbap is also good to eat
The pot is great or dry or too dry
The roasted egg roll itself is too light
Another stone pot bibimbap is beef with Prince Ming
It's also good to eat
Overall it tastes good
But the number is a little bit small for the three
The service fee is around 470
Not worth it
But after all, it is internal medicine
It is not easy to survive in the Department of Internal Medicine
I hope these small details can be improved
The dining experience will be relatively complete
Otherwise, it feels a bit strong and dry
The Chunshui Hall next to it is still cheaper
It feels more delicious"
"好吃才會二訪，菜色都還不錯，口味算重的，可以續的小菜味道也很夠味
點分享餐就很飽，舉例2人分享餐3人剛剛好😁 …","It ’s good to visit the second visit. The dishes are pretty good. The taste is heavy.

小菜可以一直續，店面挑高也很舒服
可惜海鮮煎餅有點油，不然整體份量超級足，吃的好飽很好吃！！！","Delicious Korean cuisine
The side dishes can be continued, and the store is very comfortable to pick up high

"份量不多,但小菜可以吃到飽,泡菜個人覺得太酸不喜歡吃太酸的不建議嘗試.","There are not much portion, but the side dishes can be full. Person kimchi personally thinks that it is too sour to eat too sour. It is not recommended to try it."
"今天是新人迎新，店內裝潢工業風，座位沒有太寬敞，整體環境還算舒適，中午上菜速度很快。

今天點了商午，辣牛肉鍋和辣炒年糕，中規中矩的口感和味道，辣牛肉辣度我覺得剛好，有辣但又不會超過，天氣冷來一份很舒服，肉不少，小菜也可以一直續，算是滿有CP值。下次再來試試晚上其他餐點😁😁😁","Today is the newcomer welcoming the new. The interior of the store is decorated with industrial style. The seats are not too spacious. The overall environment is still comfortable. It is fast at noon.

"第一次評價餐廳，因為值得推薦～
我們點了很多吃光光後才想起拍照，
味道地道蔘雞湯有鍋巴很特別，味道也很濃～
下次會來吃其他的","The first evaluation of the restaurant, because it is worth recommending ~
We ordered a lot after eating a lot of time.
Taste, authentic chicken soup is very special, and the taste is very strong ~
I will come to eat others next time"
"名過其實，嚼不斷的筋和外酥內泥的煎餅加上很一般的炸雞～
只能說期望太高、CP值得評比下價格不算低。
服務態度有好的有差的，不想打翻辛苦的人。","Over the name, the chewing muscles and pancakes with inside mud outside plus a very ordinary fried chicken ~
It can only be said that the expectations are too high, and the price is not low under the evaluation.
The service attitude is good and poor, and people who do not want to overturn hard."
"很好吃份量多
但是泡菜湯偏鹹
跟印象中泡菜湯應該偏酸不太一樣
建議可以自行加點水
小菜吃完都可續加","Very delicious
But kimchi soup is salty
It should be sour as the kimchi soup in the impression
It is recommended to add some water by yourself
You can add it to the side dish after eating"
"韓式小菜可以續
辣炒年糕很夠味但是份量有點少
秘製醬汁的炸雞也不錯
可以再回訪吃吃別種菜色！","Korean small dishes can be continued
Spicy fried rice cake is delicious, but the portion is a bit small
The frying chicken with a secret sauce is also good
You can go back to eat and eat other dishes!"
小菜具韓國特色 壞境優美 白飯好吃 價格算合理 豆腐鍋湯頭好喝、年糕夠辣軟Q適中好吃 忘了拍照 下次再來補上,"Small vegetable utensils, Korean characteristic bad, beautiful rice, delicious rice is delicious, the price is reasonable, tofu pot soup is delicious, rice cake is spicy enough, spicy, soft, and delicious."
"1.用餐氣氛：進門感覺來到首爾的餐廳，有出國的感覺。
2.餐點菜色：初次來用餐，點了雙人套餐，滿滿的菜色，吃得很愉快。
3.服務態度：人員態度親切，上菜速度很快。
4.設備功能：音響效果適中不會太吵，冷氣可以再強一點。","1. Dining atmosphere: I feel like I came to the restaurant in Seoul in the door, and it feels like going abroad.
2. Meals and dishes: For the first time, I ordered a double set meal.
3. Service attitude: staff attitude is cordial, and the food is fast.
4. Equipment function: The sound effect is not too noisy, and the air -conditioning can be stronger."
完完全全踩到雷，部隊湯味道很不對沒有韓式辣口味的感覺，然後點了肉（拼盤）松阪豬有腥味，一口都沒咬，牛小排勉強下肚，五花肉根本都是肥肉，完全無法吃下去，第一次吃到這麼讓人傻眼的東西，重點是價格不便宜但沒有做出這種水準的餐點賣給消費者，確定有要好好經營？最後 既然妳們也收了服務費，是不是連基本的謝謝光臨至少要說一下？？我不太懂是不會講中文還是妳不想講，最基本的東西先做好再準備賣給客人吧！不管是你的餐點還是服務，當然是絕對不可能再去了。,"Stepping on the thunder completely, the troops soup taste is not the same as the Korean spicy taste, and then ordered the meat (platter) Matsusaka pig with fishy smell, no bite in one bite. Meat, I ca n’t eat it at all. For the first time, I ate such a dumbfounded thing. The point is that the price is not cheap but did not make such a standard meal to consumers. Do you want to operate well?In the end, since you also charge the service fee, do you even have the basic thank you to come and have to talk about it?IntersectionI do n’t know if I do n’t speak Chinese or you do n’t want to speak. The most basic things are done first before preparing to sell it to guests!Whether it is your meal or service, of course, it is absolutely impossible to go again."
小菜水平不錯而且可以免費續加，醬燒牛香氣十足好吃，石鍋拌飯料好實在鍋巴很香，海鮮煎餅粉漿部分偏軟。,The level of the side dishes is good and can be added for free. The sauce is full of aroma and delicious aroma. The stone pot bibimbap is really fragrant.
點雙人套餐，選了魚卵拌飯、爆炸蛋、醬燒豬肉鍋，附上六道小菜與兩杯飲料，東西都好吃，但覺得價格偏貴一點，一人吃下來要五百多元。生意很好，沒有訂位可能需要排隊，用餐時間有90分鐘限制。,"Ordered a double set meal, chose fish egg bibimbap, explosive eggs, and roasted pork pot. It attached six small dishes and two cups of drinks. The things are delicious, but the price is more expensive. One person is more than 500 yuan.The business is very good, and there may be a queue without reservation. The meal time is limited by 90 minutes."
平日中午用餐，餐點的品項很少不知道平日是不是只有簡餐的選項，如果是這樣建議還是註明清楚，餐點很普通中午簡餐適合附近的上班族，如果想從很遠的地方特別過來吃建議是不需要了。,"At lunch at lunch, the items of the meal are rarely known. I do n’t know if there is only a simple meal option on weekdays. If so it is recommended, it is clear that the meal is very common for the nearby office workers. It is not necessary to come here to eat specially."
"餐點好吃，辣度剛剛好！
雖然中秋假期很忙碌，但服務員都很耐心的服務","The meal is delicious, the spicyness is just right!
Although the Mid -Autumn Festival holiday is busy, the waiters are very patient service"
"我是點雙人分享餐990+10%
韓式醬燒肉鍋+魚卵拌飯+爆炸陶鍋蛋+雙人飲料(奶茶+紅茶)
覺得這個價格還能接受，因為還有附六盤小菜，無限續加。
韓式醬燒肉鍋的肉超多，而且裡面還有菇類蔬菜跟冬粉，湯雖然有點偏鹹但是還不錯喝。
魚卵拌飯沒有到非常驚豔，但是算是有味道而且能吃飽。
爆炸陶鍋蛋就很普通，就是烘蛋這樣。
小菜沒有因為式小菜就隨便做，味道都非常的入味。
整體下來兩個女生沒有吃完，韓式醬燒肉鍋還剩一堆，只是都把肉吃掉而已，而且服務生態度也很好，所以給五星!","I am a dual -sharing meal 990+10%
Korean sauce roasted meat pot+fish egg bibimbap+explosive pottery pot egg+double drink (milk tea+black tea)
I think this price can still be acceptable, because there are six plates of side dishes, which are infinitely added.
There are many meats in Korean sauce roasted meat pots, and there are mushrooms and winter powder. Although the soup is a bit salty, it is pretty good.
Fish egg bibimbap is not very stunning, but it tastes taste and can be full.
Explosive pottery eggs are very ordinary, that is, it is a roasted egg.
Small dishes do not make it because of the type of side dishes, and the taste is very delicious.
On the whole, the two girls did not finish eating, there were still a bunch of Korean sauce roasted meat pots, but they were eaten by the meat, and the service ethics was also very good, so give five stars!"
餐點味道中等，餐廳環境氣氛不錯，店員客氣會協助桌邊料理，棉花糖甜點蠻特別的，價格每人約$350左右,"The meal has a medium taste, and the restaurant's environment atmosphere is good. The clerk will help the table dishes. The marshmallow dessert is quite special. The price is about $ 350 per person."
乳酪牛肉餅兩個小小的250，吃起來像超商肉包的內餡，沒什麼乳酪味。燒肉鍋很鹹，吃起來像日式壽喜燒，不愛壽喜燒的人千萬不要點，覺得兩樣都很雷。燒肉鍋份量很大，兩個人多到吃不完，店員說會吃不飽又加點了泡麵，建議真的吃不飽再點。冷氣一直滴水，還滴到鍋內湯噴出來。一下廚房要關了，一下要結帳叫人先付錢，一下要打烊了要先清廁所，不想一直被打擾的人也不適合來。一顆星給小菜還不錯。,"Two small 250s of cheese beef cakes, it tastes like the filling of the super commercial meat bag, there is no cheese flavor.The roasted meat pot is very salty. It tastes like a Japanese -style life -long burn. People who do n’t like to burn in their life do n’t have to order.The roast pot is very large, and the two people can't finish eating. The clerk said that he would eat enough and add a little instant noodles. It is recommended that you really can't eat it.The air -conditioned dripping water and dripping into the pot of the pot.The kitchen is closed. You have to pay people to pay for the checkout first. If you want to close it, you have to clear the toilet first. People who do n’t want to be disturbed are not suitable.A star is pretty good to give side dishes."
用餐環境乾淨明亮，今天點了2人分享餐，份量還滿多的，兩個人吃不完。韓式燒肉鍋口味有點像清淡一點的壽喜燒，小菜可口且可以續加，服務也還不錯。,"The dining environment is clean and bright. Today, two people shared the meals. The amount was full, and the two could not finish eating.The taste of Korean roasted meat pot is a bit like a lighter Shouhizi, the side dishes can be delicious and can be renewed, and the service is not bad."
餐廳環境明亮整齊，服務很積極，食物口味稍微普通了些。,"The restaurant environment is bright and neat, the service is very positive, and the taste of food is slightly more common."
跟服務生反應牛小排跟豬肉全是肥肉又咬不斷很硬，淡漠的回我說我在跟廚房說，吃個飯廚房有夠吵好像下班一樣，部隊鍋料也很少但不難吃，唉太可怕了,"Reaction to the waiter reacts with the pork and the pork is full of fat and the bites are constantly hard. I said indifferently that I was saying to the kitchen that eating a rice kitchen is enough to make a noise like going to work. Eat, it's terrible"
很道地的韓式料理 ，但卻多了一份精緻感與享受，每道菜色都很值得一吃，推 推 推!!,"Very authentic Korean cuisine, but there is a sense of exquisiteness and enjoyment. Each dish is worth eating, push !!"
"好吃！
韓式醬燒肉鍋和海鮮煎餅大推。","tasty!
Korean sauce roasted meat pot and seafood pancake push."
小菜相當地道！韓味滿滿 不錯吃。唯獨座位稍嫌擁擠。,The side dishes are quite authentic!Han Wei is full of good food.The seat is slightly crowded.
雖然在科技園區假日用餐依舊滿位，小菜可無限續，份量足味道佳，CP值不錯的餐廳。,"Although dining in the science and technology park is still full, the side dishes can be continued infinitely, and the taste is good and the CP value is good."
"晚上來享用果然跟只有一小時休息的午餐比起來愜意多了, 這次點了雙人餐再加一份辣炒年糕，整體餐點的口味算是夠味，但小菜類的秀珍菇跟洋蔥馬鈴薯蛋（？）這兩款相較之下，是走健康路線，雖然清淡可還是能吃到原味，還不錯。

部隊鍋味道不錯，餡料偏多加工肉（我知道實際是的部隊鍋的由來），泡麵也好吃

陶鍋蛋一上菜就很香，口味也與香味相符，好吃

辣炒年糕比部隊鍋內的年糕還要Q彈，有辣味，但不會辣到吃不了。

魚卵拌飯，看來清淡，拌開後，入口香味就顯現了，加上鍋巴，整個加分。

小菜都可再續，但雙人餐已經滿到喉頭了，只能吃完桌面小菜，其餘打包帶走XD","Come and enjoy at night. It really is much more comfortable than lunch with only one hour of rest. This time, I ordered a double meal plus a spicy fried rice cake. ?) These two) In comparison, they are taking a healthy route. Although they can still eat the original flavor, it is not bad.

The troops have a good taste, and the filling of the meat is too much (I know the origin of the troops in the troops), and the instant noodles are delicious.

The pottery pot is very fragrant as soon as it is served, and the taste is in line with the fragrance. It is delicious

The spicy fried rice cakes have Q bombs than the rice cakes in the troops. They have spicy flavor, but they will not be spicy enough.

Fish egg bibimbap seems to be light. After mixing, the fragrance of the mouth appears, plus the pot, the entire points.

The side dishes can be continued, but the two -person meals have been full of their throats. They can only eat desktop side dishes."
"服務員態度良好
但食物沒味道
很不韓式","The waiter has a good attitude
But the food is tasteless
Very unsatisfactory"
食物普通，座位安排的很緊密，即便是商業午餐結帳金額也會超過250，不過整體用餐感覺還不錯。,"The food is ordinary, and the seats are tightly arranged. Even the amount of commercial lunch will exceed 250, but the overall meal feels good."
小菜主餐都好吃  生意很好 額外會收一成小費,The main dishes are delicious and the business is very good.
"海鮮煎餅(300元) 背面一大片焦黑。

店員告知每人低消350元小菜才能續。

以這樣的的品質與價位我不如去吃百貨公司的美食街。","Seafood pancakes (300 yuan) are a large scorched back on the back.

70 % of beef pot (250 yuan) is fat.

The clerk informed that each person was 350 yuan of small dishes to continue.

吃到許多不常見的韓國料理，重點東西真的非常好吃，值得一訪,"After eating a lot of uncommon Korean cuisine, the key things are really delicious, it is worth visiting"
這家韓國餐廳是內湖科技園區週邊值得推薦的餐廳之一。他們提供無限配菜的傳統韓國菜餚。他們還提供獨特的飲料和一些韓國融合食品。他們可能有英文菜單，但他們的菜單上有照片。他們接受本地和外國信用卡。,"This Korean restaurant is one of the recommended restaurants around the Neihu Science and Technology Park.They provide traditional Korean dishes with infinite side dishes.They also provide unique drinks and some Korean fusion foods.They may have an English menu, but their menus have photos.They accept local and foreign credit cards."
"有時下班後或午餐時來到這裡，總的來說，一切都很好，但對我來說有點當地風味，因為我可以區分當地和傳統的韓國食物。另外，喜歡配菜。
總是點同樣的食物，這是我在這個地方最喜歡的。推薦嘗試一下。","Sometimes I come here after get off work or at lunch. Generally speaking, everything is good, but it is a bit local, because I can distinguish local and traditional Korean food.In addition, like side dishes.
Always order the same food, this is what I like most in this place.Recommended try."
提供韓國料理、特色火鍋的組合。  食材新鮮，口味偏甜。  不過，豬肉片有點乾，對於這道菜來說脂肪含量不夠。  服務很好！,"Provide a combination of Korean cuisine and special hot pot.The ingredients are fresh and the taste is sweet.However, pork slices are a bit dry, and the fat content is not enough for this dish.The service was excellent!"
"點了部隊鍋，問了老闆娘才知道原來是熬了一天的骨頭湯當底，才會有這麼濃鬱的湯頭。
海鮮煎餅外酥內軟，很符合台灣人的口味耶！
參雞湯記得要先預訂才有！","After ordering the troops, I asked the boss that I knew that the bone soup that had been boiled for a day would be the bottom, and there would be such a strong soup.
Seafood pancakes are crispy and soft inside, which is in line with the taste of Taiwanese!
Remember to book the chicken soup before you have!"
都很平均都很一般般，但是物有所值,"They are all average and ordinary, but it is worthwhile"
"推薦給喜歡韓國料理的人。我們得到了很有價值的一餐，而且價格合理。如果您正在尋找韓國餐廳與朋友聚會，應該很適合。
從西湖捷運站步行（5分鐘）也很方便。","Recommended to those who like Korean cuisine.We got a very valuable meal, and the price was reasonable.If you are looking for a Korean restaurant to meet with friends, it should be very suitable.
It is also convenient to walk from the West Lake MRT station (5 minutes)."
吃了這兩個，泡菜湯和牛肉一個。如果你喜歡濃烈的味道，我可以推薦泡菜湯。非常適合寒冷的天氣。但如果你喜歡清淡的湯，牛肉會是不錯的選擇🙌🏻,"Eat these two, kimchi soup and beef.If you like a strong taste, I can recommend kimchi soup.Very suitable for cold weather.But if you like light soup, beef will be a good choice 🙌🏻"
該地區一家不錯的韓國餐廳。我們在周中去吃辦公室午餐。預訂後，我們還需要等待大約20分鐘才能找到座位。食物很美味而且準時送達（我們也提前點了）。然而，我想說的是，相對於你收到的品質和份量來說，它的價格有點高。但如果你在內湖尋找韓國美食，我還是會推薦它。,"A good Korean restaurant in the area.We go to the office lunch in the middle of the week.After booking, we need to wait about 20 minutes to find a seat.The food is delicious and delivered on time (we also order it in advance).However, what I want to say is that it is a bit high compared to the quality and amount you received.But if you look for Korean food in Neihu, I will still recommend it."
"太好吃啦⋯⋯
今天點的是部隊鍋跟魚卵烘蛋捲
蛋捲烘的剛剛好，軟嫩適中，滿滿的起司跟魚卵👍❤️
附贈的小菜，泡菜，蘿蔔，甜不辣，通心粉，真心道地好吃，還一直續，大推！
下次還要來😄","It's so delicious ...

The egg rolls are just right, the soft and tender, full of cheese and fish eggs 👍❤️
The attached side dishes, kimchi, radishes, sweet and not spicy, nice powder, delicious and delicious, but also continue, push!
I will come next time 来"
無論是性價比還是味道都不錯。特別是有一位韓國工作人員，所以我被舒適地引導，並吃了一頓美味的飯菜。我推薦給附近的韓國人。,"Whether it is cost -effective or tasteful.Especially a Korean staff, so I was comfortable and ate a delicious meal.I recommend it to nearby Koreans."
周圍很少有韓國餐館，商務午餐只在工作日提供。不想等的話需要預約！,"There are few Korean restaurants around, and business lunches are only available on working days.If you don't want to wait, you need to make an appointment!"
食物很美味，空間也很吸引人！我強烈推薦這個地方的韓國菜。 👍👍👍👍👍 …,The food is delicious and the space is very attractive!I strongly recommend Korean cuisine in this place.👍👍👍👍👍 👍👍👍👍👍 ...
內湖區美味道地的韓國料理！內裝很漂亮，強烈推薦！,South Korean cuisine in Neihu District!The interior is very beautiful and highly recommended!
食物很好，有很多韓國菜可供選擇。我們真的很喜歡！,"The food is very good, and there are many Korean dishes to choose from.We really like it!"
美味的食物和舒適的氛圍，非常適合家人或朋友聚會。位置距離西湖站僅5分鐘路程。一定會再光臨！,The delicious food and comfortable atmosphere are very suitable for family or friends.The location is only 5 minutes away from West Lake Station.Will come again!
美味正宗的韓國料理。就像我在首爾吃的一樣。服務也很好。室內設計非常現代且舒適。整個地方寬敞明亮，用餐體驗非常好。離地鐵站不遠，所以去哪裡都很方便。,"Delicious authentic Korean cuisine.Just like what I eat in Seoul.The service is also very good.The interior design is very modern and comfortable.The whole place is spacious and bright, and the dining experience is very good.Not far from the subway station, so it is convenient to go everywhere."

"3.5顆星

本次中午消費商業套餐，點了韓式拌飯與泡菜鍋，其他商品也蠻多的（總共大概七、八種）。

韓式拌飯的味道還可以，以中餐來說整體的份量也算足。

泡菜鍋整體的味道不錯，湯頭很濃鬱夠味，味道吃起來蠻道地的，但是泡菜鍋的料稍少。

商業午餐都附三樣小菜（本次有泡菜、豆芽與半顆韓式滷蛋），小菜可以續加這點值得鼓勵，這樣才是道地韓國料理。

整體的裝潢不錯，燈飾很新潮，環境整潔乾淨，採光明亮，靠牆的座位區的連體座椅比較不舒服，另外餐具是亮點，大概是我吃過的韓式餐廳裡餐具最佳的。

價格以一般午餐來說可能稍高，商業套餐一份NT$229需額外加服務費，加NT$50可以以套餐加價方式加點用星巴克咖啡豆沖的咖啡。若是商務聚餐是可以考慮用餐的地方。

小路評價：7/12","3.5 stars

At noon, the consumer business package, ordered Korean bibimbap and kimchi pot, there are quite a lot of other products (about seven or eight).

The taste of Korean bibimbap is okay. In terms of Chinese food, the overall weight is sufficient.

The whole kimchi pot tastes good as a whole, the soup is very rich and enough, and the taste tastes very good, but the kimchi pot is slightly less ingredient.

There are three kinds of small dishes (this time there are kimchi, bean sprouts, and half Korean marinated eggs). The side dishes can be added to be encouraged, so that it is Korean food.

The overall decoration is good, the lighting is very trendy, the environment is clean and clean, and the lighting is bright. The conjoined seats in the seat area of ​​the wall are relatively uncomfortable. In addition, the tableware is the highlight, probably the best tableware in the Korean restaurant I have ever eaten.

The price may be slightly higher in general lunch. A commercial package requires an additional service fee for NT $ 229. Plus NT $ 50 can add coffee with starbucks coffee beans with a price increase.If you are a business dinner, you can consider dining.

Xiaolu evaluation: 7/12"
"時隔許久才嚐到家鄉牛肉烤肉的味道！
配菜很豐富，所以我吃得很好。","It took a long time to taste the taste of beef barbecue in my hometown!
The side dishes are rich, so I eat well."
好吃😋,Delicious
我最近吃過的最好的韓國菜之一。拌飯的份量十足，味道也很好，韓國燒烤的口感也很完美。雖然我沒有得到任何免費的甜點，但我肯定很想再來這裡。順便說一句，我認為服務沒有以前評論的那麼糟糕，如果他們能及時檢查客戶的需求，服務仍然可以改進。,"One of the best Korean foods I have recently eaten.The bibimbap has a full weight and good taste. The taste of Korean barbecue is also perfect.Although I did not get any free desserts, I definitely wanted to come here again.By the way, I think the service is not as bad as the previous comments. If they can check the needs of customers in time, the service can still be improved."
"我去過很多韓國餐館，這是最美味的一餐！韓國工作人員讓訂購變得很容易，而且非常友好！
店裡的氣氛也不錯，打算下次再去！","I have been to many Korean restaurants, this is the most delicious meal!South Korean staff make ordering easy and very friendly!
The atmosphere in the store is also good, I plan to go next time!"
分享餐 菜色多 份量足,Share the meals with multiple parts

關於韓韓的味道","Both side dishes and food are delicious.It's really Korean!
If you want to eat Korean cuisine, you must come here!Intersection

The taste of Han and South Korea"
我們12點到達並向女服務員提供訂單，她正忙著安排其他客人並在12:17點餐。我們在12:36點餐，其他晚到的客人比我們更早點餐。浪費時間。如果你沒有足夠的時間吃午餐或你餓了，我不推薦這家餐廳。,"We arrived at 12 o'clock and provided an order to the female waiter. She was busy arranging other guests and meals at 12:17.We meals at 12:36, and other late guests have a better meal than us.Waste time.If you don't have enough time to eat lunch or you are hungry, I don't recommend this restaurant."
不錯！但配菜只有3種。,good!But there are only 3 kinds of side dishes.
"這是擺盤整齊的韓國料理。
剛開始，武大雞飯的味道很台灣。
最近，它已成為韓國風味。哈哈，變得好吃了。
其他...其他選單項目也很美味。","This is a neat Korean cuisine.

I often go to Taiwan to travel.
There are not many good Korean restaurants.
I completed it roughly, but I finally found it.

"一個人不再想去不接受食物的地方吃飯，基本心態差，沒有服務概念，
一個只透露金錢的地方，似乎對食物的成分也有大概的了解。","A person no longer wants to eat without accepting food. The basic mentality is poor and there is no concept of service.
A place that only reveals money seems to have a general understanding of the ingredients of food."
最好的韓國餐廳不在韓國。熱點地區的口味有一定的規模，韓國烤肉的質感也很完美。甚至還有免費的甜點,"The best Korean restaurant is not in South Korea.The taste of hot areas has a certain scale, and the texture of Korean barbecue is also perfect.There are even free desserts"
