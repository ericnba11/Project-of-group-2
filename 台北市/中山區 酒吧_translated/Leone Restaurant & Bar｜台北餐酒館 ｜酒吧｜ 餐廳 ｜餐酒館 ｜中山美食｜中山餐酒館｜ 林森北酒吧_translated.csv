"服務上很周到，點餐前先給一杯高湯暖胃，高湯很好喝！吃完的餐盤很快就會被收走，服務員都有在觀察大家的用餐狀況，廁所很大間，也有提供漱口水。
餐點的部分，藍鑽蟹肉餅味增海膽醬，蟹肉與鮭魚卵配合醬料，真的很喜歡！
神秘菜單-碳烤依比利豬與義式醃製泡菜，這道我也喜歡！
剝皮辣椒雞燉飯-台式與義式的結合，竟無違和感！這種洋氣的台式料理，大成功！
值得再訪的餐廳！","The service is very thoughtful. Before ordering, give a cup of broth to warm the stomach, and the broth is delicious!After eating the plate, they will be taken away soon. The waiters are observing everyone's dining status. The toilet is very large, and mouthwash is also provided.
For the meal, the blue diamond crab cake flavor the sea urchin sauce, crab meat and salmon eggs with sauce, really like it!
Mysterious menu-Carbon roasted Ibili pig and Italian pickled kimchi, I like this too!
Peeling pepper chicken stewed rice-the combination of tabletop and Italian, there is no sense of disobedience!This kind of foreign cuisine is great success!
Visiting restaurants!"
"麥片鮮嫩雞腿塊 - 表皮炸的比較酥脆，小小的刮嘴，但裡面的肉非常嫩非常多汁。
摩洛哥手打羊肉球 - 羊肉丸非常的紮實，羊肉味很濃烈，肉感十足，喜歡吃肉的人不要錯過。搭配番茄基底的醬汁和烤餅很不錯。
藍鑽蟹肉餅佐味增海膽醬 - 這道大推，蟹肉的味道很充足，搭配鮭魚卵的鮮味真的一絕。吃起來微微的帶著蟹肉的纖維感，而且非常軟嫩。
脆煎紅條石斑佐海膽風味麵 - 石斑魚很嫩很好吃。底下的麵也很棒，麵條有嚼勁，醬汁也是濃濃的海膽味，也不會太膩。
威靈頓半熟鮪魚排佐檸檬曙光醬 - 第一次吃威靈頓風格的料理。個人感覺很不錯，鮪魚很新鮮，也處理的很嫩，搭配外面的微甜酥皮吃起來很特別。
提拉米蘇 - 很不錯，味道很剛好，不會太甜，加了一點咖啡凍增加口感。
酒的部分個人沒有研究，完全喝不懂哈哈。
整體來說是一家很棒的餐酒館，餐點精緻好吃，裝潢氛圍也很棒，空間寬敞舒適，服務的態度也很棒。謝謝店家招待一杯調酒！","Macular tender chicken legs -the skin is more crispy and small scrape, but the meat inside is very tender and juicy.
Morocco's hand -playing mutton ball -lamb balls are very solid, lamb taste is strong and full of meat. Don't miss people who like meat.The sauce and barbecue with tomato base are very good.
Blue diamond crab meat cake Saidaipinaa -this big push, the crab meat taste is sufficient, with the umami flavor of salmon eggs.It tastes slightly with the fiber of crab meat, and is very soft.
Crispy red stripe grouper with a biliary flavor -grouper is very tender and delicious.The noodles below are also great, the noodles are chewy, and the sauce is also strong in sea urchin, and it will not be too greasy.
Wellington's half -cooked catfish row lemon dawn sauce -the first time I eat Wellington style dishes.Personally feel very good, the catfish is fresh, and it is also very tender. It tastes special with the slightly sweet plasma outside.
Tiramisu -very good, the taste is just right, it will not be too sweet, add a little coffee frozen to increase the taste.
Part of the wine did not study, and I couldn't understand it at all haha.
On the whole, it is a great dining tavern. The meal is delicate and delicious, the decoration atmosphere is also great, the space is spacious and comfortable, and the attitude of service is also great.Thank you for entertaining a glass of bartending!"
"吧台服務0分。其餘的都很有水準。

入門應對的經理，在入座時的說明及離去的問候得宜。

餐點部分，伊比利豬的柔嫩程度，令人驚艷，尚未入口時的炭香、加上鳳梨醬汁的點綴，非常好。
（蟹肉莎莎太厚實了～輕盈些比較好咬、油膩感也比較不會吃進皮裡太多）

飲料部分，signature 特調的nuts banana口味很好，所以後來又點了Gin tonic也是中規中距，再點mojito當作最後爽口的結尾。
沒想到mojito整杯像是喝酒精，我非常欣賞你們送來的杯子冷凍過，維持飲料的低溫。但是喝進去時酒精濃厚到發苦，沒有檸檬沒有甜甚至連薄荷的氣息都幾乎沒有。
我本來懷疑上面琥珀色的topping是深色蘭姆酒（如附圖1）。想跟服務人員確認，她雖然無法立即回應我，還是很積極的用headset去溝通，後來來了一個bartender,我想問他上面加什麼，他大哥超級不禮貌不客氣的說，我用什麼什麼rum取代氣泡水。
但其實當下慶祝我生日，實在不想破壞心情。
無論你對你的特調有什麼想法，但是難喝死了。你可以回應是不是需要調整飲料口味？或是甚至你對自己調出的飲料沒有那麼一絲一毫好奇是否有問題想taste看看？

總之這家餐廳，我會再訪，餐點值得再吃，外場服務其實也算友善及積極。但是飲料建議點可樂,或是以後直接開瓶wine.不用讓對自己recipe很有自信的bartender覺得好像客人在找碴。","The bar service is 0 points.The rest are very standard.

The entry -level manager's explanation and greetings at the time of attendance are appropriate.

In the meal part, the tenderness of the Iberbille pig is amazing. It is very good.
(Crab Shasha is too thick ~ light is better to bite, and the greasy feeling can not eat too much in the skin)

In the drink section, the Nuts Banana's special Nuts Banana has a good taste, so later I ordered Gin Tonic to be a satisfactory mid -range, and then click Mojito as the end of the refreshing end.
I did not expect that Mojito's whole cup seemed to drink alcohol. I appreciated the cups you sent very frozen and maintained the low temperature of the drink.But when drinking it, the alcohol is so hard that there is no lemon without sweetness or even the breath of mint.
I originally suspected that the amber Topping above was dark Rim (as shown in Figure 1).I want to confirm with the service staff that although she cannot respond to me immediately, she still uses HeadSet to communicate with him. Later, a Bartender came. I want to ask him what to add above. Rum replaces bubble water.
But in fact, celebrating my birthday nowadays, I really don't want to destroy my mood.
No matter what you think of your special adjustment, it is difficult to drink.Can you respond? Do you need to adjust the taste of beverage?Or is it that you are not so curious about the drinks you call out, do you think about it?

In short, I will visit this restaurant. The meal is worth eating again. Outside service is actually friendly and positive.But drinking cola, or opening the bottle directly in the future. Don't let Bartender, who is very confident in your recipe, feel like a guest is looking for a puppet."
"歐陸和地中海菜系，燉煮海鮮與肉類，佐以清新的香料風格和橄欖油，風味很不錯，但是控制出餐的節奏及告知客人準備餐點等待時間的服務不行！
前面幾樣麵包、前菜、調酒、薯條出得很快，但主菜卻隔了約40分鐘，跟櫃檯的女性服務人員反應（看起來應該是主管級），她給的答案是說：她們會觀察客人用餐的速度來出餐。若是這樣，那你前幾樣出那麼快是怎樣？第一道也還沒吃完，你就把第二、三、四道通通端上桌了！然後等主餐又等了那麼久，用餐節奏都被你們打亂了，看看其他桌的客人，也都是在等待餐點等的臉都很臭了…真不知你們是如何在控制、觀察每桌客人的用餐速度…如果沒有跟你們催餐，是不是要等到一個小時可能都還沒看到餐點上桌。
結帳時，跟另外一個男性服務員（看起來也是比較資深的）反應，又說了另一種說辭，說今天的單爆了，而且缺人，所以餐點出得慢，那你們讓客人等的這段時間也都沒有向客人解釋啊！真的吃到火都上來了！

炭烤海鮮沙拉佐檸檬白酒油醋$480:有透抽、白蝦、白鯷魚、煙燻起司、綜合生菜，白蝦應該是有炙燒過，真的非常香，白鯷魚有點鹹，搭配沙拉的醬汁很清爽，整體味道很不錯。

佛卡夏$80:麵包也不錯，搭配的沾醬酸甜酸甜的，也可以跟店員要奶油來配著吃。

酥炸蟹肉莎莎$320: 帝王蟹味棒、自製莎莎醬蟹肉塔塔，味道也不錯，只是若用真正的蟹肉會更好！

Singapore Sling新加坡司令$400 ：南洋島嶼風的經典調酒，好喝！

炸海鹽胡椒薯條$230:這個真的很普通，建議不要點～

威靈頓半熟鮪魚排佐檸檬曙光醬$1180: 鮪魚、酥皮、自製蘑菇泥、番茄檸檬奶油醬，鮪魚處理的不錯，不會有鮪魚的魚腥味…

📍每人低消$800，私人包箱低消$1,500，酌收10%服務費。","The European and Mediterranean sea vegetables, stewed seafood and meat, with fresh spice style and olive oil, the flavor is very good, but the rhythm of controlling meals and informing the guests to prepare for meals for waiting time are not good!
A few of the previous bread, front dishes, bartending, and fries were very fast, but the main dish was separated by about 40 minutes. She responded to the female service staff at the counter (it should be the supervisor level). The answer she gave was: They will observe the speed of guests to go out for meals.If so, how are you so fast before?Before the first way, you have not finished eating it, you will be on the table second, third, and fourth!Then wait for the main meal for so long, the rhythm of the meal has been disrupted by you. Look at the guests at other tables, and the face waiting for meals is very stinky ... I don’t know how you are controlling and observing The meal speed of each table of guests ... If you do n’t have a meal with you, do you have to wait for an hour and you may not see the meal at the table.
When checking out, I reacted with another male waiter (it seemed to be more senior), and said another rhetoric that today's single explosion, and the lack of people, so the meal is slow, then you let the guests wait I did not explain to the guests during this time!I really came up with the fire!

Carbon -grilled seafood salad lemon white wine oil vinegar $ 480: there are soy sauce, white shrimp, white catfish, smoky cheese, comprehensive lettuce, white shrimp should have been burned, really fragrant, white catfish is a bit salty, The salad with salad is refreshing and the overall taste is very good.

Foxia $ 80: The bread is also good. The sticky sauce is sour and sweet, and you can also use cream to eat with the clerk.

Crispy crab meat Salsa $ 320: Emperor crab flavor stick, homemade Sasha sauce crab meat tower, the taste is also good, but it will be better if it uses real crab meat!

Singapore Sling Singapore Commander $ 400: Classic bartending of Nanyang Island style, delicious!

Fried sea salt peppercorns $ 230: This is really ordinary, it is recommended not to order ~

Wellington's half -cooked catfish steak lemon dawn sauce $ 1180: catfish, plasma, homemade mushroom mud, tomato lemon cream sauce, catfish is good, there will be no fish fishy smell of catfish ...

8 Each person has a low consumption of $ 800, and the private box consumes a lower $ 1,500."
"適合慶生氣氛很好，也適合朋友聚餐小酌
餐點也很用心，酒單也很有特色
臨時請店員在蛋糕上裝飾生日祝福也非常樂意配合，但希望下次可以協助提醒有每月壽星蛋糕🤣","Suitable for the birthday atmosphere is good, and it is also suitable for friends to dinner
The meal is also very attentive, and the wine list is also very distinctive
Temporary asked the shop clerk to decorate birthday blessings on the cake, but I hope to help remind you to have a monthly Shouxing cake next time."
"#生活小食記
#不是優惠才寫評論

與先生來用餐，覺得環境很舒適，音樂有種慵懶放鬆感搭配燈光氛圍，覺得很喜歡🫶🏻

餐點的部分，以下是不專業的紀錄分享
（每個人喜歡的口味本來就不同，沒有對錯）

迎賓小湯品-柴魚香喝起來蠻舒服的

今日例湯-海鮮蕃茄湯
本來以為是很番茄的海鮮湯，結果是很香微濃郁的海鮮蟹膏番茄味，搭配鮮蝦與透抽，覺得很想再來一碗！ 湯品的量覺得稍微少了一點，希望可以在多一點！

前菜-紹興油泡海鮮
本身就很喜歡麵包沾橄欖油的吃法，這道菜的海鮮搭配麵包與紹興油，可以吃到鮮蝦微炭烤香，推！

前菜-藍鑽蟹肉餅佐海膽醬
超愛吃螃蟹的我，吃完這道真的就是快樂🎊
味道調味都很剛好，搭配鮭魚卵，會想下次再來吃一次。（口感很像在茹絲葵吃到的蟹肉糕🥰）

燉飯-剝皮辣椒雞燉飯
吃得出來是用義大利米去烹調的，是屬於米粒口感比較明顯的，如果喜歡吃軟一點的燉飯，建議一定要問看看服務員能不能煮軟一點喲！
微辣的剝皮辣椒搭配煎的酥脆的雞腿，很不一樣的風味！ 建議一定要燉飯搭配上面他們烘烤的起司片，會有不同的口感！

主菜-威靈頓「鮪魚」
之前去吃過米其林的法餐威靈頓牛排，就愛上威靈頓☺️這次來嘗試看看搭配鮪魚！本來內心很希望是牛排，吃到餐點後覺得原來鮪魚也很不錯！！ 外皮酥脆，旁邊的配菜有點炭烤香，推薦！

晚上7點多，客人更多的時候，環境有稍微變得比較熱鬧，但整體的體驗是很舒服又美味的🫶🏻","#生活 记 notes
#Not a discount to write comments

Come to dinner with Mr., I feel that the environment is very comfortable, and the music has a lazy and loose feeling with the light atmosphere. I feel like I like it.

The part of the meal, the following is an unprofessional record sharing
(The taste that everyone likes is different, there is no right or wrong)

Yingbin Xiaotang-Chai Fuxiang is quite comfortable to drink

Today's Example Soup-Seafood Tomato Soup
I thought it was a very tomato seafood soup. As a result, it was very fragrant seafood crab paste tomato flavor. With fresh shrimp and pumping, I felt like I wanted to have another bowl!The amount of soup feels a little less, I hope it can be a little more!

Qiancai-Shaoxing Oil Publly Seafood
I really like the method of eating olive oil with bread. The seafood of this dish is paired with bread and Shaoxing oil.

Previous dish-blue diamond crab cake Zuo sea urchin sauce
I love crab, I am really happy after eating this.
The flavor and seasoning are just right. With salmon eggs, you will want to eat again next time.(The taste is very much like the crab cake eaten in Ruskui 🥰)

Stewed rice-peeling pepper chicken stew rice
It can be cooked with Italian rice. It belongs to the rice grain and is more obvious. If you like to eat a softer stew, it is recommended to ask if the waiter can cook a softer!
The slightly spicy pepper pepper with the crispy chicken leg, very different flavor!It is recommended to stew rice with the cheese fillets they baked above, which will have a different taste!

Main cuisine-Wellington ""catfish""
I have been to eat Michelin's French meal Velidon steak before, and I fell in love with Wellington ☺️ This time I try to see with catfish!I originally hoped that it was steak. After eating, I felt that catfish was also very good!IntersectionThe outer skin is crispy, and the side dishes next to it are a bit charcoal grilled. It is recommended!

At 7 o'clock in the evening, when the guests are more, the environment has become slightly lively, but the overall experience is very comfortable and delicious 🫶🏻"
"菜品的呈現與菜單一致 視覺效果精緻

奶油跟馬鈴薯泥為菜品增添一些濃郁風味

剝皮辣椒雞燉飯🥘
燉飯口感濕潤綿密 米芯軟硬適中

"今日幫朋友慶生，剛入座就有開胃暖暖的柴魚湯，還有親切優秀的服務員，點菜清楚的說明和用餐期間適時地收拾桌面，一切都很剛好👍

餐點的部分被海鮮沙拉驚艷，炙烤過的海鮮香氣十足，另外伊比利豬排煎的很軟嫩，搭配上玫瑰鹽風味就很夠了，反倒是旁邊的莓果醬，有個油蔥味不討喜（個人討厭油蔥啦😅)，波隆那義大利麵的部分相較於其他菜餚就中規中矩，但還是很好吃的啦~

酒精不論是特別調酒或是經典調酒都很優秀，也都能依照口味去做調整和建議，飯後還有招待的慶生提拉米蘇，裡面有層咖啡凍超好吃~甜度很剛好，也足夠濕潤，真是很滿足的一餐，也謝謝店長最後送了ByeBye shot，是好喝的龍舌蘭呀~

今晚也剛好有小提琴演奏，表演曲目耳熟能詳，豐富了這個夜晚🥰","Today, helping friends celebrate his birthday. As soon as you take place, you will have appetizing firewood soup, as well as kindergarten waiters, clearly describes the description and timely packing during the meal.

The part of the meal was stunned by seafood salad, and the seafood aroma was full of seafood. In addition, the Iberry pigs were fried and tender, and the flavor of rose salt was enough. Requesting (I hate shallots), the part of Polona's Italian noodles is quite satisfactory compared to other dishes, but it is still delicious ~

Whether alcohol is special or classic bartending, it is excellent, and you can make adjustments and suggestions according to the taste. There are also entertaining celebration Titamisu after meals. Just right, it is also humid enough. It is really a very satisfying meal. Thank you for the manager to give Byebye Shot in the end. It is a delicious agave ~

Tonight also happened to have a violin performance. The performance of the performance is familiar, which enriched this night."
"我覺得能夠服務跟食物都很好的餐廳很難得👍本來時間還沒到我就先在店門口等朋友來，結果服務人員走出來讓我先入座看菜單，這點就覺得好貼心好加分🥹🫶
然後餐點真的不用說…本來不吃海鮮的我，吃了酥炸蟹肉莎莎覺得這道很可以！
酥脆千層馬鈴薯也讓我很驚艷，而主菜剝皮辣椒義大利麵、牛排等真的不用多說，都很厲害也很好吃❤️甜點提拉米蘇也很棒，甜度適中入口即化🤤
服務人員對我們也都很親切，雖然上面有寫用餐時間限制，但當天週五晚上我們也沒有被提醒用餐時間到了要結帳～這家餐廳是我會再回訪的店，已加入口袋名單🫶","I think that the restaurant that can be able to serve and eat well is hard to come. Before I arrived, I waited for friends at the door of the store. As a result, the service staff came out and let me take a seat to see the menu. Bleak
Then I really do n’t need to say ... I did n’t eat seafood at all.
The crispy thousand -layer potato also surprised me, and the main cuisine peeled pepper pasta, steak, etc. Needless to say, it is very good and delicious ❤️ dessert Tiramisu is also great, the sweetness of the sweetness is moderate. Bleak
The service staff is also very kind to us. Although there is a time limit for meals on it, we have not been reminded to check out on Friday night on Friday night. This restaurant is a store I will return to."
今天第一次來這家餐廳用餐，原本訂了六人的位子，後來改成八人，沒想到店家特別貼心，為了不讓我們太擁擠，還主動幫我們安排到包廂。包廂的隔音效果非常好，讓我們能盡情聊天。餐點不僅美味，整體氛圍也很不錯，但最值得稱讚的是他們的服務態度。特別是那位年輕的妹妹服務員，她的表現真的很棒，應該給她加薪才對！🤣,"I came to this restaurant for the first time today. I originally ordered the seat of six people. Later, it was changed to eight. I did not expect that the store was particularly intimate. In order not to let us be too crowded, we also took the initiative to help us arrange to the box.The sound insulation effect of the box is very good, so that we can chat.The meal is not only delicious, but the overall atmosphere is also very good, but the most praise is their service attitude.Especially the younger sister waiter, her performance is really great, she should pay her salary!Bleak"
威靈頓鮪魚、剝皮辣椒雞燉飯、松露馬鈴薯千層、蟹肉餅、松阪豬都好吃。芭樂調酒相當特別，用濾杯過濾三次的芭樂汁澄澈有香氣。好評！,"Wellington catfish, peeling pepper chicken stewed rice, magching potato thousands of layers, crab cakes, Matsusaka pigs are delicious.Bavail bartending is quite special. The bartender with a filter cup is clear and aroma.Praise!"
"一進門外場帶位服務很周到！燈光氣氛都很好🥰廁所甚至有附單包裝的漱口水 很貼心～招待的柴魚湯喝起來很香 柴魚味濃厚熱熱的很暖胃 如果可以單點會很想點來喝！

📌花椒松露薯條

內場人員很細心，舉手馬上就能看到並提醒服務人員過來點餐，環境乾淨，好棒的餐酒館讓我有美好的約會，會再次光顧。","So lucky!Today, there are violin performances. I usually have not encountered violin performances. They are usually singing and piano. Originally, they started to be love songs. After one or two songs, music became more and more hilarious. The interaction with the guests was very generous and the atmosphere was very good.

The meal is exquisite and fresh, and the two seas salads are just right.

The internal staff is very careful. I can see and remind the service staff to come and order for meals. The environment is clean. The great dining tavern allows me to have a good date and I will patronize again."
"很適合約會、用餐、慶生的好地方
壽星可以享有一份提拉米蘇蛋糕🍰

The restaurant space is good in large position
But it ’s because I was sitting on the opposite side loudly.
I still want to go back to visit because the pastoral noodles and stewed rice are great
Crab Pork is delicious"
"食物勝過氛圍和酒水的餐酒館！

老實說酒水中規中矩，但食物整體的水準真的不錯。至於環境設計的部分走簡易的地中海風，算是一個大場地，桌數多，自然人也多。

唯一最不喜歡的是夏天去的時候超級多蚊子！不知道為什麼室內有那麼多蚊子，離開的時候兩腳都是小包。好希望當時候有阻止員工拔掉液體電蚊香啊。","Food is better than the atmosphere and wine restaurant!

Honestly, the wine is quite satisfactory, but the level of food as a whole is really good.As for the environmental design part of the simple Mediterranean style, it is a large venue. There are many tables and many natural people.

The only one that dislikes is that when you go in summer, you are super mosquito!I don't know why there are so many mosquitoes indoors, and their feet are small bags when they leave.I hope that at that time, there were preventing employees from unplugging the liquid electric mosquito coils."
"前菜推薦蟹肉莎莎那道，主菜伊比利豬非常多汁非常嫩！甜點推薦提拉米蘇，酒味很醇厚不甜膩，燉飯及義大利麵則較為普通。
餐廳氣氛佳，非常適合過節。服務很周到，貼心備至，看到我們手髒了，就馬上拿濕紙巾給我們擦拭。謝謝你們～","The former dish is recommended to Crab Sasha, the main dish Ibilia pig is very juicy and tender!Dessert recommends Tiramisu. The wine taste is very mellow and not sweet, and stewed rice and pasta are more ordinary.
The restaurant has a good atmosphere and is very suitable for the holiday.The service is very thoughtful and intimate, and when we see that we are dirty, we immediately wipe us with a wet paper towel.Thank you ~"
主打歐陸菜色，融合台灣在地食材，以創意料理著稱，調酒亦不讓餐點專美於前，時常聘請客座調酒師，並可客製化打造出理想風味，浪漫地中海風情，愜意自在，是一間令人放鬆、舒心的中山區餐酒館，適合約會的餐廳、慶生餐廳。,"It mainly focuses on European and contains, integrates Taiwan's local ingredients, known for creative cuisine, and does not allow meals to be beautiful before. I often hire a guest bartender, and can customize the ideal flavor, romantic Mediterranean style, comfortable and comfortable It is a relaxed and comfortable Zhongshan dining tavern, suitable for dating restaurants and celebration restaurants."
"續攤找的店，但Google Map的導向卻是店家的後門處，不得其門而入的我們正準備要放棄，附近店家的店員剛好出來，就幫我們指了路（感覺對方很熟練XD），這根本就是一個沒問對NPC就無法開啟的副本任務（笑）。

店內空間挺大，酒也不賴，這次雖然只有喝酒，有機會也想來吃吃這裡的餐飲。

----------
【花椒松露薯條】
松露薯條挺常見，但帶有花椒風味就讓我很好奇了，花椒風味主要來自於沾醬，還挺不賴。

【芭樂】
芭樂與甜羅勒還挺搭，帶點柚子醋酸和馬告香氣，酒感輕。

【大吉大荔】
酸甜調偏水果甜，主要是荔枝與蜜李的風味，酒感輕。

【梅arry Me】
一直覺得威士忌和桂花很搭，酸甜調偏醋酸，帶有淡淡桂花香，酒感中等偏輕。

【海王星】
風味挺神奇，偏重蜂蜜甜和小黃瓜風味，酒感中等偏輕。

【水梨】
茶感很輕，主要是威士忌和水梨甜風味，又有點野薑花的香氣，酒感輕。","The shop searched for the stall, but the guide of Google Map is the back door of the store. We are not allowed to enter the door. This is simply a copy task that cannot be opened for NPC (laughs).

The space in the store is quite large and the wine is not bad. Although there is only drinking this time, I have the opportunity to come to eat the catering here.

-----------
【Pepper of Pepper Truffe French French French French French French French French French Fries
Tulled fries are very common, but with the flavor of peppercorns, I am curious. The flavor of peppercorns mainly comes from dipping sauce, which is not bad.

【Barr】
Barr and sweet Lales are quite good, with a little grapefruit acetic acid and the aroma of the horse, and the wine feels light.

【Daji Dali】
Sweet and sour tone is sweet and sweet, mainly the flavor of lychee and honey, and the wine feels light.

【Mery Me】
I have always felt that the whiskey and osmanthus are very good. The sweet and sour tone is a acetic acid, with a light osmanthus aroma, and the wine feels medium and light.

【Neptune】
The flavor is amazing, and the flavor of honey is sweet and small cucumber.

【Pear】
The tea feels very light, mainly the sweet flavor of whiskey and pear, and a bit of the aroma of wild ginger flowers, and the wine feels light."
"餐點真的很好吃，沒有雷
服務很好，有餐館的輕鬆，卻有法式餐廳的服務
素食的餐點有燉飯跟義大麵的選擇
味道夠，又能吃到食材的新鮮
很棒的餐廳","The meal is really delicious, there is no thunder
The service is very good, there is a restaurant easy, but the service of French restaurants
Vegetarian meals include the choice of stewed rice and rumor noodles
The taste is enough, and you can eat the freshness of the ingredients
Great restaurant"
"食物滿不行的
份量不多、剝皮辣椒雞肉的燉飯很鹹
選擇不多
女生的服務員對於餐桌上的調酒活動不是很熟，那個奶味不是牛奶的奶，而是很抽象的奶味（是一杯透明很甜的酒）
男生高高的服務員非常讚，服務很好之外，對於菜單也比較了解","Food
Stewed rice with small portion, peeling pepper chicken is salty
Not much choice
Girls' waiters are not very familiar with the bartending activities on the table. The milk flavor is not milk of milk, but a very abstract milk flavor (it is a cup of transparent and sweet wine)
The tall waiter of the boys is very good, the service is very good, and I also know the menu more about the menu"
"剝皮辣椒雞超級好吃
莎莎蟹肉也好吃
牡蠣好吃
布朗尼有點小份XD
幾乎每道菜都很讚！可以多點幾樣不然被吃不飽","Peeling pepper chicken is super delicious
Shasan crab meat is delicious too
Oyster delicious
Browni is a little bit XD
Almost every dish is very good!You can get a little more, otherwise you can't be full"
這家店的CP值真的太低了，鮪魚威靈頓要1100，但是只有三片，根本就吃不飽，重點是也不好吃。點了一個100ml 的海鮮濃湯要加180，我從來沒有看過這麼小份量的海鮮濃湯。結帳要快1500，拜託不要再來了，評價是洗出來的，而且裡面的氣氛要高級不高級，絕對會後悔,"The CP value of this shop is really too low. The catfish Willington wants 1100, but there are only three pieces, and you can't eat it at all. The point is not delicious.I ordered a 100ml seafood soup to add 180. I have never seen such a small amount of seafood soup.The checkout should be faster 1500. Please don't come again."
"與朋友聚餐～
餐廳氣氛很好，餐點、酒好喝，老闆超熱情的.","Dinner with friends ~
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good, the meals, wine are delicious, and the boss is very enthusiastic."
"有點隱密的餐酒館，裝潢風格有點夜店開放式包廂感，座位跟桌子間距都很寬敞很舒適，燈光偏昏暗，餐點選擇滿多的，飲品也有酒精及非酒精可選，整體用餐體驗不錯。

蜜鴨胸沙拉佐香橙油醋
鴨胸軟嫩好吃，不過韌到咬不動，生菜種類滿多的也都很新鮮，還有加上橘子瓣及堅果口感很豐富，不過香橙味的油醋感覺不是特別明顯。

酥炸蟹肉莎莎
雖然只有 2 pcs，但其實1個份量就滿大的，也很適合切塊分食，麵包表皮非常酥脆，而且除了上方的蟹肉，裡面也是塞得滿滿滿，莎莎醬僅薄薄一層，口味新鮮獨特。

炸 真的鱈魚條
就是可以想像的鱈魚條的味道，無特別之處。

索蘭諾火腿黑松露白披薩
披薩是薄脆皮，邊咀嚼邊會散發出麵粉香氣，松露跟火腿的口味搭配也很適合，不過如果期待被松露味爆擊，這款可能達不到，但整體非常和諧好吃，還是很推薦。

威靈頓半熟鮪魚排
難得少見威靈頓裡面包得是鮪魚排，算是很新奇的組合，但可能有點放涼了，或本來鮪魚的油脂分布比較少，在口味上感覺缺少了點油脂混合酥皮的香氣也偏乾，夾層的蘑菇醬有點沒有存在感。

南洋紅醬海鮮義大利麵
上桌時軟殼蟹的視覺效果很震撼，口味是有點微辣的紅醬混合著海鮮及椰奶的甜味，海鮮種類不多，但新鮮Q彈，醬汁也有緊緊的巴在麵條上。

剝皮辣椒雞燉飯
燉飯就是要吃這種有保留米心口感的，口味確實也是剝皮辣椒，但甜味大過於辣味滿多的，雞肉是好吃的不乾柴。","A little hidden dining tavern, the decoration style is a bit of the nightclub open box, the distance between the seats and the table is very spacious and comfortable, the lights are dim, the meals are full, and the drinks have alcohol and non -alcoholic options. The overall meal experience is good Essence

Honey duck chest salad salad orange oil vinegar
The duck breasts are soft and delicious, but they are so tough that they can't bite. There are many types of lettuce, and they are also very fresh. There are also orange petals and nuts. However, orange -flavored oil vinegar feels not particularly obvious.

Crispy Crab Misa
Although there are only 2 PCS, in fact, the amount of a portion is large, and it is very suitable for cutting into pieces. The bread epidermis is very crispy, and in addition to the crab meat above, it is full. The taste is fresh and unique.

Fried cod bar
It is the taste of cod bars that can be imagined. There is nothing special.

Solano ham black loose and white pizza
Pizza is crispy and crispy, and it will emit the aroma of flour while chewing. The taste of truffles and ham is also very suitable, but if you look forward to being hit by truffle flavor, this may not be able to reach, but the overall is very harmonious and delicious. It is still very recommended. Essence

Wellington Semi -Cooked Curdine Rank
It is rare to rare Wellington to bread the catfish row, which is a very novel combination, but it may be a bit cool, or the grease distribution of the original catfish is relatively small. Dry, the mezzanine sauce is a bit unwilling to have a sense of existence.

Nanyang red sauce seafood pasta
The visual effect of soft shell crabs was shocking when serving. The taste is a little spicy red sauce mixed with the sweetness of seafood and coconut milk. There are not many types of seafood, but fresh Q bombs and sauce are also tight on the noodles on the noodles. Essence

Peeling pepper chicken stew rice
Stewed rice is to eat this kind of rice heart, and the taste is indeed peeling peppers, but the sweetness is too spicy and full of flavor. Chicken is delicious and not dry firewood."
"氛圍意外不錯的餐酒館
慶生推薦 有提拉米蘇
餐點的部分也都有一定水準
但酒的部分普普","The atmosphere is unexpectedly good
Recommended by the birthday is Tiramisu
The meals are also at a certain level
But part of the wine"
"調酒“梅”好喝
蟹肉莎莎不錯吃，但就是能想到的味道
千層馬鈴薯不推，剝皮辣椒燉飯沒記憶點，羊肉球的麵包很有咬勁，好吃","Banjin ""plum"" is delicious
Crab Salsa is good, but it is the taste that can be thought of
Thousand -layer potato does not push, peeling pepper stewed rice without memory, the bread of the lamb ball is very bitter, delicious"
"超難吃 尤其是燉飯類 到底在幹嘛⋯然後超貴 一個人低消800 還可以亂做餐點 我服了
評價騙人的 幾年前的評價是真實的
花錢請人表演 不如好好研究如何做出有水準符合價位的燉飯？ 假水準真演出名副其實

我跟朋友回家都拉了肚子⋯⋯實在太扯了 評論洗出來的？！","Super hard to eat, especially what is stewed rice, and then I can make meals for meals when I am too expensive to consume 800.
The evaluation of the evaluation a few years ago was real
It is better to spend money to perform how to make a good level of stew with a standard price?Fake level real performances

I went home with my friends and I pulled my stomach. I was too much to comment?Intersection"
"環境舒適，尤其是內部裝潢營造的跟空間感很讓人舒服。

食物以這類型的餐酒館來說價錢算合理，且份量非常足夠。但個人感覺味道吃起來比較容易膩口，沒有太多驚艷的感覺。","The environment is comfortable, especially the sense of space created by interior decoration is very comfortable.

The price of food is reasonable for this type of restaurant, and the portion is very sufficient.But I personally feel that it tastes easier to taste, there is not much amazing feeling."
氣氛好 餐點讚 份量很多不怕不夠吃,"The atmosphere is good, like a lot, a lot, not afraid of eating"
"東西好吃，菜色很用心調味細緻
服務員親切友善，適合聚會慶生","The stuff is delicious, the dishes are very delicate and delicate,
The waiter is friendly and friendly, suitable for party celebration"
"最喜歡明太子開胃菜！蟹肉莎莎最高！

肉醬麵第一口覺得好吃，但吃到後來覺得很鹹很甜很膩
剝皮辣椒雞燉飯的味道有點難以言喻，甜甜的，米飯的口感也很奇特，沒有飯的感覺。","Favorite Prince Ming appetizer!Crab Salsa is the highest!

The first bite of the meat sauce noodles feels delicious, but after eating it, I feel salty, sweet, and greasy.
The taste of peeling pepper chicken stew is a bit incomprehensible, sweet, the taste of rice is also strange, and there is no feeling of rice."
"東西很好吃～就是餐點很容易破800元低消。
一開始的柴魚昆布高湯裝飾的像玫瑰一樣送上來暖胃，還不錯

酒很漂亮，這次點了大吉大利，但我本身不太會喝酒～所以不太懂好壞。

食物真的很推 ，蟹肉莎莎（有點在吃高級沙拉船蟹肉版本的），蘑菇燉飯（米很特別 有米心又吸飽蘑菇的香氣），黑松露白披薩（芝麻葉在火腿上真的絕配）","Things are delicious ~ It is easy to break 800 yuan in meals.
At the beginning, the firewood Kunbu broth was decorated like a rose to warm the stomach, which is not bad.

The wine is very beautiful, this time I ordered Great Great, but I don't know how to drink it ~ so I don't know how good or bad.

The food is really pushing, Crab Salsa (a bit eating a high -end salad boat crab meat version), mushroom stew (rice is particularly rice heart and the aroma of mushrooms), black pine dew white pizza (sesame leaves on the ham Really perfect)"
"這家餐酒館令人驚艷
今天來吃他們四月份的新菜色
大推前菜千層馬鈴薯佐玉米醬，酥脆的千層馬鈴薯跟甜味醬汁的契合感很好吃，剝皮辣椒雞燉飯也跟坊間餐酒館的燉飯不同，很有自己的特色，外場特別推薦的摩洛哥手工羊肉球是必點，超讓人驚艷，服務也很棒！這家餐酒館很值得再訪","This restaurant is amazing
Come to eat their new dishes in April today
Pushing Qiancai Thousand -layer potato sauce, crispy thousand -layer potato and sweet sauce are delicious, peeling pepper chicken stewed rice is also different from the stew of the dining tavern. It has its own characteristics. The specially recommended Moroccan handmade mutton ball is a must, it is amazing, and the service is great!This restaurant is worth visiting again"
"低消一人800+10%
氣氛很棒 裝潢漂亮適合約會 可惜沒有現場表演
東西好吃但吃到後面有點膩
炸物食材新鮮 吃得出海鮮本身甜味但麵皮偏厚 前菜馬鈴薯還好上菜沒有馬上吃完就不會想吃了
兩人點了兩個前菜一個炸物拼盤一份燉飯很飽","Low one person 800+10%
The atmosphere is great, the decoration is beautiful, it is a pity that there is no live performance
It is delicious but a bit tired after eating
Frying ingredients fresh can be eaten by seafood itself, but the noodles are thick but the noodles are thick before the vegetable potato.
The two ordered two previous dishes, a frying platter, a piece of stew, a full of rice"
男朋友訂完位之後才發現前年和家人已經來吃過了，餐點和過去一樣都非常好吃，只是威靈頓的部分原本跟我們說大概等30分鐘，最後等了一個小時😅,"After the boyfriend finished the position, I found out that I had eaten with my family the previous year. The meals were very delicious as the past, but the part of Wellington originally told us about 30 minutes, and finally waited for an hour. 😅 😅 😅 😅 😅"
"這間店的餐點在一定水準上，尤其是有蟹肉的前菜點了不會失望，想必是幾隻蟹才能集合成滿滿的餡料。煎魚海膽麵收汁也收的很完美，麵也是有一定的嚼勁。酒的話如果對薑不排斥可以點服務員推薦的薑汁口味的伏特加基底酒，以銅杯盛上。
值得一提的是服務員清一色是細心的男生，看到沒有刀會隨手附上，見旁桌有慶生蛋糕，隨口問了本月壽星有蛋糕嗎？服務員也是大方的送上蛋糕，廁所還有放護墊。總之無論是帶客戶或重要的人都很合適。
美中不足的就是第一次來找路有點吃力，基本上找到錢櫃正對面預售屋的巷子走進來左轉就到了。","The meal of this shop is at a certain level, especially the front dish with crab meat will not be disappointed. Presumably a few crabs can be gathered into full stuffing.The fried fish and sea urchin noodles are also perfectly collected, and the noodles are also chewy.If you do n’t exclude ginger, you can order the Vodga -based wine recommended by the waiter.
It is worth mentioning that the waiter Qing Yixi was a careful boy. When he saw that there was no knife, he would attach it at hand. Seeing that there was a birthday cake on the side table, did he ask if there is a cake of Shouxing this month?The waiter is also generous to send cakes, and the toilet also has a care pad.In short, it is appropriate to bring customers or important people.
The disadvantage of the United States is the first time to find a way to find the way. Basically, the alleys of the pre -sale house directly opposite the cash cabinet came in and left."
"這裡紅白酒非常好喝
餐點也很好吃燉飯米心讓人非常喜愛，薯條炸得不油膩，提拉米蘇沒有什麼浸潤的酒味比較可惜
整體是個讓人很放鬆的地方，來演奏的小提琴家演奏得很不賴，但大家太專注聊天，有點可惜…
然後希望晚上餐廳播放的音樂稍微慵懶點會更舒服😌
之後會再二訪😆","The dazzling red and white wine is very good
The meal is also very tasty stewed rice heart makes people very fond, fries are fried ugly, tiramisu spur what is immersed in the wine taste is unfortunate
Overall the can be relaxed, to play the violinist play very unfelted, but we are too focused on chat, a little unfortunate ...
Then I hope the restaurant plays music at night slightly slight lazy points will be more comfortable😌
Then will visit again😆"
"美味的餐酒館。最愛酥炸蟹肉莎莎。
壽星招待提拉米蘇超級好吃。","Delicious restaurant.Favorite crispy fried crab meat.
Shouxing entertained Tiramisu is super delicious."
很適合朋友來聚餐的地方～剛好遇到有小提琴演奏～～氣氛很好～餐點跟就都很不錯唷🥰🥰🥰🥰,It's very suitable for friends to dinner ~ Just meet a violin performance ~~ The atmosphere is very good ~ The meal is very good 唷
"環境很舒服但偏吵，服務很棒
餐點幾乎每道都好吃
最推剝皮辣椒燉飯&海鮮義大利麵
非常喜歡開胃的昆布湯
會再回訪的！","The environment is very comfortable but noisy, the service is great
Almost every meal is delicious
The most pushed peeling pepper stew & seafood pasta
I really like appetizing Kunbu Soup
Will return to visit again!"
酒量不好的人，推薦喝芭樂調酒，你不會失望，沙拉極度大推，主餐豬好吃，餐廳不踩雷，會再度光臨。,"People with poor alcohol, recommended to drink bartender, you will not be disappointed. Salads are extremely pushed, the main dining pig is delicious, and the restaurant does not step on the mine. It will come again."
"喜歡 酥炸馬鈴薯 馬鈴薯泥有松露❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
鮪魚🍣生魚片 也😋","Like crispy -fried potato potato puree with truffle ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Catfish 鱼 sashimi also 🍣"
"第一次來用餐，地點跟google上的定位有點不太一樣，還稍微找了一下。

招待的柴魚湯滿好喝的，餐點整體來說都好吃！
飯麵類服務生都有提醒要趁熱吃，不然冷掉會偏油膩。
調酒的部分口味都滿有特色的，但喜不喜歡就看個人了。有一個有加小黃瓜的我就蠻喜歡的，但朋友不喜歡😆。

當月壽星有招待一份提拉米蘇，鮮奶油比例比較多，蛋糕體比較少，但鮮奶油是好吃的，還不錯～
我們還被招待了一人一杯聖格利亞（不在酒單上），很好喝！

環境氣氛都很舒適，服務也很棒，是會再來訪的店👍","For the first time, the location is a bit different from the positioning on Google, and I found it a little.

The recruitment of the firewood soup is delicious, and the meal is delicious as a whole!
Noodles waiters have reminded to eat while hot, otherwise it will be greasy when it is cold.
The taste of the bartender is full of characteristics, but it depends on the individual if you like it.I like one with a small cucumber, but my friends don't like it.

In the month, Shouxing had a hospitality of Tiramisu. The proportion of fresh cream was more, and the cake body was relatively small, but the fresh cream was delicious, pretty good ~
We were also recruited one person and one cup of St. Gelia (not on the wine list), which was delicious!

The environmental atmosphere is very comfortable and the service is great."
"0.開胃昆布湯 裝法很特別
1. 炒野菇 酸甜味道濃厚
2. 鮪魚生魚片 外面熟裡面生 不太吃生魚片的也能吃得滿意 起司片搭配魚卵 鹹味點綴魚卵味 比單吃魚卵好上許多
3. (*)酥炸蟹肉莎莎 酥炸的潛艇堡的感覺？ 包蟹肉很棒 推薦
4. 廣島煎食追 要配醬吃 單吃就單純的菜味
5. 兩道炸物 牡蠣/鱈魚 皮是頗厚 只不過一吃就有點膩了 感想是不太需要點炸物區 我可能會換成義大利麵或披薩
6. 燉飯 (*)推薦剝皮辣椒雞口味 味道會積在嘴巴後方或喉頭處 但是不會有辣的不適感 相當特別的爽感 飯的顆粒比一般吃的飯要大 相形之下 後續吃松阪豬口味就只剩松阪的油膩 飯的味道也淡上許多 所以應該只需要點一個燉飯 免得比較淡的那個被影響
7. 經典臘腸披薩 真的就是經典味道 跟一般披薩店的一樣 也許應該點另一種口味 披薩主要是點來配酒 比配可樂更有「享受」的感覺
8. (*)菜單後面有200元的體驗調酒系列 可以加購 調酒點13 然後體驗區點15 這樣就完美
9. 本來還有一個壽星優惠 不過可能店員處理後面來的客人 所以忘記送了 應該是一個蛋糕
整體來說是相當滿意 不錯的體驗 生意不錯 時間到就只能離開了
（*）為自己再訪必點項目","0. The appetizer Kunbu soup is very special
1. Sweet and sour flavor of fried wild mushrooms
2. Those who do n’t eat sashimi inside the cooked fish sashimi inside them can also be satisfied with the cheese fillet with fish egg salty flavor.
3. (*) What is the feeling of the boss of the fried crab, Sasha?Crab meat is great recommended
4. Hiroshima fried food to chase sauce to eat it with simple dish flavor
5. Two fried oysters/cod peel is quite thick, but when you eat it, you feel a little tired. I do n’t need to order some fried area. I might change it to Italian noodles or pizza
6. Stew rice (*) Recommended peeling chili chicken flavor will accumulate behind your mouth or at the throat, but there will be no spicy discomfort. The taste of only the greasy rice of Mansaka is also lighter, so it should only be ordered to order a stewed rice to avoid the influence of the lighter.
7. Classic waxic pizza is really the same as the classic taste as the general pizza shop. Maybe another flavor pizza is mainly to use wine to match cola more.
8. (*) After the menu, there is a 200 yuan experience bartending series. You can buy a bartender point 13 and then the experience zone point 15 is perfect.
9. There was still a Shouxing discount, but the guests who came to deal with the housekeeper should forget that it should be a cake that should be a cake
Overall is quite satisfied with a good experience business, good time, and only when I can only leave, I can only leave
(*) To visit the project for yourself"
"餐點好吃～氣氛也很棒～
重點是！今天我們自己做了蛋糕帶去
裡面沒有蠟燭也沒有餐具
結果他們幫我們上的時候全部都有附上！！！
超級貼心～～～😻😻😻","The meal is delicious ~ The atmosphere is also great ~
The point is!Today we made the cake and took it
There are no candles or tableware inside
As a result, they all attached when they helped us!IntersectionIntersection
Super intimate ~~~"
"今天來的這家餐酒館真的是超級讚👍🏻
首先，光外面裝潢就很吸眼球了！
希臘式風格的餐酒館不多
一進到店內
滿滿的異國風情席卷而來！

接著餐點不論是義大利麵、前菜、燉飯都是在一定的水準之上！
我是對義大利麵非常挑剔的人
這一間是我吃到的第一名🥇

服務員態度更是讚👍🏻
不論點單、上菜、補水⋯⋯所有服務跟態度都很到位❗️

小小的建議是主餐內容可再多一些餐點選擇
完美❤️❤️❤️","This dining tavern I came today is really super praised 👍🏻
First of all, the outside of the light is very eye -catching!
There are not many Greek -style dining taverns
As soon as you enter the store
The full exotic style swept!

Then the meal, whether it is pasta, front dishes, and stewed rice at a certain level!
I am a very picky person on the past
This is the first place I have eaten 这

The attitude of the waiter is even more like 度
Regardless of ordering, serving, hydration, all services and attitudes are in place ❗️

The small suggestion is that the main meal content can choose more meals.
Perfect ❤️❤️️️️"
"氣氛、服務很棒！
烤伊比利豬很嫩很香
可惜提拉米蘇是海綿蛋糕、生火腿起司燉飯有點太鹹、old fashion太苦太嗆，小小可惜","The atmosphere and service are great!

位於雙連站巷弄，位置較隱密，近林森錢櫃
少數餐酒皆優的店家

酥炸蟹肉莎莎一份兩個，使用巨大的帝王蟹味棒裹漿酥炸，夾入莎莎醬與新鮮蟹肉絲並用魚子醬點綴，海鮮版基隆營養三明治，這道吃起來爽度爆表，我這不愛蟹肉棒的人給過！
再來炭烤海鮮沙拉佐檸檬白酒油醋滋味清爽，海鮮料有透抽、白蝦、白鯷魚搭上煙燻起司丁與堅果增加口感層次，生菜很新鮮爽脆，裡面還有檸檬醋醃漬的酸四季豆，推薦喜酸的人嚐嚐
而廣島煎食追以蚵仔煎做發想，厚厚的烘蛋包裹廣島牡蠣，蛋皮焦香，原味就很好吃再搭上主廚自製的甜椒海山醬又是另一種風味
主食類我個人很愛脆煎紅條石斑佐海膽風味麵
紅條石斑煎到外皮恰恰，調味簡單吃得到魚排鮮味，肉質緊實Q彈非常好吃(好想單點魚排....)
義大利麵是帶Q勁的口感，吃的時候已經放冷了但不會膩口
剝皮辣椒雞燉飯就比較重口了，滋味鹹香帶一點辣勁，帕達諾脆片口感加分
威靈頓半熟鮪魚排是店家創意菜，酥皮很香，鮪魚烤至五分熟，配菜也很多汁好吃

給大家看看我們點了什麼酒

Come to charcoal -grilled seafood salad lemon and white wine oil vinegar. The seafood material has soy sauce, white shrimp, white catfish with smoke Stein and nuts to increase the taste level, lettuce is fresh and crispy, there are lemon vinegar pickled inside Sour sour beans, recommended people who are sour to taste
And Hiroshima fried food is chased with Taipa fried, and the thick roasted egg wrapped in Hiroshima oysters, the egg skin is scorched, the original flavor is delicious and then put on the chef's homemade sweet pepper mountain sauce
Period food, I love crispy fried red strips, grouper, and signs of flavor
The red strip grouper is fried to the outer skin, and the seasoning is simple to get the fish steak, and the fastener of the flesh is very delicious (I really want to order fish steak ...)
The pasta is a taste of Q strength. When I eat it, I have been cold but not greasy
Peeling pepper chicken stewed rice is relatively heavy.
Wellington's half -cooked catfish row is a creative dish of the store. The meringue is very fragrant. The catfish is grilled until five cooked, and the side dishes are also delicious.

If you like refreshing, you can order Neptune and Bero ~ Berlite liquid clear aroma, Neptune is lighter to drink

"不滿意的點如下：

1
1月29日訂2月14日兩位，到場後被帶到10人座沙發矮桌區。
2
牛排上有綁繩子（照片為拆前及拆後各一張），味道是我喜歡的，但是非常難切。
3
菜口喊餐及碗盤撞擊聲嘈雜。
4
結帳時並未扣除訂金，事後去電反應才回覆會再刷退訂金。
5
當日有去電告知有壽星，詢問是否可自費準備生日甜點，店員回覆會招待一份提拉米蘇上面會插蠟燭，結果照片中的甜點是原本的情人節套餐中的甜點三選二，並沒有特別另外一份，也沒有蠟燭。","The dissatisfaction is as follows:

1
On January 29, two were scheduled to be on February 14th. After arriving, they were taken to the 10 -seater sofa dwarf area.
2
There is a rope on the steak (the photo is one before and after the disassembly). The taste is what I like, but it is very difficult to cut.
3
The dishes are shouting meals and dishes.
4
The deposit was not deducted at the checkout. After the power reaction was replaced, the deposit was returned.
5
On the same day, there was a telegram to inform you of Shouxing and asked if he could prepare birthday dessert at your own expense. The clerk would entertain a candle on the Tiramisu. As a result, the dessert in the photo was the three desserts in the original Valentine's Day set. There is no special one or a candle."
"份量十分精緻，口味特別還不錯👍
這難道就是地中海的味道嗎😳

Menu提供蠻多支酒可以搭餐，有機會的話會想再體驗看看！這次五個人來用餐，餐廳直接提供包廂給我們，服務人員服務態度也都很好，餐廳氣氛也浪漫浪漫的，是個美好的用餐體驗🙌","The portion is very delicate, the taste is particularly good 👍
Is this the taste of the Mediterranean?

"地中海型的bar蠻酷的，有很大的座位區可以一群人來慶生，晚上九點過後店家會把燈光調暗徹底的變成bar😂，會看不見我們吃的東西是什麼😁🤣🤣

一坐下店家會先送上開胃湯品，其實就是一杯柴魚高湯～

餐點的話建議沙拉可以不用點（吃起來還好），其他的味道都不錯喔👌","The Mediterranean -type BAR is quite cool. There are a large seat area to celebrate a group of people. After 9 o'clock in the evening, the shops will darkly turn the lights into BAR😂.

As soon as you sit down the store, you will send the appetizer first, but it is actually a cup of firewood soup ~

If you have a meal, it is recommended that salads do not need to be ordered (good to eat), the other taste is good 👌"

"榮登我現在心目中第一的口袋名單
服務人員都很親切、環境氣氛很好、交通也很方便、價格也不貴，最重要的是餐點非常好吃

本次是幫朋友慶生，還很貼心給了提拉米蘇，難得愛吃日料的友人都讚不絕口

不小心點多了，服務人員還會建議說有點太多，好貼心

"（個人想法，僅供參考）服務很好，氣氛不錯，但⋯如果目的是吃美食，建議慎重考慮⋯因為性價比極、極、極低⋯
炸菇🍄-麵粉:菇類=3:1覺得應該叫做炸麵粉⋯
披薩🍕-上面的食材很少，很像速食，披薩皮還有種佛卡夏的感覺
我最喜歡的是 烤蔬菜🥬（但仍覺得太油）😅","(Personal ideas, for reference only) The service is very good and the atmosphere is good, but if the purpose is to eat food, it is recommended to consider it carefully because of the extremely cost -effective, extremely low, extremely low ...
Fried mushrooms-flour: mushroom = 3: 1 think it should be called fried flour ...
Pizza 上-there are very few ingredients above, very much like fast food, pizza also feels like a Fokasha
My favorite is roasted vegetables (but still feel too oily) 😅"
"環境很舒服、音樂很好聽、座位也夠寬敞，氣氛很適合約會！

餐前招待的柴魚湯、牛肉沙拉都很不錯，蚵仔蛋煎沒什麼味道、麵包小乾但香氣夠，義大利麵和燉飯都是偏硬的口感我比較不習慣，有機會想再來吃吃看其他前菜，沒喝酒的話一人700左右","The environment is very comfortable, the music is very nice, the seat is also spacious, and the atmosphere is very suitable for dating!

The firewood soup and beef salad entertained before meals are very good. There is no taste of fried eggs, the bread is small but the aroma is enough. Look at other previous dishes, if you do n’t drink, one person is about 700"
"令人極度驚艷的地方，其實叫他餐酒館有點辜負他的酒和餐， 兩者不論是叫酒吧或是叫餐廳都撐得起這個名號。
餐讓人意外的好吃，在你覺得大概是這個水準的情況下，來個水準之上
酒更不用說了，被第一杯芭樂調酒勾上後，就一步一步往客制調酒的路上去了。被我說在香港喝過很棒earl grey martine調酒，被激到不行的調酒師一連拿出各式茶酒基底，我只能說開眼界，立馬成為我酒吧愛店！！

今晚從house wine喝到客制調酒，原酒，基酒⋯不敢說杯杯都滿意，但杯杯都開心，一定會再去二訪三訪～","The extremely stunning place is actually that the meal and tavern is a bit disappointed with his wine and meals. Both can support the name whether they are called bars or restaurants.
The meal is unexpectedly delicious, and if you think it is probably this level, you can get a level.
Not to mention the wine, after being hooked by the first cup of Barrine bartender, just step by step towards the way to make bartender.I said that I had drank a great Earl Grey Martine in Hong Kong, and the bartender who was stimulated to take out various kinds of tea and wine bases in a row. I can only say that I have an eye -opening and immediately become my bar in my bar!Intersection

當天是為了慶祝女友生日而去用餐，餐點中規中矩，出餐速度適中，服務員都蠻熱心的，晚上有駐唱歌手的表演，原本希望可以浪漫的聽個歌，可是現場的環境比熱炒店還吵雜，客人大聲講話伴隨歌手的歌聲，讓我用餐完就想儘速離席，是間不適合浪漫約會的餐廳，但如果想大聲跟朋友聊天喝點酒，或許也可考慮看看。,"On the same day, I dine to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. The meal was quite satisfactory. The meal was moderate. The waiters were very enthusiastic. At night, there was a singer's performance. Originally, I wanted to listen to a song romantically. It was also noisy. The guests spoke loudly with the singer's singing. I wanted to leave the seat as soon as possible after eating. It was a restaurant that was not suitable for romantic dating. However, if you want to chat with friends loudly, you may also consider it."
餐點跟裝潢非常用心，地中海的風格，餐點也很精緻美味，每一道餐點都很有異國風味，座位也是非常寬敞舒適，餐廳氛圍也非常放鬆，還可以小酌怡情，很適合三五好友一同分享，服務員也都很有耐心跟親切，真的要好好推一波👍,"The meal and decoration are very attentive. The style of the Mediterranean and the meal is also very delicate and delicious. Each meal is very exotic, the seats are also very spacious and comfortable. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very relaxed. Five friends share together, the waiters are very patient and kind, really need to push a wave of waves."
"餐點好吃，肉醬義大利麵的口味帶有點酸感（番茄的？），加上肉丁的肉脂香，非常好吃。
肉丁也有一定的大小，多了一種口感。
現場表演聲音太大，若是坐在面對面的座位，講起話來很痛苦，除了這點外，氣氛也是好的，吃約會聚餐的好選擇。","The meal is delicious, and the taste of the meat sauce is a bit sore (tomato?), Plus the meat fat fragrance of meat, very delicious.
There is also a certain size of the meat, which has one more taste.
The sound of the live performance is too loud. If you sit on the face of face, it is painful to talk about it. In addition to this, the atmosphere is also good."
"餐廳在小巷裡，下計程車後稍微找了一下，還好不難找；
餐廳氣氛很好，迎賓的一口柴魚湯很棒、還能續；
菜式跳脫傳統、部分加上台式的創意，喜不喜歡見仁見智，個人最喜歡的是熱前菜莎莎醬酥炸蟹腿、軟殼蟹鹹蛋黃義大利麵，紹興酒橄欖油蝦的醬汁沾麵包也好吃，特別推薦的藍眼淚白酒有點驚艷，不喝酒的人也可以喝；
肋眼牛排油花不夠、比較像菲力，倒是配菜裡的烤蔬菜跟酸豆好吃！
甜點裡的肉桂捲應該是可以跳過去！
服務我們的男服務生很親切很專業！謝謝！
有機會還會再去","The restaurant is in the alley. After getting off the taxi, I found it a little bit, but it is not difficult to find;
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good, the welcoming the firewood soup is great and can be continued;
The dishes are away from tradition and some desktop creative ideas. I don't like to see the wisdom. Personally my favorite is the hot front dish Sasha sauce fried crab legs, soft shell crab salted egg yolk span noodles, Shaoxing wine olive oil shrimp sauce dipped in bread It's delicious, the specially recommended blue tears and liquor are a bit amazing, people who don't drink can also drink;
The rib eye steak oil is not enough, and it looks like Feili, but the grilled vegetables and sour beans in the side dishes are delicious!
The cinnamon roll in the dessert should be able to jump over!
Serving our male waiter is very kind and professional!Thanks!
I will go again if I have a chance"
地中海風格的餐酒館，可用googlemap線上訂位，裝潢佈置好拍，座位空間舒適，比較昏暗，調酒品項多，服務人員會一一說明，點了草莓...店員還主動送1手shot，結果多叫好幾手shot🤣,"The Mediterranean -style dining tavern, you can use GoogleMap to order online, decorate the decoration, the seat space is comfortable, dark, and many bartending items. The service staff will explain one by one. SHOT, the result is more called a few hands shoth"
"Leone Restaurant & Bar位於林森巷弄，內部空間卻十分寬敞，可以辦Party的那種寬敞，餐點也是沒話說的好吃😍

🔸炭烤海鮮沙拉佐檸檬白酒油醋$480
🔸酥炸蟹肉莎莎(2pcs)$340
🔸慢燉奶油溫體雞腿$360

炭烤海鮮沙拉裡面有透抽、白蝦、白鯷魚、煙燻起司，海鮮水準不錯，但我特別喜歡切成丁狀的煙燻起司，淡淡的煙燻香氣與濃郁的奶香是款大眾接受度很高的起司，有點想買回家當零嘴吃🤣沙拉調味偏酸，很適合搭配接下來的肉類～

前菜選擇蠻多，大家一定要點這道酥炸蟹肉莎莎，是主廚以營養三明治做為發想，將帝王蟹肉棒、蟹肉絲、莎莎醬夾入炸得酥脆的麵包裡，做出這道歐陸創意料理，每次去基隆廟口夜市都要吃營養三明治的我覺得我以後可以改吃這個！

🔸美國Prime老饕牛排(5oz)$1480
🔸濃魚湯海鮮鹹蛋黃麵$490

Leone的老饕牛排算是我吃過數一數二好吃的老饕牛排，處理地熟度十分剛好，簡單搭配海鹽就非常美味！而濃魚湯海鮮鹹蛋黃麵除了上頭吸睛的大軟殼蟹外，還使用了魚骨熬製的高湯烹煮麵條，完美混合了鹹蛋黃和海鮮風味😋

🔸大吉大荔$400
🔸海王星$400

雖說Leone偏向以餐點為主的餐酒館，但酒有厲害！尤其是這杯海王星，以琴酒為基酒，加入茉莉花、柴魚、蜂蜜、小黃瓜，你是不是在想這組合是不是什麼地獄料理？NONONO～柴魚和蜂蜜搭一起反而有股龍眼風味，喝起來味道清爽又和諧，不管是佐餐，還是專程來喝酒買醉，都很推薦點上這杯海王星🤗","Leone RESTAURANT & Bar is located in Linsen alleys, but the internal space is very spacious. You can handle the spacious party of the party.

The charcoal -grilled seafood salad includes soy sauce, white shrimp, white catfish, and smoky cheese. The seafood level is good, but I especially like to cut into dito -shaped smoke cheese. The cheese with a high degree of acceptance, I want to buy it home as a snack, eat salad and taste acid, which is very suitable for the next meat ~

There are quite a lot of previous dishes. Everyone must order this crispy fried crab meat Sasa. It is the chef to use the nutrition sandwiches as an idea to sandwich the king crab meat stick, crab meat, and Sasha sauce into the crispy bread and make this. Daocou Creative cuisine, every time I go to Keelung Miaokou Night Market, I have to eat nutritional sandwiches. I think I can change this in the future!

老 PRIME old steak (5OZ) $ 1480

Leone's old cattle steak is one of the best old steaks that I have eaten. The processing of the land is very delicious.

Although Leone is biased towards a meal -based restaurant, the wine is great!Especially this cup of Neptune, with piano wine as a base wine, add jasmine, firewood, honey, cucumber, do you wonder if this combination is a hell dish?NONONO ~ Chai Fish and honey have a long -eyed flavor, which tastes refreshing and harmonious. Whether it is a meal or a special trip to drink and buy drunk, I recommend ordering this cup of Neptune 🤗"
第一次到Leone用餐為了幫男朋友慶生🎉，整體的氛圍非常好，每一道餐點都有用心的感覺，尤其是威靈頓鮪魚真的很嫩很好吃😋，每一位服務生也都很親切，生日還有送小蛋糕唷🥳🥳,"For the first time, I went to Leone for a meal in order to help her boyfriend celebrate the birthday. The overall atmosphere is very good. Each meal has a feeling of intention, especially the Welleneon catfish is really tender and delicious. They are also very kind, there are also small cakes for birthday 🥳🥳 🥳🥳 🥳🥳 🥳🥳 🥳🥳 🥳🥳"
"店內氣氛很好且餐點都很不錯
不過坐的位子太裡面比較容易被忽略

調酒的部分順口 酒感適中
餐前的柴魚湯也好好喝
整體而言我蠻推的
很適合慶祝生日與好友聚會","The atmosphere in the store is very good and the meals are very good
But the seat is too easy to be ignored

The bartending part is moderate and the wine feels moderate
The firewood soup before the meal is also good

大推剝皮辣椒雞燉飯還有蒜辣透抽！！超級好吃～～而且每個服務生都很親切，服務棒棒餐點好吃店內環境漂亮！廁所乾淨貼心（漱口水及衛生棉都有提供！,"Push peeling pepper chicken stewed rice and garlic spicy soy sauce!IntersectionSuper delicious ~~ And each waiter is very kind, and the good environment for serving a dinner dinner is beautiful!The toilet is clean and thoughtful (mouthwash and sanitary napkin are provided!"
"餐點推薦剝皮辣椒雞燉飯跟披薩🍕，低銷500+1成服務費
餐廳的氛圍感很棒，適合多人聚會慶生，中間的座位區位子很大，服務人員態度親切，用餐期間要切換音樂風格還會特別提醒，","Meals recommend peeling pepper chicken stew and pizza, low sales of 500+1 % service fee
The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It is suitable for multi -person gatherings to celebrate birthday. The middle seat location is very large, the service staff attitude is cordial, and the music style should be switched during dining."
服務人員熱情招呼，餐盤會儘速更換，各式的餐點也非常好吃美味！酒飲也不錯，可以考慮列入名單中。,"The service staff greeted enthusiastically, the dinner plate will be replaced as soon as possible, and the various meals are also very delicious and delicious!Alcohol is also good, you can consider listing in the list."
"【優點】
1. 餐廳漂亮、調酒很浮誇，很適合網美拍美照打卡。
2. 包廂空間舒適，人多怎麼吵都無會影響到別人。
3. 服務生親切。

【缺點】
1. 海鮮極度不新鮮，淡菜有腥味、蛤蠣殼破、蝦子肉質粉粉的軟軟爛爛滿滿酒味，吃完後有人過敏、有人回家吐，雖然是主打地中海料理餐廳，但還是建議大家不要點海鮮為佳。
2. 上菜時間長，且不曉得是否因為在聖誕節過後去用餐，許多料理都沒有提供，服務生表示材料不足故無法供餐。
3. 餐點份量較少，兩人建議點3-4道才會吃飽。

【整體感想】
這次的用餐經驗因為前述優點給予兩顆星，當日服務生有告知說有打卡五星送干貝的活動，但吃過他們的海鮮義大利麵之後實在不敢再吃他們的海鮮。
蝦子是我本次吃到最驚嚇之食物，撥完殼之後只發現蝦肉有點粉粉的，感覺不是太新鮮，但放進嘴裡後直接吐掉!因為那隻蝦肉粉粉的之外還軟軟爛爛的!且充滿酒味!!原本告知服務生想取消海鮮拼盤，但因為已經做了就只好吃了。後來主廚有前來詢問餐點狀況，講述給他聽後他告訴我們幾個可能造成蝦子口感不佳的原因：蝦子品種不一樣、蝦子處理方式有先醃過再煎再烤，所以蝦子應該是沒問題的...。
但!外面一般平價的海鮮料理，蝦子也不可能會是這種口感的吧!且我也表示說清楚這並不是吃生猛海鮮的餐廳，沒有要求海鮮狀況要多麼新鮮多麼活跳，但是軟爛、過敏甚至吃不下去的狀況，正常人應該都無法接受。
主廚有表示說可以再做一份給我們，但真的是敬謝不敏。

最後餐廳有給一道招待餐點及打9折優惠，雖然餐廳對於我們的反饋有所表示，但還是要留下評價給大家參考。","【advantage】
1. The restaurant is beautiful and the bartending is very exaggerated.
2. The box space is comfortable, and how many people are noisy will affect others.
3. The waiter is kind.

【shortcoming】
1. Seafood is extremely fresh. The light vegetables have fishy smell, oyster shells, and the soft and rotten flavor of the meat quality of shrimp. But it is recommended not to order seafood.
2. The food time is long, and I do n’t know if many dishes are not provided because they have dinner after Christmas. The waiter said that the materials are insufficient.
3. The amount of meals is small, and the two are recommended to order 3-4 to eat.

【Overall feeling】
This dining experience was given two stars because of the aforementioned advantages. On the day, the waiter informed that there was a activity of punching five -stars to send shellfish, but after eating their seafood Italian noodles, I did not dare to eat their seafood anymore.
Shrimp is the most frightened food I ate this time. After the shell is dial, I only found that the shrimp is a bit pink. It feels not too fresh, but spit it out after putting it in my mouth! Soft and rotten! And full of wine !! I originally informed the waiter to cancel the seafood platter, but because you had already done it, you had to eat it.Later, the chef came to ask the meal situation. After telling him, he told us that several of them might cause the poor taste of shrimp: Shrimp varieties are different, and shrimp processing methods are marinated before fried before baking, so shrimp should be grilled, so shrimp should be roasted No problem ...
But! The general cheap seafood cuisine outside, and the shrimp can not be this taste! And I also said that this is not a restaurant that is not eating raw seafood. , Allergic or even unable to eat, normal people should not be accepted.
The chef said that he could make another one for us, but he really thanked him.

In the end, the restaurant gave a tenth and 10 % discount. Although the restaurant has expressed some feedback on our feedback, it is still necessary to leave an evaluation for your reference."
餐廳氣氛非常好，燈光幽暗、座位寬敞，深墨綠色的沙發U形卡座非常舒適，餐點美味，大推起司盤配酒，肋眼牛排很嫩很美味，調酒也很好喝。店內安靜，很適合情侶、或下班後小聚小酌。,"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good, the lights are dark, the seats are spacious, and the dark green sofa U -shaped card seats are very comfortable. The meal is delicious. The rib eye steak is tender and delicious, and the bartender is also delicious.The store is quiet, which is very suitable for couples, or a small gathering after get off work."
餐點好吃，服務人員親切,The meal is delicious and the service staff is kind
"一開始被高達4.7分的好評吸引
實際到訪後覺得有些過譽整體大概3.7分
氣氛佳、服務好、環境舒適適合約會
然餐點部分有些失望…
1. 松阪豬燉飯：松阪豬部分完全咬不動很硬 調味上也有濃厚豆鼓味 口味因人而異就不多說
2.紅膽石斑義大利麵：香茅味濃厚 蓋過了海膽醬的味道 煎石斑魚部分不錯

整體來說海鮮部分表現不錯，但口味及餐點品質認為沒有達到這個價格應有的水準。","At first, it was attracted by praise from up to 4.7 points
After the actual visit, I feel that there is some overall reputation. The overall is about 3.7 points
Good atmosphere, good service, comfortable environment, suitable contract
But the meal part is a bit disappointed ...
1. Matsusaka pig stewed rice: Matsusaka pigs can not be bite at all.
2. Red gallbladder grouper.

Overall, the seafood part is good, but the taste and quality of the meal are considered that it does not reach the level of this price."

"因為是看Google評論 發現這間餐酒館有4.8的高分 而且評論人數不少，所以以為來這邊會有驚喜。

裝潢的部分很單調 有點簡陋 廁所旁的兩個圓桌的燈光不是很好，空間算大。

餐點的部分那天很幸運，點到的可能都剛好我們都不懂的欣賞，餐點份量很少味道很普通 吃不出來特色，沒有記憶點…酒水除了貝殼裡的奇奇稍微還算不錯（份量很少）

總而言之，我感覺不出這間餐酒館是從那個方面得到4.8的高分
不論環境，地理位置 裝潢氣氛，服務，餐點品質 都感覺不到這樣的價值.. 餐點的價格應該有到….

平時吃到覺得不理想的餐點，都會摸摸鼻子算了，
貴店真的讓我忍不住花了一兩個小時來寫評論！

不推薦 不會回訪 會提醒友人避開","Because I saw Google's comment and found that the dining tavern had a high score of 4.8 and a lot of comments, I thought there would be surprises here.

The decoration part is very monotonous and the two round tables next to the toilet are not very good, and the space is large.

The meal part was very lucky that day. The may be appreciated by the order. The amount is very small)

All in all, I can't feel that this dining tavern gets a high score of 4.8 from that aspect.
Regardless of the environment, the geographical decoration atmosphere, service, and quality of meals do not feel the value .. The price of meals should be there ...

When you usually eat the unsatisfactory meal, you will touch your nose.
Your shop really makes me can't help but take an hour or two to write comments!

If you don’t recommend it, you will remind your friends to avoid it"
"兩人吃了$2,400
整體而言CP值偏低，東西不錯，但份量少價格也不低。調酒部分滿喜歡的。服務態度不錯。
🚩蝦湯燉飯：還不錯，蝦味鮮
🚩鴨胸義大利麵：偏油、酸酸的，口味偏台式
🚩炸松露薯條：松露被藏在薯條下面，吃到一半才發現，但搭起來還不錯
🚩炸鱈魚條：這個好吃，一份6根一下就沒了
🚩調酒 Childhood：很讚的調酒，酒感輕、口感綿密類似奶昔；肉桂/薄荷/果乾3種裝飾，在喝的時候會一併把他們的香味吸進去
🚩調酒 Citrus boost：不錯的調酒，但杯子裝飾偏浮誇。覺得酒感沒有菜單上寫的那麼輕，蘭姆酒味滿突出的。仍然是杯好喝的調酒，但不喜酒感的話建議先避開。

小建議：
➡️店內菜單是用google drive 看pdf檔，但是網路收訊差。建議應該介紹有wifi可連，且燈光昏暗，密碼很難看清楚。","The two ate $ 2,400
On the whole, the CP value is low, and things are good, but the price is not low.The bartending part is full of likes.The service attitude is good.
饭 Shrimp soup stew: pretty good, shrimp flavor
利 Duck breasts Italian noodles: partial oil, sour, taste partially desktop
： Fried Loan potato strip: Truly truffles are hidden under the fries, half of them discovered, but it is not bad to set up
这个 Fried cod fish stripe: This is delicious, one 6 is gone
D Childhood: A great bartending, light wine, dense taste similar to milkshakes; cinnamon/mint/dried fruit, will suck their fragrance together when drinking
U Citrus Boost: Good bartending, but cup decoration is exaggerated.I feel that the wine is not as light as written on the menu, and Rim has a high taste.It is still a cup of delicious bartending, but if you do n’t like alcohol, it is recommended to avoid it first.

Suggestions:
用 ️ The menu in the store is to see the PDF file with Google Drive, but the online receipt is poor.It is recommended that WiFi can be connected, and the lights are dim, and the password is difficult to see clearly."
"2022.10.28

唯獨室內裝潢，總讓我聯想到以前的西餐廳XD","2022.10.28

Only interior decoration reminds me of the previous Western restaurant XD"
"對於不能出國的現在，聚餐也要有微出國的儀式感 (/ω＼)

店內沙發座位頗舒適，晚上九點後，會將燈光調暗進入酒吧的營業模式，音樂會從輕鬆的風格，轉換成 Pop music，挺放鬆喜歡的

餐點部分我們直接請店員推薦，三個人點這樣，有點吃太飽 (/ω＼)
🥄Leone特色雞塊
外皮炸得酥脆，搭配些清爽生菜一起享用，是很開胃的一道炸物，較重口味，適合搭配酒精
🥄剝皮辣椒水牛城辣雞翅
辣雞翅表皮顏色炸的比較深，再佐以剝皮辣椒，及主廚特調辣醬汁，吃起來不會過於油膩，口感有點乾乾硬硬的，剝皮辣椒頗嗆口讓我辣到流淚 ಥ_ಥ
🥄麻辣鴨賞鹽蔥義大利麵
這道我超喜歡！鴨賞的口感軟Q軟Q，麵條帶嚼勁不軟爛，佐以花椒調味，又辣又香，舌尖麻麻辣辣的不會辣到很不舒服，非常過癮
🥄牛肝菌松露奶香野菇燉飯
這道也是那天我覺得超好吃的！先把半熟蛋攪和進燉飯裡，混合著蛋香一起吃，香氣四溢的奶油味，混合著野菌菇及松露迷人的氣味，一股香氣直衝鼻腔，會忍不住一口接一口，推推
🥄歐式小捲米粉棺材板
鬆軟的歐包香氣十足，夾著口感酥脆的米粉，加上QQ軟軟的小卷，混合著法式白醬和起士的香氣，大口咬下，讓人超有滿足感的，我也頗喜歡～

這裡的一大特色就是有超美的浮誇係調酒！酒單有兩個版本，一份為經典調酒，另一份是由希臘地名對應一杯調酒的名字
🥃阿克羅提，義式咖啡的香氣帶著酒味，剛入口時喉間瞬間充滿威士忌香氣，還有點卡魯哇奶酒甜膩的香氣
🥃尼雅卡梅尼，第一口也是濃濃的酒味，接著奶油糖香香甜甜的滋味會慢慢散發出來，朋友平常不太喝酒，他覺得慢慢喝可以接受，有點像奶酒
🥃阿瑞斯之淚，就是Tequila強烈的味道，喜歡的人會很喜歡耶

一個頗適合聚會的地方，餐點好吃，調酒夠華麗","For now that you can't go abroad, you must also have a sense of rituals that are out of the country (/ω＼)

The sofa seats in the store are quite comfortable. After nine o'clock in the evening, the lighting of the light will be darkened into the bar's business model. The concert will be converted from a relaxed style to POP MUSIC.

Let's ask the clerk to recommend it directly.

European -style small roll rice noodle coffin board
The soft European bag is full of aroma, with crispy rice noodles, plus the soft rolls of QQ, mixed with the aroma of French white sauce and cheese. ~

One of the major features here is that there are super beautiful exaggeration!There are two versions of the wine list.
义 Akrorti, the aroma of Italian coffee has a wine flavor. When the mouth was just in the mouth, the throat was full of whiskey aroma, and a bit of the sweet aroma of Karuwa milk
， Niya Cameni, the first bite is also a strong flavor of wine, and then the sweet and sweet taste of cream sugar will slowly emit out. Friends usually do n’t drink too much. He feels that you can accept it slowly.
， Ares' tears are the strong taste of Tequila, and those who like it will like it very much

A place that is quite suitable for the party, the meal is delicious, and the alcohol is gorgeous enough"

"空間寬敞雅緻，地中海風格白淨舒適，迎賓的蒜頭雞湯容器就很浮誇，以為是調酒🤣

調酒的容器部分更是浮誇，尤其是貝殼那杯的沙灘好大盤😂然後用吸管喝的感覺很特別，但酒感不弱呦！另一杯有羊奶優格的非常棒，冰淇淋口感的優格加進酒裡也很合適～
牛排的部分不是很好咬但肉質確實不錯～整體很適合約會～ …","The space is spacious and elegant.

"今天陪兩位好吃鬼來這間餐酒館試試，看著開幕沒幾個禮拜卻有著100多5星評價，畢竟在咱們地頭上新開的店當然要來踢館......來好好品嚐一下，既然前陣子基金賺了不少今天預算無上限就盡量給他點：

開胃菜是裝著金樽琉璃杯的檸檬冰沙佐濃縮咖啡，很特別的開胃搭配，酸甜中帶點咖啡香及大人的微苦味。
主菜一開場就直接來盤Prime舒肥烤牛排，跟五星主廚快餐車裡的烤牛肉一樣讚，但畢竟稍微烤過使得舒肥的口感比較不明顯，事前鹽漬的部分倒是調味的很完美；燉牛肉及水潤餅的搭配也是一絕，尤其是水潤餅的味道還真沒在台灣吃過；萬巒豬腳也是完完全全的軟嫩膠原蛋白集合體，搭配階梯式不同種類的酸菜去油膩感，跟之前口袋名單的私廚法式料理有拼。
海鮮燉飯及鴨胸米香飯也是風味十足，完全不輸其他餐廳，尤其是舒肥鴨胸的軟嫩十足令人印象深刻。
調酒部分點了杯「劈哩卡劈哩拉拉 波波莉娜貝貝魯多」兒童台魔法DoReMe的變身台詞，基本上就是杯深水炸彈的奶油啤酒，送上來前還會點上愛心型仙女棒，算是有符合主題，濃厚的奶油啤酒配上厚酒的味道真是濃郁滑順酒精高的衝突感；另外一杯「昨日桂花香 今昔醉八方」倒是偏順口的伏特加水果酒，一杯400大洋果然酒味十足，若是酒味淡一點可能會更好入口，這適合喝厚酒的朋友品嚐。

這間算是近半年內覺得值得寫五星的餐酒館，這樣一餐下來三個人吃也要4000大洋，但重點是我被邀請來吃之前才去大埔鐵板燒大吃特吃而已，飽的要命⋯⋯⋯不過這間居然讓我開胃到吃了一大堆，這大廚手藝真的不錯。","Today, I will accompany the two delicious ghosts to this dining tavern. Watching the opening a few weeks, there are more than 100 5 -star evaluation. After all, the new store on our ground is of course to play ... Come and taste it. Since the fund earlier has made a lot of infinite budget today, I try to give him as much as possible:

The appetizer is a lemon smoothie concentrated coffee containing the golden bottle glazed glazed cup. It is very special appetizer. The sweet and sour taste is a little bit of coffee and the slight bitterness of adults.
As soon as the main cuisine opened, PRIME Shu Fei grilled steak was directly like the grilled beef in the five -star chef fast dining car, but after all, a little baked made the taste of Shu fat more obvious. Perfect; the combination of beef stew and moisturizing cakes is also a must, especially the taste of moisture cakes has not been eaten in Taiwan; Wanluan pig's feet are also completely soft tender collagen collection, with different types of staircases The sauerkraut is greasy, and it is fighting with the private kitchen French dishes of the previous pocket list.
Seafood stewed rice and duck breasts are also full of flavor. They do not lose other restaurants at all, especially the softness of Shu Fei Duck breasts.
The section of the bartender ordered a cup of ""splitting card and split La La Popolina Beludu"" Children's Magic Doreme's transformation line, which is basically a cup of cream beer with deep water bombs. The type of fairy stick is considered to be in line with the theme. The strong cream beer with thick wine is really strong and smooth. Sure enough, the wine taste is full. If it is a little lighter, it may be better imported. This is suitable for friends who drink thick wine to taste.

This is a dining tavern that feels worthwhile in the past six months. In this way, the three people eat 4,000 oceans after a meal, but the point is that I was invited to eat it before I went to the Dapu Tefaki. The terrible time, but this was so appetizing to eat a lot, this big chef is really good."
"服務：態度非常好也很親切、菜單上面的介紹也可以給滿分、外場人員對餐點都很了解，細心推薦。

環境：氣氛很好、有植物與掛畫襯托出店內精緻的空間感，吧台的設計也很喜歡。

餐點：食物個人淺見認為稍微普通，出餐速度需要加快，因等了35分鐘餐點才全部到齊～食材上面，覺得飯麵的美味程度～好過於主食的鴨肉跟海鮮，且飯麵很熱但上面的擺的蔬食卻冷冷的有點可惜了！
整體而言若是這個價位的餐點在台北市不算非常貴，不過感覺餐點的品質可以再做提升👍","服務：態度非常好也很親切、菜單上面的介紹也可以給滿分、外場人員對餐點都很了解，細心推薦。

不過價格稍高","The atmosphere is good and the meals are good and wine is good
But the price is slightly higher"
"服務非常好👍
非常適合聚餐或是想要單獨空間，不太會受打擾，可以自在的用餐。
今天兩個人點3道菜也非常足夠，聽說義大利麵也很好吃，會二度再訪","The service is very good
It is very suitable for dinner or wanting separate space. It is not disturbed, and you can dine freely.
Today, two people order 3 dishes is also very sufficient. I heard that the Italian noodles are also delicious."
"很喜歡野菇盅，配上麵包很搭口❤️
但前菜和沙拉還沒吃完
主食立刻上桌，有點太快，吃完前菜主食都冷了😭😭😭
絲絨馬鈴薯奶味太重，比較不合我的口味
烤布丁底部的莓果酸甜，但我也較喜歡甜多於酸的甜點

純屬個人口感喜好分享","I like the mushroom cup very much, with the bread, it is very mouthful ❤️
But the former vegetables and salad haven't finished eating it yet
The staple food was immediately served, it was a bit too fast, the main food before eating was cold.
The flavor of velvet potato milk is too heavy, and it is less like my taste
The berry fruit at the bottom of the baked pudding is sweet and sour, but I also prefer the sweet desserts that are more sweet than acid

It is purely a sense of population."
"前陣子看到朋友分享 覺得酒很漂亮
剛好朋友生日決定一起來用餐
招待的蜂蜜檸檬奇亞籽很好喝也很漂亮
前菜點了海鮮烘蛋 一上桌超級香～
海鮮很新鮮配上烘蛋好好吃
海鮮紅醬義大利麵一直被朋友稱讚
不會死鹹 一口接一口
中間也有一位服務生很熱情的過來幫我們介紹飲料
我覺得很棒的是可以客製自己喜歡的種類
當天其實有一款酒已經賣完了
但是服務生還是想辦法換不同的基酒調給我們 很棒❤️
中間因為還餓所以想再加點東西
他們也會用心的幫我們介紹跟搭配 覺得服務真的很好
還有一點我真的要說
蒜油松露薯條真的好～好～吃！
鹹度剛好搭配松露真的💯
外面很酥脆但是裡面居然是鬆軟的 超愛這口感（因為太好吃了根本來不及拍照哈哈
店內空間算大 桌子的距離也不會太近蠻舒服的

會少一顆星的原因真的就是價錢太高了⋯😅
酒真的都很漂亮 但是$350-400
真的有點小貴 沒辦法點很多輪 哈哈
如果價錢能再可愛一點應該會每週報到一次😘","I saw a friend sharing a while ago, I think the wine is very beautiful
Just a friend ’s birthday decision to dine together
The honey lemon Qia seeds entertaining are delicious and beautiful
Once the food ordered the seafood eggs, it was super fragrant ~
The seafood is very fresh with a baked egg and delicious
Seafood red sauce Italian noodles have always been praised by friends
Will not die and sip a bite
There was also a waiter who came here to help us introduce drinks
I think it's great to customize the types I like
In fact, there was actually a wine that was sold that day
But the waiter still finds a way to change different base wines to give us great ❤️
Because I am still hungry, I want to add something
They will also help us introduce and match with each other, feel that the service is really good
One more thing I really want to say
Garlic oil truffle potato strip is really good ~ good ~ eat!
The saltiness is exactly with the truffle of truffle
The outside is very crispy, but the inside is actually soft and super loves this taste (because it's too delicious, it's too late to take pictures haha
The distance of the large table in the store is not too close to the distance.

The reason why there will be one less star is really the price is too high.
The wine is really beautiful, but $ 350-400
It's really a little expensive, there is no way to order many rounds haha ​​haha
If the price can be cute, you should report it once a week 😘"
"真的是浮誇系餐酒館，每一支調酒都很美，酒感也不錯。這間店的氛圍也很舒適，服務生也會主動推薦想喝的口味。

餐點也很棒，不過燉飯、義大利麵主餐份量沒有像介紹的預期多啦，松露燉飯的味道淡了些。最可惜的是原本期待的牛燒餅卻賣完了（聽說必點）。","It is really exaggerated dining tavern. Each bartender is beautiful and the wine feels good.The atmosphere of this shop is also very comfortable, and the waiters will actively recommend the taste they want to drink.

The meal is also great, but the main meal of stewed rice and pasta is not as expected to be introduced, and the taste of truffle stew is lighter.The most unfortunate is that the originally expected beef cakes have been sold (I heard that it must be ordered)."
"今天是幫朋友慶生定了此餐廳，餐廳還幫我們安排了單獨的包廂超級用心～
餐點跟調酒口味都很令人滿意！
看得出來餐點與調酒都有經過很用心的設計，是平常一般的酒吧很難看到的餐點！
除了餐點好吃以外，裡面內場的人員對於菜單也都能很快速的做推薦，今天推薦了限量的牛燒餅搭配班尼迪克蛋還有麻辣牛肚/牛筋，大推這道菜，超級好吃！
我們在這邊點了很多輪的酒，調酒設計很漂亮，適合拍照打卡，各種口味調酒都有特色，很推薦朋友聚會
最後是空間，空間寬敞完全不會有走動的壓力，座椅也十分舒適

整體來說是一家很用心的餐酒館！","Today is to help friends celebrate this restaurant. The restaurant also helped us arrange a separate box to be super intentional ~
The meals and bartending taste are very satisfactory!
It can be seen that the meal and bartending have been designed with great intentions. It is a meal that is difficult to see in the usual bar!
In addition to the delicious meals, the staff inside the field can also make recommendations quickly for the menu. Today, I recommend limited beef biscuits with Bannedik egg and spicy beef belly/beef tendon. Super delicious!
We ordered many wheels of wine here. The bartending design is very beautiful. It is suitable for taking pictures and punching cards. Various flavors are unique. I recommend friends gathering
Finally, there is space, the space is spacious and there is no pressure to move, and the seats are very comfortable.

Overall is a very careful dining tavern!"
"11/4星期三晚上與姊妹們聚
意外包場！！
聽說25號到次月5號是淡季，
想要享受寧靜可以趁這段時間😂
這家店老闆據說才27歲
但不論菜色、調酒、裝潢、服務等等
真的是一個大👍

當天我們3人很餓～
點了2道主食1個小 1個蔬食，竟然吃不飽！
（真心覺得多人吃 大概就是2人份吧😂）
九點又加點炸雞🍠薯條😂

九點過後
外場經理請喝調酒，一路陪聊天到10:30
（以後要五晚上或週末再來才能繼續聊哈哈哈）
覺得比「雅典」還好喝😂
服務生和我說雅典不濃 但我怎覺得濃哈哈哈
反倒是後來請喝葡萄柚&橙類調酒真順口

這家店，點調酒還送一杯調酒兌換券
生日也會送酒... 真心覺得太多囉！（我以為會有蛋糕之類的）

整體而言，是一間隱藏在小巷弄內
菜點好氣氛好&網美酒，真心推薦，值得再訪的店！","11/4 Wednesday night to gather with sisters
Unexpectedly!Intersection
I heard that the 25th to the 5th is the off -season.
If you want to enjoy tranquility, you can take advantage of this period
This shop owner is said to be only 27 years old
But regardless of dishes, bartending, decoration, service, etc.
It's really a big 个

The three of us were hungry that day ~
I ordered 2 main food and 1 small and 1 vegetable, so I ca n’t eat it!
(I really think that many people eat it about 2 people 😂)
Add some fried chicken 🍠 😂 😂 😂

After nine o'clock
Outside manager, please drink alcohol and chat all the way to 10:30
(Five nights or weekends in the future can continue to talk about hahaha)
I feel better than ""Athens"" 觉得
The waiter told me that Athens is not strong, but how can I feel strong hahaha
On the contrary, please drink grapefruit & orange bartender really smoothly

In this shop, you can also get a cup of bartending voucher
Birthday will also give wine ... I really feel too much!(I think there will be cakes and the like)

Overall, it is hidden in the alley
The dishes are good atmosphere & net wine, really recommended, it is worth visiting!"
整體的氣氛很棒 且服務人員很親切 平均價位要看是否有餐酒需求 可能因為去的時間是平日 所以在人數未到齊時店員有讓人先入座且無用餐時間的限制 這點很棒～～❤️❤️,"The overall atmosphere is great and the service staff is very affectionate. The average price depends on whether there is a meal wine demand. Because the time is going on, it is great when the number of people is not available when the number is not available. This is great. ~ ❤ case"
剛進入餐廳有點像招待會館，燈光偏暗氣氛佳，餐點很創新，味道都很好👍🏻,剛進入餐廳有點像招待會館，燈光偏暗氣氛佳，餐點很創新，味道都很好👍🏻
"意外發現住家附近的餐酒館，用餐當天因為是週日晚上所以人不多，店家正在佈置萬聖節🎃

花椒松露炸薯條：松露味比較重，不需要沾醬就很夠味，花椒味很淡也不用擔心咬破花椒的不適感，是個香氣很足的炸薯條。

水牛城炸雞：無骨、酸辣醬料，表皮不會爛爛且雞肉嫩而不柴，上面有花生粒點綴增加口感

干貝燉飯：份量不大，米粒部分是屬於燉飯該有的硬米心，干貝比較小但鮮味還不錯，搭配櫛瓜讓整個味道更好

調酒：都是直接跟調酒師討論後特調，一杯是百香果風味較為清爽，一杯是玫瑰🌹為主的調酒，蛋白打得還算濃密","I accidentally found the dining tavern near the home. Because there are not many people on Sunday night, the store is arranging Halloween.

Pepper truffle fried fries: The flavor of the truffle is relatively heavy. It is enough to taste without the need to dip the sauce. The pepper flavor is very light and don't worry about the discomfort of biting the peppercorns.

Buffalo fried chicken: boneless, hot and sour sauce, the skin will not rotten and the chicken is tender and not firewood.

Dry scallop stew: The portion is not large. The rice grains belong to the hard rice heart that should be stewed. The scallops are relatively small but the taste is not bad. It makes the whole taste better

Bart -up: After discussion with the bartender directly, a cup is more refreshing by the flavor of Passion fruit. One cup is a rose -based bartender."
"地中海餐酒館Leone Restaurant & Bar，一到門口映入眼簾的就是地中海風造景，餐廳內裝潢則以地中海風情的藍白色調為基準，注入一絲華麗感。

坐下來後還有迎賓飲料，非常美，最值得一提的是這裡的調酒都浮誇到不行，每一杯調酒還會附上一張boarding pass，很在小細節上用心的店家。

有氣球的這杯叫尼亞卡梅尼，以萊姆酒為基底加入蒂凡茶酒和奶油糖，喝起來很像奶酒。

另一杯以貝殼盛裝的叫卡馬利，以紅酒為基底，加入柯奇杜林苦艾酒及茉莉蜜茶泡泡。

餐點部分，每一道都好好吃!!完全沒有雷!
我們點了炙燒煙燻鮭魚沙拉$400、海鮮烘烤蛋$360、牛肝蕈奶香野菇燉飯$420、麻辣鴨賞義大利麵$420，其中我最喜歡麻辣鴨賞義大利麵，比較重口味一點，但卻很入味好吃~","The Mediterranean restaurant Leone Restaurant & Bar, as soon as it arrives at the door, is the Mediterranean style landscape, and the interior decoration of the restaurant is based on the blue and white tone of the Mediterranean style, injecting a gorgeous sense.

After sitting down, there is a welcome drink. It is very beautiful. The most worth mentioning is that the bartending here is exaggerated. Each cup of bartender will also be attached to a Boarding Pass, which is very careful in small details.

This cup with a balloon is Niakameni. It adds Liman tea and cream sugar based on Lym. It tastes like milk.

Another cup is called Kamali with a shell, with red wine as the base, and adds Cichdulin's bitter wine and jasmine tea for bubbles.

For the meal part, every one is delicious !! There is no thunder at all!
We ordered the burning smoked salmon salad $ 400, seafood roasted eggs $ 360, beef liver mushroom mushroom stewed rice stewed rice, spicy duck rewarding Italian noodles $ 420, of which I like the spicy duck to reward the Italian noodles, which is a bit heavy. But it is delicious ~"

"鱈魚條+蚵仔烘蛋+牛肝菌松露野菇燉飯+蘋果派+紅白酒。
位子寬敞，環境乾淨，但光線非常昏暗，有些桌子有放燈，我們的剛好沒有，所以食物跟人看起來都暗摸摸🤔
鱈魚條熱熱吃很好吃，蚵仔烘蛋是當天的隱藏版料理，不過才吃第一口，卻發現沾醬有一根長長的頭髮，跟店員反應後，餐點被送回廚房，之後重做了一份給我們，但我想應該只是重撈一碟醬吧？後來看到廚房的員工好像也沒有戴帽子，所以有頭髮掉落到餐點，或許也不意外⋯但以這個價位，我不認為這是可以被接受的失誤。燉飯也很好吃，但份量真的很少，盤子非常淺⋯
吃完主餐後加點一個蘋果派，份量也是蠻小的，大概跟麥當勞的大小差不多，但內餡比較濕軟。
吃到最後才發現壽星可以贈送一杯紅白酒，因為原本就已經有點紅白酒，本想說能否直接折抵掉，但店員說兩種酒不同，只能選擇多贈一杯。","Cod strip+Taipa roasted eggs+beef liver bacteria truffle wild mushroom stew+apple pie+red white wine.
The seats are spacious, the environment is clean, but the light is very dim. Some tables have lights. We do n’t have it, so the food with people seems to be secretly touched 🤔
The cod stick is hot and delicious. Taipa baked eggs are the hidden version of the day, but only the first bite, but found that the dipping sauce has a long hair. After responding to the clerk, the meal was returned to the kitchen. After that, the meal was returned to the kitchen. I made a copy for us, but I think it should just make a plate of sauce?Later, I saw that the employees in the kitchen did not seem to wear a hat, so I fell to meals with my hair, maybe it was not surprising. But at this price, I don't think this is an acceptable mistake.The stewed rice is also very delicious, but the amount is really small, the plate is very shallow ...
After eating the main meal, add an apple school, and the portion is also quite small. It is about the same size as McDonald's, but the filling is relatively soft.
At the end of the food, I found that Shouxing could give a glass of red and white wine, because it was already a little red white wine, and I wanted to say whether it could be discounted directly, but the clerk said that the two wines were different and they could only choose to give one more glass."

"看到網路介紹來的 氣氛不錯  價格偏高 停售了一些東西 有點可惜 但整體感覺是相當不錯的
雖然是為了干貝評分 但如果沒有  我也是會給五星的","Seeing the atmosphere of the Internet is good, the price is high. Selling some things is a pity, but the overall feeling is quite good.
Although it is for the score for scallops, it will give five stars without me"
"臨時和朋友約吃飯，剛好誤打誤撞來到了這裡。

餐點個人覺得規劃的很好，份量不會太多、太撐。

1. 松露薯條和洋蔥圈酥脆不油膩
2. 青醬干貝燉飯很香，米飯是我喜歡的硬度，青醬也不會太Heavy
3. 大推雞胸肉，超級嫩，配上青蔥，爽口又健康
4. 餐前麵包Q彈，配上奶油和海鹽很搭

酒的話個人覺得酒單可以再豐富一些，然後精緻度也可以再往上提升。

買單的時候非常親切的詢問餐點、調酒是否滿意，後來才知道原來是老闆啊XD，可見店家很重視客人的用餐體驗。

店內氣氛很好，絕對是可以二訪的地方。","I had an appointment with my friends for dinner, and I just accidentally hit it here.

The meal personally feels that the plan is very good, and the portion will not be too much.

1. Flash potato strips and onion rings are crispy and non -greasy
2. Green sauce stewed rice is very fragrant, rice is my favorite hardness, and green sauce will not be too heavy
3. Push chicken breast meat, super tender, with shallots, refreshing and healthy
4. The bread of the bread in front of the meal, with cream and sea salt very well

I personally think that the wine list can be richer, and then the exquisiteness can be improved upwards.

When I bought it, I asked me very kindly whether the meal was satisfactory or whether I was satisfied with the bartender. Later, I realized that it was the boss XD. It can be seen that the store attaches great importance to the guest's dining experience.

The atmosphere in the store is very good, and it is definitely a place to visit."
環境很舒服，菜單介紹很詳細，餐點超級有特色，服務人員對客人很貼心，還有啤酒比賽跟特別招待的shot杯，喜歡喝酒的超適合來聚會聊天的！,"The environment is very comfortable, the menu introduction is very detailed, the meal is super distinctive, the service staff is very intimate with the guests, and there are beer competitions with specially entertaining the SHOT Cup. The super suitable for drinking is suitable to meet and chat!"
氣氛讚，餐點味道還行，酒不錯!,"The atmosphere is praised, the meal is okay, the wine is good!"
餐點跟服務都很好 很推薦義大利麵跟戰斧牛排,Both meals and services are very good and recommended by Italian noodles and Tomahawk steaks

"其實有些時候做什麼工作看的細節都不太一樣，看得出團隊努力在維持溝通和氛圍，應該有一位主吧在管理吧台和外場，人很不錯，甜點烤比較慢，就先招待其它甜點，吧台的人員也是勤勞收紙巾加水，很感謝。
希望團隊和生意也都能越來越好。","In fact, sometimes the details of the work to do are not the same. You can see that the team is working hard to maintain communication and atmosphere. There should be a master bar on the management bar and outside. People are very good. The dessert is slow. The staff of the bar are also diligent in collecting paper towels and water. Thank you very much.
I hope the team and business will be better and better."
"年輕老闆的創意菜色真多，草封牛肉香甜嫩滑
空間寬敞，還有包廂","There are many creative dishes of the young boss, and the beef beef beef is sweet and tender and smooth

"裝潢很美，服務佳，餐點好吃
唯一可惜的是多人的大方桌不好坐又容易撞到腳","The decoration is beautiful, the service is good, the meal is delicious
The only pity is that the generous table of many people is not good to sit and easily hit the feet"
"餐點非常細緻
酒類物品除了好喝之外也非常漂亮

People who like to take pictures and punch cards are very recommended"
"環境舒適寬敞

推薦點松露奶香義大利麵，平均每道餐點價格大約 $400起跳，氛圍好、食物好吃、調酒也很精心設計。建議約會情侶、朋友聚會可以來感受氣氛。,"Recommended pine -dew milk fragrance pasta, the average price of each meal is about $ 400, the atmosphere is good, the food is delicious, and the bartending is also carefully designed.It is recommended that dating couples and friends can feel the atmosphere."
"隱身在巷弄間的餐酒館
氣氛不錯
酒的擺設也有主題
聊天 小酌 聚餐
會是一個很棒的地方
值得大家來一趟","The dining tavern in the alley
The atmosphere is good
There are also themes of wine furnishings
Chat dinner dinner
It will be a great place
It's worth everyone"
必須說，從預約到現場的感受都普普，但上菜到調酒都驚為天人，沒有想過食材可以這樣處理，不管是飯局、酒局都是值得再訪的口袋名單！！！,"It must be said that the feelings from the appointment to the scene are all Pupu, but it is shocked by the food to the bartender. I have never thought that the ingredients can be dealt with like this. Whether it is the dinner or the wine bureau is worth visiting the pocket list!IntersectionIntersection"
不值這個價格，份量很小，上菜很慢,"It is not worth the price, the portion is small, and the food is very slow"
很有聖誕氛圍的餐廳！餐點也好吃，推推～,"Very Christmas atmosphere restaurant!The meal is delicious, push push ~"
價位偏高但服務跟口味都不錯，海鮮選項偏多，辣味的食物也偏多,"The price is high, the service and the taste are good, there are more seafood options, and the spicy foods are too much"
氣氛好，餐點美味,"Good atmosphere, delicious meals"
"看到Google評論很多都說服務好，所以滿心期待來用餐。
結果發現比我們晚來的客人都有迎賓飲料，只有我們沒有。
詢問才知道原來是忘記給了
（抵達時餐廳大概不到5組客人）

店員收桌蠻積極的，但是連我們尚在食用中的餐點夾子也要收走（廣島煎食追）😅","Seeing a lot of Google Reviews, I said that the service is good, so I look forward to eating.
It was found that there were welcome drinks than we came later, only we did not.
I asked that I knew it was forgotten to give it
(When you arrive, the restaurant is about 5 groups of guests)

The clerk's table is quite positive, but even the meal clip we are still eating must be taken away (Hiroshima fried food chasing) 😅"
酒很特別也很好喝！,Wine is very special and delicious!
"菜單在二維碼中，他們會過來告訴你想吃什麼。
一開始的湯很棒，鹹鹹的，味道很熟悉。

加海鹽的薯條非常好吃，比普通的薯條更脆，更鹹。
這些可能是我最近吃過的最好的。儘管已經上桌了一段時間而且不熱，但它們的味道仍然很棒。

披薩也酥脆可口，但有點太辣了。我覺得肉醬的用量可以減少。然而，Scrocchiarella 麵包、起司和台灣香腸絕對更上一層樓，羅勒也是如此。

提拉米蘇比預期的好得多，也大得多。上面的奶油非常美味。此外，喜歡布丁光滑柔軟的質地。
裡面的蛋糕和酥脆的餅乾粉一起非常美味。

總之，這裡的所有員工都非常友善、熱情並且願意幫助客戶。浪漫的氣氛很適合約會用餐。服務和效率也在很大程度上。唯一的缺點是最低收費很高，每人800美元。這裡的地中海美食和裝飾品也很道地。

總的來說，所有的食物味道都很好，我會給這頓飯 9 分（滿分 10 分）！
將來一定會回來吃薯條。","The menu is in the QR code, and they will come to tell you what you want to eat.
The soup at the beginning was great, salty and familiar.

The fries with sea salt are very delicious, more crispy and salty than ordinary potato strips.
These may be the best I have ever recently eaten.Although it has been served for a while and it is not hot, their taste is still great.

Pizza is crispy and delicious, but a bit too spicy.I think the amount of meat sauce can be reduced.However, Scrocchiarella's bread, cheese, and Taiwan sausage are definitely more up to the next level, as well as Laler.

Tiramisby expects much better and much bigger.The cream on it is very delicious.In addition, like pudding smooth and soft texture.
The cake inside is very delicious with crispy biscuits.

In short, all the employees here are very friendly, enthusiastic and willing to help customers.The romantic atmosphere is suitable for dating.Services and efficiency are also largely.The only disadvantage is that the minimum charging is very high, each 800 US dollars.The Mediterranean cuisine and decorations here are also very authentic.

In general, all the food tastes very good, I will give this meal 9 points (10 points)!
In the future, I will definitely come back to eat fries."
"滄海遺珠（不易發覺的美。很棒的食物、飲料和服務。舒適的氛圍，精美的裝飾和特色設計。

很棒的客戶服務，絕對是一流的。參加這個地方的生日晚宴。他們非常靈活地滿足了我們所有的要求。工作人員非常專業而且非常有禮貌和友好。良好的英語水平使其成為海外遊客的理想之地。

他們的雞尾酒很棒。我會再次訪問。即使只是喝一杯。對於這樣的標準的地方來說價格合理。

推薦店主上TripAdvisor，以吸引更多國際客人。","Canghai legacy (beauty that is not easy to discover. Great food, beverages and services. A comfortable atmosphere, exquisite decoration and characteristic design.

A great customer service is definitely first -class.Participate in this place of birthday dinner.They are very flexible to meet all our requirements.The staff is very professional and very polite and friendly.Good English level makes it ideal for overseas tourists.

Their cocktails are great.I will visit again.Even if you just drink a drink.The price is reasonable for such standards.

Recommended shopkeeper to TripAdvisor to attract more international guests."
食物真的很好吃！飲料也很棒。氣氛很好，但是音樂太大聲，你不能在大桌子上吃得很好。,"The food is really delicious!Drinks are also great.The atmosphere is good, but the music is too loud, you can't eat well on the big table."
我們點了一份開胃菜、一盤沙拉、一份鮪魚主菜和一份義大利麵。它們味道都不錯，但有點重。另外，它有點貴。,"We ordered a appetizer, a plate of salad, a catfish main course and a pasta.They taste good, but a bit heavy.In addition, it is a bit expensive."
"這家店的氛圍非常時尚舒適。
飲料和食物都非常美味。
菜色為義大利麵、牛排等地中海菜系。
座位很舒服，感覺就像飯店的休息室。","The atmosphere of this shop is very fashionable and comfortable.
Drinks and food are very delicious.
The dishes are the Mediterranean cuisine such as pasta, steaks, etc.
The seat is very comfortable, and it feels like the lounge of the restaurant."
好的',OK'
台北相當不錯的「歐洲」食物。與其他類似的地方相比有點貴。不過，這是一次很棒的經歷，工作人員非常友好。泰德非常照顧我們，讓一頓典型的晚餐變得非常美味！,"Taipei's ""Europe"" food.Compared with other similar places, it is a bit expensive.However, this is a great experience, and the staff is very friendly.Ted takes care of us very much, making a typical dinner very delicious!"
出乎意料的非常好的地中海食物，不僅僅是一道菜，而且都很美味，而且技術上非常正確……廚師太棒了！,"The unexpectedly very good Mediterranean food is not only a dish, but also very delicious, but also very technically correct ... The chef is great!"
非常好的地方，很棒的員工，超酷的菜單和很棒的葡萄酒選擇。價格也很有競爭力,"Very good place, great employees, cool menu and great wine choices.The price is also very competitive"
這是一個非常令人驚嘆的地方，而且有著非常令人驚嘆的氛圍。我們嘗試了一些食物方面的東西，而且一切都執行得非常好。松露薯條讓人愛不釋手，而他們的香蕉飲料基本上就是眾神的甘露。,這是一個非常令人驚嘆的地方，而且有著非常令人驚嘆的氛圍。我們嘗試了一些食物方面的東西，而且一切都執行得非常好。松露薯條讓人愛不釋手，而他們的香蕉飲料基本上就是眾神的甘露。

However, chocolate Brownie desserts need a little more ice cream."
很棒的氛圍、食物和服務。,"A great atmosphere, food and services."
"服務生態度無可挑剔，非常有禮貌。食物很坑人，牛排特別差。

RE老闆：關鍵在於你如何烹飪，你確實毀了最好的牛排。","The service ecology is impeccable and very polite.The food is very pitted, and the steak is particularly bad.

Boss Ry: The key is how you cook, you do ruin the best steak."
