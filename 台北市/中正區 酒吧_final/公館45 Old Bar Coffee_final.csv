"相對便宜的一間酒吧！
在中藥店上面比較難注意到，不過裡面的裝潢就真的很酒吧了xD

這次點了幾杯調酒。
大多都在100-200之間，除非點特別貴的像環遊世界、殭屍等等。
Singapore Sling的調酒配方本來就都不盡相同，這間的酒的苦味稍重一些，比較推薦給喜歡酒味的人。
但個人沒有特別喜歡就是了，就是中上但有CP值的一杯調酒。

Sea Breeze第一次喝。
酒味稍淡，莓果味有但比較偏清甜。
比較適合不太喝酒想喝不甜的果汁的人喝。

Rusty Nail喝起來就只有威士忌味啦其實xD
不過威士忌基底的調酒本來就會有這個問題（威士忌搶味），所以就不強求了xD

長島冰茶這家偏酸，萊姆味非常濃厚。
酒精味稍有一點，但含量跟別家比沒有特別濃（就喉嚨的感覺）。
不喜歡酒味可以Pass，但平常有喝酒的也不用怕這杯太容易掛。
沒喝酒的還是Pass吧xDDD

CHI CHI我是第一次喝，意外的蠻喜歡的。
這杯是奶酒，是以伏特加為基底加椰奶去做調配。
個人覺得伏特加香氣有出來，椰奶搭配得恰到好處。
不會太膩也不會過淡，某方面很像在喝甜度適中的摩摩喳喳。
滿推薦可以試試看的。

食物部分有點薯條、培根蘆筍捲、爆米花、Chips & Salsa跟鹹派。

爆米花簡單來說就是大碗，滿配酒的。
80塊有一整碗還蠻爽的，算推薦。
但要注意它是鹹的喔。

培根蘆筍捲說實話沒有很推。
蘆筍大概兩三根，包在不大的培根裡。
六捲賣100多說實話真的偏貴。

Chips&Salsa這家店是用有起司粉的多力多滋做的。
不小碗的又用起司的，成本真的沒問題嗎xD
但說實話起司味有點蓋過莎莎醬的味道。

薯條就是薯條。
挺脆的也滿多根，可以點個。

鹹派反而喜出望外。
本身蠻好吃的，又有附香蒜麵包跟沙拉。
價錢跟蘆筍捲差不多卻份量跟滿足感大超多，非常推薦。

服務的話並沒有太出色，大概就平庸。
沒什麼出色的地方但也沒讓我不開心，禮尚往來這樣。
比較特別的是他們點餐都是先付，加點再點這樣。
像我們這次就加點五六次所以就一直跑櫃檯然後算很多次錢，說實話有點困擾。
但還在可接受範圍內囉。

另外就是一個小提醒，他們的酒單的中文翻譯有些滿特別的，沒在其他地方看過。
像Tequila Sunrise叫墨西哥日出、Mojito叫古巴特調等等。
當初看古巴特調還以為是自由古巴🤔
如果不知道英文酒名的可能會以為是別的酒，但試試看也不錯啦😂

簡單來說還是很推薦，這個價錢真的蠻划算的。
但口味就見仁見智了。
食物推薦鹹派，80元系列也滿划算的。
不過這家也很多人會去，常客滿。
所以記得早點來喔～","A cheap bar!
It is difficult to notice in the Chinese medicine store, but the decoration inside is really a bar XD

I ordered a few cups of bartending this time.
Most of them are between 100-200, unless you like to travel around the world, zombies, and so on.
Singapore Sling's bartending formula is not the same. The bitterness of this wine is slightly heavier. It is recommended to people who like wine.
But individuals do n’t have particularly like it. It is a cup of bartending with a CP value.

Sea Breeze first drank for the first time.
The taste of the wine is slightly lighter, and the flavor of the berry is relatively sweet.
It is more suitable for people who do n’t drink too much drink.

Rusty nail is only whiskey flavor, but XD is actually XD
However, the whiskey base will have this problem (whiskey grab the taste), so I will not force XD

Long Island Ice Tea is sour, and Lim flavor is very strong.
The taste of alcohol is a little bit, but the content is not particularly thicker than others (the feeling of throat).
If you do n’t like the taste of wine, you can pass, but you usually do n’t have to worry about drinking. This cup is too easy to hang.
If you don’t drink, you are still Pass. XDDD

Chi Chi, I was drinking for the first time, I liked it unexpectedly.
This cup is milk wine, which is based on vodka and coconut milk.
Personally, the vodka aroma is out, and coconut milk is just right.
It won't be too greasy or too light, in some ways, it is very much like Momo who is drinking sweetly.
Full recommendation can try it.

The food part is a bit of fries, bacon asparagus rolls, popcorn, Chips & SALSA and Xianpai.

In short, the popcorn is a large bowl, full of alcohol.
There is a whole bowl of 80 pieces. It is quite cool. It is recommended.
But note that it is salty.

To be honest, bacon asparagus rolls are not very pushed.
The asparagus is about two or three, wrapped in a small bacon.
Six volumes selling more than 100 to be honest is really expensive.

Chips & SALSA is made of cheese powder.
If you are a small bowl, you use cheese, the cost is really okay? XD
But to be honest, the cheese flavor was a bit covered with Sasa sauce.

French fries are fries.
There are a lot of crispy, you can click.

Instead, Xianpai was overjoyed.
It is pretty delicious, and there are fragrant garlic bread and salad.
The price is almost the same as the asparagus roll, but the weight is much more satisfied, and it is very recommended.

If the service is not excellent, it is probably mediocre.
There is no excellent place, but I didn't make me unhappy, and the ritual exchanges.
The more special thing is that they are paid first before ordering, adding it and ordering.
Like we added five or six times this time, we have been running the counter and then counting a lot of money. To be honest, it is a bit troublesome.
But within the acceptable range.

The other is a small reminder. The Chinese translation of their wine list is a bit special and has not been seen in other places.
Like Tequila Sunrise called Mexico's sunrise, Mojito called Cubarto, and so on.
When I saw Cuba special, I thought it was free Cuba 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔 🤔
If you don’t know the name of the English wine, you may think it is another wine, but it ’s good to try it.

In simple terms, it is still very recommended. This price is really cost -effective.
But the taste is wise.
Food is recommended for Xianpai, and the 80 yuan series is also cost -effective.
However, many people will go, often full.

當朋友來台北時，總是首選。這裡又黑又髒，但氣氛很好，是暢飲一夜的完美場所。廁所窗簾需要更換一下（距離上次更換已經有幾十年了。）。從街上看，這個地方並不明顯，但走上垂直的樓梯，你就會進入一個酒精濃度很高的塔迪斯。 DJ 接受請求。你需要製作紙飛機並投擲它們，因為它們在酒吧上方的浮動平台上工作。,"When a friend comes to Taipei, it is always the first choice.Here is dark and dirty, but the atmosphere is very good.
