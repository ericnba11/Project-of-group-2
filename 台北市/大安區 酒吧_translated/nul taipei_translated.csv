另外拍貼機如果當天組數多要排隊可能吃到一半隨時要去拍照，當下有詢問拍照時間是否可以往後延，服務生告知可以但要重新排到最後一組，但餐才剛上沒多久。

當天服務生把我們點的餐點送的隔壁桌後發現送錯，餐點也未更換直接再出給我們，如果非疫情期間完全沒問題，但隔壁桌客人當下沒戴口罩在聊天，真的覺得在吃隔壁客人的口水，疫情期間應該更認真對待這種問題吧……

Although the taste of the meal is pretty special, the favorite is salad, the discharge and the staple food are ordinary. The point is that a dining tavern only gives you a lunch time, but the speed of serving is not as fast as a bento shop.

When the checkout leaves, there are a lot of empty tables in the store, and there are only one group of guests outside. In this case, they are unwilling to give a little buffer time. Full, in short, it is definitely not because of the total amount.

"結論：粉紅氣泡水一杯$250不爽被當盤子🙃

前陣子來用餐，因為人數多（7人）他的份量蠻小的比較適合3-4人的聚會
不然會像我們一樣菜單點一輪還沒吃飽又錢包破洞
整體食物好吃不會雷👌

比較讓人傻眼的是因為有朋友開車所以不能喝酒
請店員推薦無酒精的飲料，店員推薦新出的調味氣泡水也沒其他選擇就點了四杯
來的時候著實傻眼粉紅色、喝起來有氣泡、重點只有1/3滿⋯⋯⋯⋯大概50ml吧（無酒精）
想說他菜單上一杯氣泡水$160（不知道多大杯）應該無酒精也差不多這價錢
到了結帳最後一杯粉紅色氣泡水要$250⋯
我們還點了四杯，覺得我們喝了四杯的量只等於1杯吧！！！那杯水沒有什麼特別的沒有擺設沒有水果就是粉紅色氣泡水還沒有裝滿
所以我們也沒有想要拍照⋯
仔細看我照片右上角 就是那杯粉紅色氣泡水還沒有喝過！就是那麼小杯！
菜單上沒價格、店員也未告知價格
不知情況下就被當了盤子呢💩

當天用餐冷氣好像也壞掉了！我們很熱、店員額頭也冒汗

拍貼機很有梗，但需要另外加價$100/次
所以整晚吃下來含拍照費用$1100左右

整體用餐體驗不佳 提供大家參考
整體食物還是好吃的～

I came to dine a while ago, because the number of people (7 people) was quite small for 3-4 people.
Otherwise, it will be like us for a round, not enough to eat, and the wallet breaks the hole
The overall food is delicious, can't thunder 整 整 整 整 整

What is more dumbfounded is that you can’t drink because a friend drove
Ask the clerk to recommend alcoholic drinks, and the clerk recommends the new seasoning air bubble water. There are no other choices to order four cups.
When I came, it was dumbfounded pink, drinking bubbles, and only 1/3 of the key points. About 50ml (no alcohol)
Want to say that his menu is a cup of bubble water $ 160 (I don’t know how big cups) should be alcohol without alcohol.
At the checkout's last cup of pink bubbles, it is $ 250 ...
We also ordered four cups, and felt that the amount of four cups was equal to 1 cup!IntersectionIntersectionThere is nothing special about that cup of water, no furnishings, no fruits, but pink bubble water, not full
So we don't want to take pictures either ...
Take a closer look at the upper right corner of my photo is the cup of pink bubbles. I haven't drank it yet!It's so small!
There is no price on the menu, and the clerk does not tell the price
I have been taken as a plate without knowing the circumstances 💩

The air -conditioning that day seemed to be broken!We are hot, and the clerk's forehead is sweating

The shooting machine is very stalk, but the additional price is needed for $ 100/time
So eat all night and contain about $ 1100

The overall dining experience is not good, provide everyone's reference
The overall food is still delicious ~

Look at the photos, no matter how many MLs are from the perception, it is not good.
Maybe we don't understand the golf bubble wine bar

這家餐廳算是混合式的餐廳都有，芋頭鴨肉要搭配旁邊的醃漬水果吃，味道搭配得宜，飯的話味道濃郁，但是過鹹。最後上的是豬肉，豬肋排配上花生醬，有點不搭，然後松阪豬也切的太厚了！豬尾巴好吃！除了上述說明外，主要是覺得CP值不高，餐點配料雖然新穎，但搭配吃起來卻不是很合。,"This restaurant is a mixed restaurant.

麵不是義大利麵那種麵體，有點像比較厚的扁麵

應該是他們特調的醬 味道很特別
不過沒有非常合我胃口

炸雞的部分也表現普通，炸皮多過於肉的感覺

Mocktail of the day is lychee grapefruit
There is no lychee flavor but it is not bad to drink a little cup

The material of the shrimp noodles is about 9-10 clams, two shrimps, and 3-4 pieces of flower branches
Noodles are not the type of pasta, it is a bit like a thick flat surface
I thought it would have a strong shrimp flavor (after all, called shrimp noodles)
It should be their special sauce taste special
But it's not very good for my stomach

The fried chicken is also ordinary, and the fried skin is more than that of more fleshy skin
The sauce shopman next to the sauce said it was their special three cup of chicken sauce

餐廳服務蠻好的，很親切很主動，沒什麼服務不周的問題
餐點的份量也蠻足夠的，不會有吃不飽的問題

下面是餐點評論：
1.蝦鬆因為加了燻鮭魚⋯所以其實吃不太出來蝦鬆味，主要都是燻鮭魚的味道蓋過去了

2.玉米燉飯其實我覺得應該要改名叫做起士玉米燉飯⋯整碗有著濃郁的起士味，所以吃不太出來有什麼玉米⋯

3.蝦麵⋯⋯海鮮不太新鮮，透抽有腥味，而且麵條很像是乾拌麵用的扁麵條，蠻失望的

4.炸雞吃了幾塊就覺得很油膩，不太耐吃，但肉質很好、沾醬調味也很不錯

看大家都讚不絕口，所以我在想可能是我吃不習慣嗎⋯ 不過我個人是不會再回訪的，我覺得走這種路線的料理應該還可以再做到更好。","I ate this meal very seriously, so I also give it seriously to comment

The restaurant has a good service, very kind and active, and there is no problem with no service.
The amount of the meal is quite sufficient, there will be no problem of eating

The following is a meal comments:
1. Shrimp pine is added because the smoked salmon is added. In fact, the shrimp pine flavor can not be eaten.

2. In fact, I think the corn stewed rice should be renamed called cheese corn stew rice. The whole bowl has a strong cheese flavor, so I don’t eat it.

3. Shrimp noodles are not very fresh, seafood has a fishy smell, and the noodles are very like a flat noodle for dry noodles, which is quite disappointed.

4. Fried chicken feels very greasy and not durable after eating a few pieces, but the meat is very good, and the smell of sauce is also very good.

但6/2晚上用餐時外場男店員的態度讓人家覺得不太舒服

四個客人只帶了兩杯shot來，就已經讓人覺得店員不是很有禮貌跟設想不夠周全
原本想說算了，我們確實因為晚到還沒點酒

但之後我和新來的第五位朋友也都有跟該位店員點酒（最後五個人總共點了五杯酒）
該位店員又靠桌說要再請我們喝shot
但同時他詢問剛剛他請過shot的兩個女生朋友是不是先走了？
我們表示她們先離開了
該位店員回一句 好可惜，然後就直接離開
說好要請我們喝的shot也沒有請
原來不是有點酒的人才能請喝
這樣的行為不只讓人感覺到服務差別待遇，也覺得對女生客人，以及我們其他有點酒的人都很不尊重

付了相同的錢 同桌卻差別待遇很不舒服
對於聽到女客人離開表示「好可惜」？
然後答應請喝shot的行為直接不了了之

But the attitude of the male clerk in the outside world at the evening of 6/2 makes people feel uncomfortable
There were four people at our table. The clerk said that he would ask for drinks. When we came, he only took two cups and said that he could only ask two girls who had a little wine to drink.
The four guests only brought two cups of shot, and they already made people think that the clerk was not very polite and the idea was not enough
Originally, I wanted to say it, we are indeed because it is too late to order

But after that, the fifth friends and I also had a drink with the clerk (the last five people ordered a total of five glasses of wine)
The clerk rely on the table and said that he would invite us to drink shot again
But at the same time, he asked if the two girls and friends who had invited Shot just left first?
We said they left first
It is a pity that the clerk is a pity, and then leave directly
Say it is good to invite us to drink.
It turns out that it is not a bit of alcohol to ask for drinking
This kind of behavior not only makes people feel the differential treatment, but also feels that they are not respecting girls and guests, as well as other people who are some of our alcohol.

Pay the same money at the same table but the difference is very uncomfortable
I said ""unfortunately"" to hear female guests from leaving?

"等待時間很準確，準時讓我們進場，員工服務態度良好，但餐點我覺得絕對有改進的地方。
1.炸雞翅
喜歡韓式炸雞的朋友絕對不能錯過，真的很好吃，雞皮酥脆，肉質鮮嫩，韓式醬淋上簡直如虎添翼，極推！
2.甜菜燉飯
顏色非常適合拍照，味道也非常入味，點綴的蔬菜更是讓整盤菜達到色香味俱全，也是非常推薦的一道好菜。
3.炸雞
擺盤用心，醬汁感覺是特調的，肉質也是非常鮮嫩，味道也相當入味，值得推薦。
4.今日湯
是蛤蜊加檸檬，一開始我覺得有點怪，但很創意，而且其實蠻好喝的，沒有想過這樣的搭配，但是是清湯，如果不能接受的朋友要斟酌點餐，員工有告知是偏清爽的湯，但因為我們當天點的都是偏西式的餐味道較重，所以有點不搭，想嚐鮮的朋友可以試試看。
5.豬肉
豬味非常重，可能有些人很愛有些人不愛。
6.羊肉
去腥做的很好，味道比豬肉還沒腥味，如果敢吃羊，比較推薦點羊。

接下來就是一些意見參考了，個人感覺。
7.蝦麵
我非常愛吃蝦子，他們的蝦子入味，只是麵味道很濃的蟹膏或是蝦膏味，應該是為了提點整盤麵的主味，但我個人覺得太濃郁了，口水分泌不夠多會來不及吃，感覺可以再改進，整體味道不算糟，就是有點難下嚥，因為真的太濃了，吃到最後有點膩。
8.溫沙拉
今日點餐地雷餐，有點酸這對沙拉來說很正常，但你知道又溫溫的，味道有點像……，這部分一定可以改進，畢竟不是單價便宜的地方，吃到這道差點把前面吃的都拿出來了。

2. Stewed rice
The color is very suitable for taking pictures, and the taste is very flavorful. The decorated vegetables make the whole dish reaches the color and fragrance. It is also a very recommended good dish.
3. Fried chicken
With the heart of the plate, the sauce feels special, the meat is very tender, the taste is quite flavorful, it is worth recommending.
4. Today's soup
It was clam and lemon. At first I felt a little weird, but very creative, and it was actually very delicious. I never thought about such a match, but it was clear soup. If you ca n’t accept friends, you need to consider ordering. The employees have notified that it is refreshing. The soup, but because we all ordered the western -style meal that day, we were a bit disapproval. Friends who want to try something new can try it.
5. Pork
The pig taste is very heavy, and some people may love some people.
6. mutton
It is very good to make fishy, ​​and the taste is not less fishy than pork. If you dare to eat sheep, I recommend some sheep.

Next is some opinions for reference, personal feelings.
7. Shrimp noodles
I love shrimp very much. Their shrimp tastes, but the flavor of crab paste or shrimp paste with strong noodles should be to lift the main taste of the whole plate of noodles, but I personally think it is too rich. Eating, it feels like it can be improved. The overall taste is not bad, but it is a bit difficult, because it is really too strong, and it is a bit greasy at the end.
8. Wimbled
Ordering the morqual meal today is a bit sour for salad, but you know and warm, the taste is a bit like ..., this part can be improved. After all, it is not a cheap place. I took it out.

雖然有事先告知110分鐘用餐時間，但是服務人員真的給人非常大的壓力，已經告知希望等朋友到了再介紹菜單，但朋友一到、我們還在對話時就直接急著打斷說要介紹菜單，這時才告知110分鐘是從訂位時間開始起算，出餐不用時間嗎？且時間快到時就不停詢問是否可以先幫我們買單，很有一種店家急著想把我們趕走的感覺

原本滿期待用餐，整趟下來真的滿滿負評，真的只是為了拍貼機去的⋯⋯（但想到其實信義區也有就覺得好像不用特別去，至少信義區還有很涼的冷氣🫠）

主餐選擇不多，很多人大推的蝦麵也沒有在當日菜單上，而且一間餐酒館用餐時間還那麼短甚至上菜速度也是普通…整頓飯都吃得很趕又很熱，朋友連調酒不夠冰想加冰塊還被服務人員勸阻…🫠

"先說結論：不推薦，有其他更好的選擇。
理由如下：
1. 訂位和七點半入場時皆無告知用餐時間限制，但卻在吃到9.30時開始提醒用餐時間僅到10點，且有被收盤子趕人的感覺。
2. 有吸煙室，但抽風沒有做到非常好，一進店就有濃濃的煙味。
3. 餐點表現普通，CP值低：(1)蝦麵沒有鮮味，且麵條選擇寬麵，口感搭配不佳。(2)燉飯收汁不全，整盤像粥。(3)特色蝦鬆完全不鬆，反而是黏稠口感，相當失望。(4)烤章魚為單價最高的餐點，680元/份，但表現跟夜市的烤魷魚差不多，沒有特別驚豔。
4. 調酒平衡度不佳，且特色調酒酒單沒有註明所使用的基酒：(1)negaroni twisted的特色調酒只喝得到campari的苦味。(2)茶酒苦澀味重，與服務生介紹的香甜口感差距大。(3)NO.2精油or利口酒味過於突出。
5. 服務員訓練或溝通不佳：慶生切蛋糕要收取200元清潔費，但卻因服務員疏失破壞當晚驚喜。9.30説用餐時間只到10點卻拿10點後的menu詢問我們要點什麼？

以上皆為個人親自體驗後所記錄的實際心得，提供參考。","Let's talk about the conclusion: No recommendation, there are other better choices.
The reason is as follows:
1. There is no meal time limit when the reservation and seven:30 are entered, but when you eat it 9.30, the meal time is only 10 o'clock, and it feels like being closed.
2. There is a smoking room, but the wind is not very good. When you enter the store, you have a strong smoke smell.
3. The meal is ordinary, and the CP value is low: (1) the shrimp noodles have no umami flavor, and the noodles are wide -noodles, and the taste is not good.(2) The stew is incomplete, and the whole plate is like porridge.(3) Special shrimp pine is not loose at all, but it is sticky and disappointed.(4) Baked octopus is the highest unit price meal, 680 yuan/serving, but it is similar to the grilled squid that performs in the night market. It is not particularly amazing.
4. The balance of bartending is not good, and the specialty wine list does not indicate the use wine used: (1) The special bartending of Negaroni Twisted only drinks the bitterness of Campari.(2) The bitterness of tea and wine is heavy, and the sweet taste introduced with the waiter is large.(3) NO.2 Essential Oil OR Lok wine tastes too prominent.
5. Workers training or poor communication: Celebrating the cake of Celebrate to charge 200 yuan for cleaning fee, but the surprise of the night due to the waiter's negligence.9.30 said that the meal time was only 10 o'clock but took Menu at 10 o'clock and asked what we wanted?

"吃到壞掉的海鮮，隔天腹瀉超嚴重，餐點上菜速度不夠快沒關係，但準時趕人的部分讓人印象不佳，蛋糕都切到一半才說要收清潔費，真的待改進。

回覆：先謝謝店家讓我們先進去包廂休息，但講先不說是否言重了，這不是你們的義務，你們也可以讓我們在外面等就好了。但冰蛋糕的過程，友人很確定你們沒有事先告知要收清潔費200元，沒有參與到冰蛋糕過程的我沒資格評論什麼，但海鮮不新鮮是肯定的，因為同行的友人只有點蝦麵的人有腹瀉狀況，有這麼剛好的話我也不知道，因為我當天為了這餐早上只有喝一杯豆漿，蛋糕我也是隔天才吃的，所以我確定不是蛋糕的問題。
關於低消，建議你們第一次點餐的時候告知還差多少金額，不然可能中間你們一忙會忘記，到我們都吃很飽用餐時間也快到的時候才說真的感受不佳，我們本來是加點前就已經準備要吃蛋糕，是為了點到低消才延誤到後面客人用餐時間。
我自己也是第一次留評價，只是說出感想，並沒有要打擊你們的意思，然而貴餐廳卻覺得我們是不實指控，覺得傻眼！","After eating bad seafood, the diarrhea is very serious the next day. It doesn't matter if the meal is not fast enough, but the part of the time to catch people is not impressive. Essence
