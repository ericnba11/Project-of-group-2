"這是一家由葡萄酒進口商直營的Wine Bar，很隱密的座落巷弄之，店內有販售許多各式各樣的葡萄酒，且價格都相當的親民實惠，有別於外面酒吧的售價，就連消費模式也僅收水資100元(Evian礦泉水& Ferrarelle天然氣泡礦泉水暢飲)，葡萄酒牌價販售，因此你可以在店裡喝到一瓶不到2000元的法國香檳，也有2萬左右的法國五大，千元以內的法國、義大利、西班牙、智利、阿根廷、澳洲、美國…等優質葡萄酒，還有義大利知名的酒渣白蘭地Grappa。

因此店內只做整瓶販售，沒有提供單杯服務，只有30年蘇格蘭威士忌有做單杯銷售，此外店內也有提供包場服務，只要8000元(限8人，超過人數每位加收1000元)並且可抵低消。

目前店只營業周三~周六晚上19:30~23:30，有時包場不對外營業，因此建議先電話洽詢、預約。","This is a Wine Bar, which is directly run by wine importers. It is very secretive.

The five major France, France, Italy, Spain, Chile, Chile, Argentina, Australia, the United States, etc. within 1,000 yuan, and the well -known Italian GrapPa.
