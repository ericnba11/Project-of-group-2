"去年在 Le Ming 用餐時對於拉麵的麵條以及豐潤的湯頭感到驚豔不已，不過今日用餐覺得落差有點大。

整體來說，Le Ming 的「原味雞湯麵（$260）」的湯頭、麵條以及配料（肉、娃娃菜）在味覺上各自為政，壁壘分明，似乎是貌合神離的情侶似的；而「法式蝦蟹濃湯麵（$380）」的麵條也有種脫離地球軌道，逕自奔向銀河系深處的感覺，整碗吃下來覺得頗為可惜。

如果真的要以今日湯麵的表現給分的話，只能說差強人意，不過餐點的評價終究是個人的主觀意識，或許是腦內的記憶美化加成也不一定。

與以前相比，可以看出主廚持續追求進化的意念，從澄黃的法式高湯變成泡系（foam）的做法。

拉麵搭配娃娃菜是較少見的組合，撇除麵條沒有巴住湯汁不說，法式高湯還是十分暖心美味的，忍不住就乾碗了。

如果真的要以今日湯麵的表現給分的話，應該是 3.0，但畢竟口味較為個人，加上服務態度親切，整體還是好評。

▎店家：le ming 麵食精釀餐酒館
▎區域／鄰近地點：新北林口／林口三井OUTLET
▎拉麵名稱／價格：黑咖哩沾麵(雞)／240
▎配置：雞叉燒

林口又開了新拉麵店了！
這對我來說是件非常大的好消息，因為這樣我想吃麵就近的選擇變多了！

le ming 麵食精釀餐酒館開在住宅區，附近算好停車。
大眾運輸的話從三井走路來也算方便~

該店主打有：『雞白湯、沾麵系列，當然還有精釀啤酒！』
所以非常適合拉酒幫的成員，店內的環境也裝潢的很舒適，也適合家庭客。

▎黑咖哩沾麵(雞):
先說嘗試其他麵友的品項，白蘭地系列我們一致覺得酒味太強烈明顯了。
跟一燈的酒蛋給我的感受一樣，如果喜歡的人應該就會很愛。

雞白湯系列很順口，以這附近客群的考量呈現我覺得這樣很棒！

黑咖哩沾麵有點辣度，雖然店家說些微但是我吃完也是包了一堆水餃就是了。(苦笑

沾湯濃度非常濃稠，而且帶有些微的酸，我剛從希臘土耳其的番茄洗禮回來一吃就知道有番茄...
雖然我是番茄勇者，但是連續考驗24天回台灣還要繼續，我真的是勇者無誤！(挺

麵條中粗，口感Q彈。
我個人沾一半麵體吃就很夠味了，不過吃完沾湯也沒了...TAT

連湯割都沒辦法，我事後跟店主提到這件事情，店主說沾湯如果不夠的話可以在加！真是太佛了~

配料的部分，都是走口感清脆的路線。
像蓮藕片、川耳、海帶類，都是這樣的呈現。

另外雞肉叉燒呈現很用心，擺盤成花的形狀！
這我目前拉麵店只有在日本有吃過這樣的呈現，台灣這是第一次。

溏心蛋原本預設的調味帶有點酸味，事後問是有加檸檬；
不過吃的時候檸檬不太明顯且酸味容易被誤會，這有跟店主稍微說了一下。

整體，這是一間用心的拉麵店！
而且還有沾麵又更是不簡單，很適合下班來吃碗麵喝個啤酒，做為美好一天的結束的店~ ：D

▎干貝雞湯+松露干貝雞湯:
兩碗的差異在配料上，湯底是一樣的。
松露多了幾片叉燒、一顆生食級的干貝。

湯主打W雙湯頭(雞湯+干貝)的湯，味道上比較屬於新手入門的等級。
濃度和味道對於常吃拉麵的麵友會有點騷不到癢處，不知道未來有沒有客製化調整的可能?!

就拉麵來說我會比較推薦點松露那碗，因為湯的味道還有松露來加強略顯不足的部分。

干貝雞湯那碗的叉燒擺盤呈現花的形狀，這樣子的擺盤已經漸漸在台灣開始看到了。
目前台北隱家也會有這樣的呈現，另外在這次社團的武藏麵聚肉點的多的麵友也有這樣的呈現。

配料因為都是原味的呈現，所以整體就是以湯的味道為主軸。

我自己吃完我下次再來應該就是選擇沾麵了，上次沾麵的記憶點對我來說比拉麵好。","★ Ramen fans, please enter → FB search: ""Taiwan Ramen Hobbies""

In ▎ ▎: le ming pasta brewed restaurant
近 Area / Neighborhood: New Beidou / Linkou Mitsui Outlet
价格 Ramen Name / Price: Black Curry Dip Trocket (Chicken) / 240
Configuration: chicken barbecake

Linkou opened a new ramen shop again!
This is a very good news for me, because so I want to eat more choices to eat!

Le Ming Pastricular Cast Restaurant is opened in the residential area, and parking is counted nearby.
It is convenient to walk from Mitsui if you transport it ~

The owner of the shop has: ""Chicken white soup, stained noodle series, of course, there are craft beer!""
Therefore, it is very suitable for members who pull the wine gang. The environment in the store is also very comfortable and suitable for family guests.

沾 Black Curry Dip Flood (Chicken):
Let's talk about the items of other noodle friends first. We feel that the taste of the wine is too strong.
Like a lamp's wine egg, if you like people, you should love it.

The chicken white soup series is very smooth, and I think it is great in the consideration of the nearby customer group!

The black curry noodles are a bit spicy. Although the store said a little, I also wrapped a bunch of dumplings after eating.(wry smile

The concentration of dipping soup is very thick, and with a little sour. I just know that there are tomatoes when I eat it from the baptism of tomatoes in Greece and Turkey ...
Although I am a tomato brave, I still have to continue the test back to Taiwan for 24 days. I am really a brave!(quite

The noodles are thick and the taste is Q bombs.
I personally eat half a halley to eat, but it ’s not enough to eat the soup ... TAT

There was no way to cut soup. I mentioned this to the owner afterwards. The owner said that if it is not enough, you can add it!It's so Buddha ~

The part of the ingredients is a crispy route.
Like lotus root slices, Sichuan ear, kelp, all are presented.

In addition, chicken barbecued pork shower is very intentional, and the shape of the flowers into flowers!
This is the first time that I have eaten this ramen shop in Japan. This is the first time in Taiwan.

The preset flavor of the heart egg has a sour flavor. Afterwards, ask it to add lemon;
However, when eating, the lemon is not obvious and the sour taste is easy to be misunderstood.

Overall, this is a careful ramen shop!
And it is not easy to stick to the noodles. It is very suitable for getting get off work to eat bowl noodles to drink beer.

+Dry scallop chicken soup+truffle scallop chicken soup:
The difference between the two bowls is on the ingredients, and the soup base is the same.
There are a few pieces of barbecued pork and a raw shellfish.

The soup of the soup is the soup of the Wangshuang soup head (chicken soup+scallop), which is more like a novice level.
The concentration and taste will be a bit of itching for noodle friends who eat ramen. I wonder if there is a possibility of customized adjustment in the future?!

In terms of ramen, I will recommend the bowl of truffle, because the taste of the soup is also the part that is slightly insufficient.

The bowl of barbecued pork soup of the shellfish chicken soup is the shape of the flower, and the plate of this way has gradually begun to see it in Taiwan.
At present, there will be such a presence of Taipei Yinjia. In addition, there are many noodle friends who have many noodle pool points in this community.

Because the ingredients are presented by the original flavor, the overall is the soup as the main axis.

After eating it myself, I will choose to dip the noodles next time. The memory point of the last time is better than ramen.",False

"位於三井附近巷內的餐酒麵食館，外觀看起來讓人有法式餐廳的感覺，店內融合了日式與現代風，燈光明亮適中，吧檯位置面對開放式廚房，可以看師傅料理，但難免有鍋碗瓢盆的撞擊聲，想安靜聊天可以坐後方位子。
料理部分，價格高貴不貴，而且料理品質不會因為價格而屈就，像這次點的干貝舒肥雞拉麵，融合法式的高級典雅與日式的傳統韻味，干貝上甚至使用算大量的黑松露醬，讓微炙燒干貝整個口感提升，黑松露的香氣餘韻也在口腔瀰漫，讓清湯的層次更上一層，舒肥雞也使用白蘭地做料理，清甜的酒香與拉麵融為一體，溫泉蛋的部分就普通，有點過熟了，整體來說份量足夠，點沾麵配上酸甜適中的配醬，吃完再加湯來讓微飽的胃做最後的點綴。

In the cooking section, the price is noble and not expensive, and the quality of the cooking will not be bold by the price.

"雖然已暫停營業,但還是請店家要注意食安, 我們是在林口吃了你們的燒肉店覺得不錯,經過店員介紹來嚐嚐你們的拉麵,  但是滿心期待地去, 卻拉肚子水洩回來!!
差不多兩周前的中午用餐,
1.很熱又悶,空間狹小加上空調不足,一面吃一面覺得呼吸困難.問了店員有沒有開冷氣? 回覆:我們今天抽風抽比較久,所以比較熱.
抽風如果是每天例行公事, 那用餐的客人請避開, 真的吃的很不舒服.吃完到店門口還沒出門又一陣熱浪襲來.原來玄關處是挑高樓層落地玻璃, .太陽一曬就熱,風管也在頭頂玄關狹縫中,所有的熱源都在門口
2. 吃完回家到了下午, 開始腹痛, 拉希,  到晚上拉了3次, 以為把髒東西拉乾淨就沒事,  隔天變成拉希+胃痛, 甚麼東西都無法吃, 會痛,  晚上去看醫生, 拿了藥, 吃藥稍微好一點, 但為還是悶悶痛痛的,搞了快兩周.

回想當天,早上9點只吃了麥當勞早餐, 一切都好好地, 直到中午才來吃拉麵,  懷疑是麵裡的鮭魚卵有問題.  當天鮭魚卵吃起來是微溫,本來安慰自己那是因為放在熱麵上, 但是如果是有保鮮從冷藏拿出來, 吃起來應該還是偏涼的.而且我們沒有耽擱, 就開始食用了. 另外有可能的或許是干貝, 干貝差不多3分熟吧,  食材都不錯, 但就是食物的處理和保存還是請店家注意一下, 氣候越來越熱, 當天現場的溫度就已經很高了, 食材如果一直暴露在外面, 細菌很容易快速增長. 最近食安問題多, 幸好拉一拉, 胃絞痛個兩周也漸漸好轉. 但還是希望店家能夠多多注意, 不然你們燒肉店也有鮭魚卵飯. 我也不敢吃了. 以上幫我先生代PO","Although the business has been suspended, we still ask the store to pay attention to food safety. We felt that we had eaten your roasted meat shop at Linkou. After being introduced by the clerk, we tried your ramen, but he went to the water with expectations. ""
Summer meal almost two weeks ago,
1. It is very hot and stuffy. The space is small and the air conditioner is insufficient. It feels difficult to breathe on the one hand. I asked the clerk whether there was air -conditioning? Reply: We have a long storm today, so it is hotter.
If the wind is routine every day, the guests who dine should avoid it. It is really uncomfortable to eat. After eating the entrance of the store, there is no heat wave. Just heat, the air duct is also in the seam of the porch above the head, all the heat sources are at the door at the door

"想找家餐酒館約會，看到這家的評論說氣氛不錯食物好吃，所以前來用餐，以下是用餐體驗。
1.進去的時候感覺還不錯，造景也挺漂亮，結果進到座位區發現跟吧檯是兩個世界。吧台是昏黃溫暖的燈光，座位區是冰冷的白光，而且座位區旁邊的白牆多有發霉，相當的明顯（因為是晚上去，在燈光的差異和霉斑或髒污都更加明顯），多少破壞了用餐的氛圍。
2.食物的部分點了一份套餐，前菜燻鴨沙拉相當不錯，醬汁裡面加了芥末頗有點睛之意。
主餐蒜味蝦蝦很不錯吃，洋蔥蒜頭爆香，再加上黑胡椒，是很典型台灣人會喜歡的口味，主要是不會太鹹或味道太重，點讚。
副食換了松露干貝雞湯麵，雞湯的部分或說中日交融，或說不中不日，個人並不是這這麼喜愛，麵也是有種義大利麵跟拉麵混合的感覺，方形切面，偏硬，不是Q彈的口感，個人也是比較還好，這道菜跟上述兩道相比較為普通，而且雞湯這種帶中式（或日式）風格的湯頭，確實跟西餐套餐搭配起來顯得並不是這麼和諧。
另外單點了一道法式蝦蟹濃湯煲飯，整體還不錯，不過蟹的部分是蟹肉棒，稍嫌扣分。
3.原本是因為餐酒館想進來小酌一番，點了一壺Sangria（西班牙水果紅酒），喝起來沒什麼紅酒的味道，味道就淡淡甜甜的，也沒有氣泡感，水果部分好像也只有一些些蘋果跟檸檬，所以沒有豐富多樣的水果香氣與酸甜口感，酒體單薄，味道較為無聊，不太匹配其一壺900的身價。
另外，酒杯的部分品質較差，有種塑膠感，會有一種淡淡味道（個人以臭味來形容），品飲體驗不佳。
4.服務的部分可能因人手不足，外場時常處於無人能找的狀況，導致常常需要向吧台的內場人員揮手問話。

以上，總共三顆星，一顆扣環境，一顆扣酒，希望下次去吃能有改善🙏🙏🙏

PS.好像是寵物友善餐廳（？","I want to find a dining tavern to date, and I see this commented that the atmosphere is good and delicious, so come to dine. The following is the dining experience.
1. When I went in, I felt pretty good, and the landscape was pretty. As a result, I went to the seat area to find that the bar table was two worlds.The bar is a dim light, the seat area is cold white light, and the white wall next to the seat area is mostly moldy, which is quite obvious (because it is at night, the difference between the lights and the moldy spots or dirt are more obvious), how much is it? Destroy the atmosphere of the meal.
2. The food part ordered a package. The front dish smoked duck salad was pretty good, and the sauce was very eye -catching.
The main meal garlic shrimp is very good, the onion and garlic are fragrant, and the black pepper is a typical flavor that Taiwanese will like, mainly because it will not be too salty or too heavy, like it.
The non -staple food has changed the noodle noodles, parts of the chicken soup, or the blend of Sino -Japanese blending, or if it is not in the same day, individuals are not so favorite, and the noodles also have a feeling of spae and ramen. It is not the taste of the Q bomb, and the individual is also better. This dish is ordinary compared to the above two, and the soup with a Chinese -style style of chicken soup is indeed not so harmonious to match with the western dinner. Essence
In addition, I ordered a French shrimp and crab soup to cook rice. The overall is not bad, but the crab is crab meat stick, which is a little deducted.
3. Originally because the restaurant wanted to come in and drink it, ordered a pot of SANGRIA (Spanish fruits and wine). There was no taste of red wine, and the taste was light and sweet. Some apples and lemons are not rich in the aroma and sweet and sour taste of fruits. The wine is thin and the taste is boring. It does not match its worth of 900.
In addition, some of the wine glasses have poor quality, with a sense of plastic, and there will be a faint taste (personally described by odor), and the drinking experience is not good.
4. The service part may be in the case of insufficient manpower, and there is often a situation that no one can find outside the field, which often needs to wave to the internal staff of the bar.

Above, a total of three stars, one buckle environment, one buckle wine, I hope to eat next time

餐點每一道都很好吃，而且會一直想再回來吃。店面小，位置不多，一定要訂位。,"Every meal is delicious, and I will always want to come back to eat again.The store is small and the location is not much. Be sure to order.",False
"由店家的回覆能感覺到對客戶意見很重視，想針對今日透過外帶平台訂餐做出評論。 如果你在考慮外送並有開統一編號的需要，請考慮再三，在這裡出狀況店家可能不會幫你想辦法。
在訂單上標註要開統一編號，並且在下訂後一分鐘內即致電店家有此需求，電話內店家明確回覆了解此需求並承諾會處理，然而實際收到後卻依然沒有開統編，並且否認電話內承諾的事情，推說是平台的問題，也不願於當日換開發票，與平台互踢皮球。
我也曾實際造訪店內用餐 很棒的氛圍 對得起價格的美味，因為疫情不得已只能選擇外送，但是遇到問題不管是店家的問題還是平台的問題，消費者需要的是看到店家嘗試一起解決，而不是否認自己承諾的事情，或是推給平台。
誠心建議您要準備好應對這類問題，否則平台上發生的不愉快和矛盾有可能會影響到您長久累積的良好評價。","The response from the store can feel that they attach great importance to their opinions, and want to comment on ordering meals through the take -off platform today.If you are considering the delivery and uniform number, please consider it again and again. The store here may not help you find a way.
The unified number is marked on the order, and the store has this demand within one minute after ordering. The store in the phone clearly responds to understanding this demand and promised to deal with it. The promise promised on the phone was stated that it was a platform problem, and he was unwilling to change invoices on the same day and played the ball with the platform.
I have also actually visited the restaurant in the store. The great atmosphere is worthy of the deliciousness of the price, because the epidemic can only choose to deliver, but whether it is a problem or a platform problem, what consumers need is to see that the store tries to solve it together to solve it together , Instead of denying what you promise, or pushing to the platform.
Sincerely suggest that you should prepare such problems, otherwise the unpleasant and contradictions on the platform may affect your long -accumulated good evaluation.",False

我是一個很重視CP 值的人，這家店的CP 值中等，然而這家店我已經光顧第二次了，湯頭令人驚艷，麵吃起來很有彈性，不覺得其它拉麵店可以比的過這家，尤其那些號稱從日本來的名店，用餐環境很好很乾淨，但位子不多，份量不是那種吃粗飽的，也許它本來就不是那種路線，我覺得份量剛好。有時候台灣人吃飯喜歡看評價也是正常，怕踩到雷，通常評價中上是可以避免踩到雷，但不代表評價不高就不好，我很怕這家店之後來吃要排隊，至少現在還沒有太多人發現，最後我覺得很建議愛拉麵的人能來試試看或住附近的人，但如果之後人變多了，我就不會再來了，因為我不愛排隊。,"I am a person who attaches great importance to the CP value. The CP value of this shop is medium. However, I have patronized the second time. The soup is amazing, and the noodles are very flexible. After this one, especially those famous shops that come from Japan, the dining environment is very good and clean, but the seats are not much, and the portion is not the kind of full. Maybe it is not the kind of route. I think the portion is just right.Sometimes it ’s normal for Taiwanese people to eat evaluation. They are afraid of stepping on thunder. Generally, the evaluation can avoid stepping on the thunder, but it does not mean that the evaluation is not high. Not too many people have discovered it yet. In the end, I think people who are ramen can try or live or live, but if there are more people afterwards, I will not come again because I don't like to line up.",False
今天點松露干貝雞拉麵跟白蘭地鴨胸拉麵都非常好吃，跟一般常見的日式拉麵口味不一樣，味道更濃厚且多層次，一定會再訪把各種口味都吃一遍。,"Today, the fluffy dried shellfish ramen is very delicious and the Bailan Duck breast ramen is very delicious. It is different from the common Japanese -style ramen taste. The taste is stronger and more layered. You will definitely eat all kinds of flavors.",False
"為什麼家裡附近沒有這種店？
店家週邊好停車，環境優雅。
