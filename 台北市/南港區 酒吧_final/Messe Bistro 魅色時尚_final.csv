今天是在南港展覽館辦生技展，午餐在一樓找餐廳吃，因為是第一次來所以不清楚有什麼餐廳，摩斯漢堡滿了就往旁邊的餐廳用餐，因為這一間人比較少，在櫃檯看了好久才看到價目表，店家故意用很小的字寫價格，有很多人進來看了價格走掉之後店員還會翻白眼，而且製作餐點的店員沒有妥善的戴好口罩，服務的語氣也不佳，今天和家人總共點了三樣菜，德式香腸勉強過關，但是雞腿的肉很韌很硬，上面的皮用餐刀很難切，紅酒牛肉剁面的蔬菜吃起來跟知名美式賣場的冷凍蔬菜味道一樣，剁面像是揉好的麵團隨便亂捏丟到水中煮太久的感覺，牛肉勉強及格，撇除餐點的美味，我認為服務生的態度是最糟糕的，今天的用餐是三個年輕人和一位較年長的服務生，態度最糟糕的是那位短頭髮的服務生，希望各位顧客不要一時貪圖方便沒有先看評論再用餐，吃完會一肚子氣,"Today is a living technical exhibition at the Nangang Exhibition Hall. Lunch is to find a restaurant on the first floor. Because it is the first time, I don’t know what restaurant is there. Little, I saw the price list for a long time at the counter.

The German sausage barely passed the barrier, but the meat of the chicken legs was very tough and hard. The skin on it was difficult to cut. Like the frozen vegetables of the well -known American store, the chopped noodles seem to be frightened and thrown into the water for a long time. The beef barely passed and eliminated the deliciousness of the meal. I think the attitude of the waiter is the worst. Well, today’s dining is three young people and one older waiter.
