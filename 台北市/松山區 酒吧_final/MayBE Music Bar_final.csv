"剛好到附近辦事，意外發現的一間酒吧，辦完事忙完後就馬上來店光臨，感覺是經營很久的一家老店，裝潢雖說看起來有年紀，但不影響整體的觀感，燈光的部分比較暗沉，如果沒有仔細看，第一次來可能真的會沒發現是一間酒吧😅，發現是酒吧時真的很意外，覺得非常酷，且還有二樓露天位置，雖然還沒有上去看過，但是覺得非常特別，期待下次有機會能坐在二樓欣賞風景

之前有去過類似大家可以一起唱歌的酒吧，原本以為今天會有，但有可能是比較早到店裡，看其他評論寫貴店有卡拉ok可以唱，可惜從進門到離開都沒有看到卡拉ok歡唱，不知是不是自己搞錯了😆

酒吧內部可抽菸，音響播放的音樂也不會像其他酒吧音樂放過於大聲，店內環境也很乾淨，有單人的吧台位置，也有和三五好友一起來可以坐的開放式沙發區坐，店內的各種擺設也很非常特別，第一次來到像這樣喜歡的酒吧，真的會想來一次再來第二次

低消價格要求也不會過貴，原以為市區的酒吧，消費可能也很高，但意外的便宜，真的是非常的意外，且不會因為消費便宜就環境髒亂環境不好什麼的

第一次來，真的是大推沒失望～～～
非常推薦貴店，祝生意興隆㊗️㊗️🔥","Just when I went to work nearby, I was accidentally found a bar. After I finished my work, I came to the store immediately. It felt like an old shop that had been operating for a long time. Although the decoration looked old, it did not affect the overall perception. Shen, if you do n’t look closely, you may not be found to be a bar. It ’s really surprising when it was found that it was a bar, and there was still the open -air location on the second floor. Although I haven’t seen it before , But I feel very special. I look forward to the next time I have the opportunity to sit on the second floor to enjoy the scenery

I have been to a bar similar to everyone who can sing together. I originally thought that there would be today, but it may be that I will go to the store earlier. Watch other comments and write about Karaoke to sing. Unfortunately OK singing, I wonder if I made a mistake myself 😆 😆 😆 😆 😆 😆

The inside of the bar can smoke, the music played by the audio will not be loud like other bar music, and the environment in the store is very clean. There are single -person bar positions, and there are open sofa areas where you can sit with three or five friends. Various furnishings are also very special. For the first time I came to a bar that I like like this, I really want to come again and again

Low -disappearing price requirements will not be too expensive. Originally thought that the bars in the urban area may also be very high, but the accident is really surprising, and it will not be in a bad environment for consumption.
