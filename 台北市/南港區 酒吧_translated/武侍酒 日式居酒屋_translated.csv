"只能付現金，店內座位較擁擠建議訂位。
肥腸滿好吃的，串物的部分羊肉也不錯，但豬肉烤的太乾了，其餘的比較普通。炸牡蠣看起來有點營養不良，外皮不算酥脆不太合我的胃口，生蠔上來已經是常溫了有點被嚇到。","Only cash can be paid, and the seats in the store are more crowded.
The fat intestines are delicious, and some of the skewers are also good, but the pork is grilled too dry, and the rest is ordinary.Fried oysters look a bit malnourished.

照燒炒烏龍（牛）- NT$149 ⭐️ 4
照燒烏龍麵的鹹甜醬汁香氣誘人，但口味比較重。可惜的是，麵條的口感偏硬，少了些Q彈的口感。牛五花則又嫩又入味。

沖繩黑糖炸麻糬- NT$59 ⭐️ 4
外酥內軟的黑糖麻糬，內層軟嫩帶點綿密的感覺，也不黏牙。 黑糖味道剛剛好不會膩，是很棒的甜點。

柚子沙瓦- NT$119 ⭐️ 4.5

真澄金標 熱- NT$169 ⭐️ 4
溫熱的真澄金標，初味甜甜的還帶有青蘋果香，從甜到辛逐漸轉變，非常獨特！

"訂包廂座位可以坐八個人場內包廂有兩桌，但是我們在最後一桌對面就是廁所，感覺用餐感覺有點怪，有限時2小時，前面點完約過半小時才開始送餐，應該是尖峰時刻人一次湧入，座位感覺蠻擁擠，坐最裡面要移動上廁所的話，外面的人要先讓位！
點了Asahi 生啤有點偏苦，一杯139元，若人多酒量不錯，可以考慮選擇整瓶清酒，還算划算，整瓶1800ml大概2000多元，整理用餐還算Ok外場服務元，應對回應還算不錯，不然吃得有點趕，差點要換別的地方吃⋯後面訂位的取消所以可以繼續坐！","There are two tables in the box of eight people in the box, but we are the toilet opposite the last table. It feels a bit strange for meals. It is 2 hours after a limited time. When a person poured in at one time, the seat felt quite crowded.

Ordering asahi raw beer is a bit bitter, a cup of 139 yuan. If the amount of alcohol is good, you can consider choosing the whole bottle of sake, which is cost -effective.

餐點的選項還真不少，這次來用餐點的所有餐點，其口感和美味都不錯，可以感覺到不錯的烤功，及烹調的技巧和用心，推薦可以帶多位好友一起來邊用餐邊聊天。
移動到這裡交通也非常方便，距離捷運站及公車站都不會很遠，若有開車也能停在斜對面的「南港展覽館2館」的地下停車場。
若要說小小缺點就是，生意興隆所以用餐需提前一週以上訂位，且用餐時間只有2個小時喔！","The environment and space are fully used, and the layout of the Japanese rural izakaya is very good, and it has its own characteristics.

Move here is also very convenient. It is not far from the MRT station and bus station. If you drive, you can also stop at the underground parking lot of the ""Nangang Exhibition Hall 2"".

CP值很高，餐點也很美味的居酒屋，白天不用收服務費，店內氣氛非常讚。唯一缺點是出菜時機太沒居酒屋的常識，一般來說應該先上飲料，再上烤物，炸物等餐點，最後才是填飽肚子的飯糰呀，炒飯炒麵等等，沒想到竟然是兩大盤炒飯先上來，接著炒烏龍也上了，然後才出飲料，而且一杯一杯間隔很久...這點真的要改進一下唷！,"The CP value is very high and the meals are also delicious. There is no need to charge the service fee during the day. The atmosphere in the store is very good.The only disadvantage is that the timing of the dish is too common in izakaya.

烏龍麵點了照燒炒麵跟白醬兩種種類，炒烏龍搭配甜甜的照燒醬，已經收汁的牛肉肉片，非常入味～白醬像義大利麵那種奶油白醬，混合明太子👍🏻
串燒總而言之就是看到喜歡就點，無雷。但個人好喜歡雞心🤤🤤

生牛肉也不錯，但味道比較鹹（上面撒一堆七味粉）而且比較貴，cp值較低。

這天來的時候店內生意絡繹不絕，感覺蠻多客人是下班來小酌吃喝來放鬆一下的

近一年吃了蠻多串燒居酒屋，口味或品項上大同小異，但這間有讓我味蕾為之一亮的感覺
一開始先上桌的胡麻高麗菜是生菜冷盤，高麗菜鮮脆清甜，配上帶鹹度的胡麻醬很爽口好吃，餐間來個一片更解膩

照燒牛肉炒烏龍醬色濃郁，嘗起來甜口，很夠味，而其麵條讓我驚豔，很有Q勁，牛肉片也不柴
感覺店家炒功挺不錯的，當天也蠻多客人點炒飯，下次想試試

烤章魚串肉很實，這種最怕烤到太硬難以入口，但他們的還是保有汁水，大阪燒口味甜甜的，我個人更偏愛鹽烤，章魚的鮮味更明顯
還有少見的鹽燒白帶魚捲，白帶魚片串成圈，外皮帶點香酥，魚肉細緻鮮嫩，非常好吃，我們放了一下有點涼了也未有腥羶味

孜然羊肩排每片肉都有厚度，肉體偏瘦但吃起來口感不柴很恰好，大口吃肉的感覺我很喜歡

日本生蠔大約巴掌大，附上店家自製的酸甜醬汁與金桔，嚐來鮮美，一次吃三顆都不是問題吧

Q彈炒牛舌這道是店家限量料理，這個！我大推！必點！
一上桌熱氣騰騰超級香！牛舌Q脆，蔥鹽蒜等辛香料的香氣超迷人，讓人超想來碗白飯！

花生醬雞腿肉帶著顆粒的花生醬給的不手軟，很濃郁醇厚
大阪燒雞肉丸也是甜口的調味，但雞肉丸本身口感很不錯

和風生牛肉式居酒屋必點菜色吧！牛肉切麵色澤鮮紅誘人，搭配清爽帶點辛味的洋蔥絲與和風醬，很是美味

再來三款炸物
糯米椒牛肉捲炸串是牛肉片包裹糯米椒的炸成串淋上醬汁，雖是油炸物卻不膩，醬汁的鹹甜也剛好
酥嫩魚薯條酥脆好吃
甜點沖繩黑糖炸麻糬是個挺合適的收尾

而酒類店家的酒單蠻多種果實酒，我們點了紅紫蘇梅酒與紅葡萄柚酒，紅紫蘇梅紫蘇香氣酸酸甜甜，紅葡萄柚帶著獨有的微微苦味，兩款都不錯

個人認為是附近下班後小酌的上選

I feel that the store is very good, and there are many guests that day to order fried rice. I want to try it next time

Baked octopus skewers are very real. This kind of baked is too hard and difficult to import, but they still keep juice. Osaka is sweet and sweet. I personally prefer salt grilled.
There are also rare salt -roasted white belt rolls, leucorrhea fillets are skewed, the outer belt is a little crispy, the fish is delicate and tender, very delicious.

Each piece of cumin sheep shoulder is thick, the body is thin but the taste is not good, and the taste of meat is very good. I like to eat meat. I like it very much

Japanese oysters are about a big slap, attached to the shop's homemade sweet and sour sauce and kumquat, taste delicious, and it is not a problem to eat three at a time.

Q bouncing fried beef tongue This is a limited edition of the store, this!I push!Must order!
As soon as the table is hot, it is super fragrant!The aroma of the spices such as beef tongue is crispy, green onion, salt and garlic, etc., which makes people want to come to a bowl of white rice!

Peanut butter chicken leg meat is not soft, very rich and mellow
Osaka roasted chicken balls are also sweet flavors, but chicken balls itself tastes very good

Hefengsheng beef -style izakaya must be ordered!The color of the beef -cut surface is bright red and seductive, with the refreshing onion shreds and the wind sauce, which is very delicious

Three more fried objects
The glutinous rice pepper beef roll fried skewers are beef slices wrapped in glutinous rice pepper and fried into a skewers and drizzled with sauce. Although it is fried, it is not greasy.
Crispy fish fries are crispy and delicious

鮭魚炒飯相比鮭魚白醬烏龍麵來說偏淡，但洋蔥炒香和胡椒有提味到。柚香雞腿肉柚子醬很加分，蔥燒豬五花不會很油口感偏扎實，鹽蔥雞腿肉加上蔥的香氣很下飯雞腿肉也很嫩不会柴，安格斯牛肉串吃起來比較有韌性，但味道很足夠。推薦可以試試百香泡菜，酸甜的味道很解膩，整體來說是好吃的店，會推薦給朋友再來吃,"Salmon fried rice is lighter than the salmon white sauce oolong noodles, but the onion fried fragrance and pepper have flavor.Grapeframe chicken legs, grapefruit sauce is very bonus, green onion roasted pork flowers will not be very oily, salt, green onion chicken legs and green onion aroma are very tender and tender, and Angus beef skewers taste it.

第一次來這間店，食物的味道很不錯，串燒配上酒水，就是一個舒服，價位上雖然就跟一般居酒屋一樣不是說特別的便宜會有什麼優勢，但我確實有被老闆娘在認真拉生啤的樣子感動到，泡泡太厚，酒太少就再繼續補滿，一點都不馬虎，有時喝酒也就是一個fu，這次的消費真的讓人喝的很舒服！我給4.3顆星，推薦！,"For the first time to come to this shop, the food tastes very good. The skewers with wine are comfortable. Although the price is the same as that of ordinary izakaya, it is not particularly cheap. The appearance of La Sheng Beer was moved.
