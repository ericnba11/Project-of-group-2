第二次造訪，帶宜蘭來的閨蜜去走走，唯一美中不足的是...有一桌台灣人講話非常大聲，但與店家無關，馬的~你們走錯地方了吧...,"For the second visit, the girlfriend who brought Yilan came around. The only thing that was beautiful is ... there was a table of Taiwanese speaking very loudly, but it had nothing to do with the store."
"日本老闆開的日K
也算是條通地標之一了

相較於其他店這家更注重在whisky
還有調酒都很不錯
是個好地方週末總是大爆滿
外國客人非常多

章魚燒很好吃喔😉","Japanese boss's Japanese K
It can also be regarded as one of the landmarks

Compared to other stores, this is more focused on Whisky
And bartending is very good
It is a good place that is always full on weekends
There are many foreign guests

Octopus burning is delicious 😉"
今天1/26路過發現的意外驚喜，很推薦大家來！酒還不錯、店員很親切、食物也好吃，還可以免費唱卡拉ok超讚的🤣，最近剛好想找家教學日文，希望下次去可以挑戰唱日文歌！ …,"I am recommended by the accident that I found it by 1/26 today, and I recommend everyone to come!The wine is not bad, the clerk is very kind, and the food is delicious. You can also sing the karaoke of the karaoke free of charge. Recently, I just want to find a home for teaching Japanese. I hope that next time I go to challenge Japanese songs!Mowing"
純牛肉漢堡排 真的是日本的味道！生蠔🦪也很鮮甜！氣氛也很棒！老闆有日本職人精神～ 以後還會再來 …,Pure beef burger row is really the taste of Japan!Oysters are also very sweet!The atmosphere is also great!The boss has the spirit of Japanese staff ~ I will come again in the future ...
"更新一下，之後有再去一次還是沒改善，不知道老闆有看到客人的建議嗎？
—————-
可以唱日文歌喝酒，認識新朋友的好地方
唯一想反應的是廁所的馬桶，馬桶蓋會一直自己掉下來，對於有潔癖的人使用起來不太舒服，希望可以改善。","Update, I still did not improve again after I went. I wonder if the boss saw the advice of the guests?
————————
You can sing Japanese songs and drink, know the good place of new friends
The only thing that wants to reflect is the toilet of the toilet. The toilet lid will always fall. It is not comfortable to use it for people with cleanliness. I hope it can be improved."
第一次來日本酒吧🇯🇵很喜歡的氣氛好可愛☺️,The first time I came to the Japanese bar 的 I like the atmosphere very cute ☺️
"初訪，與原本只是抱持著來練習日文的心態來看看，
結果Bartender很可愛，也有練習到日文 章魚燒也好，價格也親民，還運氣很好遇到日本人的客人，聽他們聊天非常開心，
整體氣氛非常好，就算不會日文也沒關係","For the first visit, I just took a look at the mentality of practicing Japanese,
As a result, Bartender is very cute, and there are also practicing Japanese octopus burning, the price is also close to the people, and they are very lucky to meet Japanese guests. They are very happy to listen to them.
The overall atmosphere is very good."
詭異到不行，點兩杯shot跟我說剩一杯的量，是不想做生意還是幹嘛？ 而且點單瓶價格還可以跟一年前貴了一大截， 我最少要2025才會再來,"Weird, I ordered two cups of Shot to tell me the amount of one cup. Do you not want to do business or do it?And the price of ordering single bottle can be a lot more expensive a year ago. I need at least 2025 to come again."
"超喜歡的愛店，不但可以喝酒還能唱歌，真的很划算。
酒幾乎我喝過的沒有遇到雷的，都調的很剛好很順口，喜歡喝濃一點的還可以免費加濃，cp值很高♡
店員也都很友善，大家幾乎都會至少兩種語言，真的好厲害，很店員聊天真的好開心。","The super favorite shop can not only drink and sing, but it is really cost -effective.
I have n’t encountered a thunder that I have drank almost, all of which are very smooth. Those who like to drink can be more and more intense. The CP value is very high.
The clerks are also very friendly. Almost at least two languages ​​are all, it is really amazing. The clerk is really happy to chat."
氣氛很好，酒類不差，很不錯。,"The atmosphere is very good, the alcohol is not bad, it is very good."
"可以唱很多外語歌很棒，中英日韓，氣氛不錯。但食物待加強，酒超淡，無酒精的水果汁+蘇打也非常淡，低消假日ㄧ人500。去過幾間林森北路的吧，沒喝過像水的highball，店長看到留言後表達service recover 願意退錢，或是做一杯新的，負責的態度值得嘉許。但我們已經要離開，也的確是使用了這個場所，付錢是應該的。店家表示因為我們是第一次來，如果覺得味道有需要調整可以主動跟店員說。請參考
補：本來店家在當天就反應了，很加分，我第二天也從一星改三星，現在一個月後回應竟然說我們沒有點high ball ，你們酒真的淡到不會讓人醉啦，原來這麼想要一星","It is great to sing a lot of foreign language songs. Chinese, Britain, Japan and South Korea, the atmosphere is good.However, the food is to be strengthened, the wine is super lighter, and the alcohol -free fruit juice+soda is also very light.I have been to a few Linsen North Road, and I have never drank Highball, like water. After seeing the message, the store manager expressed his willingness to refund the money or make a new cup of responsible attitude.But we are already going to leave, and we do use this place, and it should be paid.The store said that because we came for the first time, if we feel that the taste is needed, we can take the initiative to tell the clerk.Please refer to
Make -up: Originally, the store responded on the same day, and it was very extra points. I also changed Samsung from one star the next day. Now the response now said that we did not order High Ball. Your wine is so lighter that it will not make people drunk. It turned out to be a star so much"
很開心的氛圍 店員很熱絡,"Very happy atmosphere, the clerk is very enthusiastic"
有日本人唱歌，有日K感覺還不錯，想純飲威士忌也有,"There are Japanese singing, and the day K feels good, and I want pure drink whiskey."
認真很多日本人，bartender中文也都講的很棒！第一次在酒吧點章魚燒也是蠻特別的（但口味跟日本大阪的很像，是軟軟的那種章魚燒）,"Many Japanese people, Bartender Chinese also speaks great!The first time in the bar to order octopus burning is also quite special (but the taste is very similar to the Japanese Osaka, it is a soft octopus roast)"
"我們是招財貓 不讓店員當薪水小偷
ps 調酒好好喝","We are a wealthy cat and not let the clerk be a salary thief
ps bartending and drinking"
"酒杯只要一空店員就不斷遞酒單
已經說暫時先不點
還是一直拿酒單來
聊天的時候不停被打擾也很尷尬
-
調酒味道很淡","As long as the wine glass is one empty clerk, he keeps paying the wine list
I have said it is temporarily not ordering
Still always get wine
It's embarrassing to be disturbed when chatting
-
The taste of bartender is very light"
滿新穎的體驗,Full of novel experience
"我是平日晚上去的，人比較沒有那麼多。不過氣氛還滿不錯的。
因為店員是日本人所以如果你是一個人，想去的話建議還是要有點日文的能力。","I went to the evening, and there were not so many people.But the atmosphere is still good.
Because the clerk is Japanese, if you are alone, it is recommended to have a little Japanese ability if you want to go."
"借個行充被罵ばか，店員也在笑。
好一個台日交流👍👍 …","The clerk was laughing by borrowing a line, and the clerk was laughing.
It's a day to communicate 日 ..."
適合跟陌生日本人練習日語的小店,Suitable for small shops that practice Japanese with strange Japanese
水煙很慢就算了，還沒有蓋子很難抽，跟店家反應為什麼另一桌的有，他說只有一個，然後也沒幫我們處理，以後絕對不會再來了,"Water smoke is very slow, even if there is no lid, it is difficult to smoke, reacting with the store why there is another table. He said that there is only one, and then I didn’t help us handle it. I will never come again."
章魚燒很好吃，氣氛不錯，已經在這邊認識很多朋友😆,The octopus is delicious and the atmosphere is good. I have met a lot of friends here.
"很好交朋友的地方
唱歌也可以唱的很過癮","Having a good place to make friends
Singing can also sing very enjoyable"
很棒，沒有煙味，英文歌比錢櫃好樂迪還多，雖然有低消但完全值得。,"It is great, there is no smell of smoke, and there are more English songs than Qian Cabing. Although there are low disappearances, it is completely worth it."
"氣氛好！可以放鬆心情喝酒的地方，
還能和日本來的朋友們練習會話","The atmosphere is good!You can relax the place where you drink,
You can also practice a conversation with friends from Japan"
酒好喝、老闆跟店員都很好聊、也可以唱歌，很棒的地方！,"The wine is delicious, the boss talks with the clerk, and can also sing, a great place!"
Bartender Naoki桑，很專業，很親切，不會說日文的臺灣朋友，也很歡迎喔！,"Bartender Naoki Sang, very professional, very kind, is very welcome to speak Japanese friends!"
這次點了有薑味的墨西哥驢子，順便唱了幾首歌，下個星期還會再去。,"This time, I ordered the ginger -flavored Mexican donkey, sang a few songs by the way, and will go again next week."
店員很親切,The clerk is very kind
"劇組收工後的好去處!…

"時隔許久來到林森北路，我感到很興奮！

同時，奇蹟在我經過的第二個地方發生了✨

這很有趣，因為日本社區彼此之間有著緊密的聯繫。

我會再來的~👍️","I came to Linsen North Road for a long time, and I felt very excited!

At the same time, the miracle happened in the second place I passed.

This is very interesting because the Japanese community has a close connection with each other.

I will come again ~ ️️"
"可以唱卡拉OK、玩飛鏢的酒吧。
除了雞尾酒等酒精飲料外，我們還有台灣很少見的威士忌。
如台日交流中提到的，有許多日本和台灣客戶會說日文。","You can sing karaoke and play darts.
In addition to cocktails and other alcoholic beverages, we also have a rare whiskey in Taiwan.
As mentioned in the Taiwan -Japan exchange, many Japanese and Taiwanese customers speak Japanese."
"如果你想在台北唱日式卡拉OK，強烈推薦。
我來這裡是因為台灣的KTV傷透了我的心！
可以唱日式卡拉OK，不收任何費用，也不收服務費，而且我覺得比該地區其他餐廳還便宜！","If you want to sing Japanese karaoke in Taipei, it is highly recommended.
I came here because KTV in Taiwan hurt my heart!
You can sing a Japanese -style karaoke, do not charge any fees, and do not charge the service fee, and I think it is cheaper than other restaurants in the area!"
"非常好的卡拉 OK 酒吧，工作人員非常友好。有飛鏢機，廁所乾淨

適合遊客。你可以用英語交流","Very good karaoke bar, the staff is very friendly.There is a dart machine, the toilet is clean

Suitable for tourists.You can communicate in English"
"店員很親切！
坐在櫃檯毫無壓力，甚至還可以唱卡拉OK。
但我有溝通障礙，所以無法進行良好的交談，這很遺憾。","The clerk is very kind!
Sitting at the counter is not stressful, and you can even sing karaoke.
But I have communication obstacles, so it is regrettable to have a good conversation."
"有日本員工的商店。非常友善。有一些台灣人喜歡日本，所以你可以享受它。

"我已經離開卡拉OK了。我使用的型號是JOYSOUND HyperJoy Wave，歌曲是去年1月才更新的，歌曲是全新的，歌曲沒有達到重點，很失望。

點了沙類水果酒。水果酒可以退，但是喝水還是值得的。

--

我去那裡唱卡拉OK，我使用的型號是JOYSOUND Wave，這是一個相當老的型號。歌曲數據去年1月就更新過，但沒有新歌，很失望。

我點了一杯酸味水果利口酒。 水果利口酒很好，但酸味酒的味道幾乎像水，而且很稀。","I have left the karaoke.The model I used was Joysound HyperJoy Wave. The song was updated only in January last year. The song was brand new. The song did not reach the focus and was disappointed.

Ordered sand fruit wine.Fruit wine can be retired, but drinking water is still worth it.

-

I go to sing karaoke there, the model I use is Joysound Wave, which is a fairly old model.The song data was updated in January last year, but there was no new song and disappointed.

I ordered a glass of sour fruit liquor.Fruit liquid wine is good, but the taste of sour wine is almost like water, and it is very sparse."
這是一家氣氛溫馨的酒吧，日本人和喜歡日本的台灣顧客自然融為一體。,This is a warm atmosphere. The Japanese and Taiwanese customers who like Japan naturally integrate them.
很棒的酒吧，有友好的員工和優質的日本威士忌👌🏼,"A great bar, friendly employees and high -quality Japanese whiskey 👌🏼"

工作人員是日本人，無線網路是免費的，這對於獨自旅行者的社交來說非常有用。我打了一輛計程車，但很難到達那裡。這家餐廳周圍有很多日本餐廳，所以問路很有幫助。,"The staff is Japanese, and the wireless network is free, which is very useful for the social interaction of travelers alone.I took a taxi, but it was difficult to get there.There are many Japanese restaurants around this restaurant, so asking for help is very helpful."
來酒吧的主要是日本人，但你可以在他們的櫃檯保留自己的酒，工作人員很細心。,"It is mainly Japanese who come to the bar, but you can keep your wine at their counter. The staff is very careful."
"我是應店主的邀請臨時過來的，但與當地人的互動也很多，光看也很享受！
去異國他鄉和不認識的人喝酒是一件很有趣的事。

日本和台灣有各種各樣的酒。除了日本威士忌、高球威士忌、啤酒之外，還可以試試台灣啤酒、噶瑪蘭等台灣經典。

另一方面，零食是乾的，所以在走之前先放點東西進肚子裡可能是個好主意。","I came over at the invitation of the shopkeeper, but I interacted with the locals a lot, and I enjoyed it very much!
It is interesting to go to foreign countries and drink alcohol who do not know.

There are various wines in Japan and Taiwan.In addition to Japanese whiskey, high -ball whiskey, beer, you can also try Taiwanese classics such as Taiwan beer and Karmaland.

On the other hand, snacks are dry, so it may be a good idea to put something into the stomach before leaving."
"這是一個非常舒適的地方。
我以後會回來的！","This is a very comfortable place.
I'll come back later!"
"我聽得懂日語。
您可以唱卡拉 OK、水煙和飛鏢。
工作日的清晨和工作日相對來說比較空。
可以學到很多關於台灣的知識，所以我想這是一家你在旅行或出差時會想去的餐廳😀 免費自備食物！","I can understand Japanese.
You can sing karaoke, water smoke and darts.
Early morning and working days on working days are relatively empty.

When I drank quickly, the boss spoke to me.
Sure enough, exchange
There is a girl in front of the counter
Not a girl bar
This is a social bar 交
This is a good shop"
實習生聚會的地方。與名字相反，你將無法在這裡與台灣人互動。旅居台灣的日本年輕人的聚集地。對於當地人來說這可能不錯，但對於遊客來說卻不是一個舒適的地方。服務不太好，不乾淨（廁所有點味道），而且價格也不便宜。所以我覺得沒必要強迫自己去。,"Where intern gatherings.Contrary to the name, you will not be able to interact with Taiwanese here.The gathering place of Japanese young people living in Taiwan.This may be good for locals, but it is not a comfortable place for tourists.The service is not very good, it is not clean (the toilet tastes), and the price is not cheap.So I don't think it is necessary to force yourself."

"老闆和員工都是日本人，當地的顧客都是日本人帶進來的，也是台北年輕人常去的地方。
對於老外籍人士來說可能不太舒服哈哈","Boss and employees are Japanese, and local customers are brought in Japanese, and they are also often gone between young people in Taipei.
It may not be comfortable for foreigners haha ​​haha"
日本威士忌的精選！,Selection of Japanese whiskey!
我們點了一些古巴自由酒和一杯烏龍桃子雞尾酒，它們的水分足夠多，我們詢問工作人員是否忘記在裡面放酒精。  我的朋友去了酒保，被嘲笑了！ 很水很水很水的雞尾酒，還是不要去吧。,"We ordered some Cuban free wine and a glass of oolong peach cocktails. They have enough water. We asked the staff if they forgot to put alcohol inside.My friend went to the bartender and was laughed at!Cocktails with very water and very water, don't go."
"這是一家無論是長期居住者還是遊客都可以享受飲酒的酒吧。
即使你獨自一人，也能很快與顧客和員工成為朋友。","This is a bar that can enjoy drinking whether long -term residents and tourists can enjoy alcohol.
Even if you are alone, you can soon become friends with customers and employees."
唱卡拉 OK 的好地方~~還有很棒的員工！,Singing karaoke a good place ~~ There are also great employees!
是讓人放鬆的店。知道工作人員精通日語和台灣語，我感到很安心。而且它也很便宜。請去嘗試一次。,"It is a relaxed shop.Knowing that the staff is proficient in Japanese and Taiwanese, I feel at ease.And it is also very cheap.Please try it once."
我交了一個好朋友！ ！ ！ ！就像歌舞伎町一樣，周圍的人都說日語，所以要小心。,"I made a good friend!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionJust like Kabukicho, people around you speak Japanese, so be careful."
氣氛真的很好,The atmosphere is really good
