"對喔，這個就是酒吧門口，沒騙你們，是真的唷，這一間位於台北的一間隱世酒吧，裡面是佈滿一個個🐝蜂巢的天花，超壯觀，酒吧分開兩層，地面是可以聚餐的，而地下室就是🧡Nest琥珀蜂巢酒吧💛，這個區域是預約制，每位$1580，價格含兩杯原創雞尾酒，一杯1QTI三星認證如果紅茶和一份蜂巢香料雞肉瓦片，大概有兩個時間可以選擇，要留意他們的營業時間唷

裏面真的是超美，職員會為你詳細講解每一杯雞尾酒成份，來源，即場調製，其中一杯較為特別的，我也忘記了名字，他是以紅酒杯奉上，淡黃色，面層有三點，味道特別，有幾種香氣夾雜着，喝下去不是很甜，有點開胃感，值得推薦🙌🏻🙌🏻

因為剛剛到步，飛機延誤了，所以我們比原定時間遲了大概差不多1小時，他們很好，讓我們坐多一會，雖然比較匆忙，但這裏的確是一個靜靜品酒的好地方👍🏻","Yes, this is the door of the bar. I didn't lie to you. It was true. This hidden bars located in Taipei were covered with honeycomb smallpox. It can be dinner, and the basement is 🧡NEST Amber Hive Bar. This area is an appointment system, $ 1580 per person, and the price contains two cups of original cocktails. You can choose time, pay attention to their business hours

The inside is really super beautiful. The employees will explain in detail for you every cup of cocktail ingredients. Click, the taste is special, there are several aromas that are mixed, not very sweet, a bit appetizing, it is worth recommending 🙌🏻🙌🏻

Because the plane was delayed just when we arrived, we were about 1 hour later than the original time. They were very good. Let's sit more for a while. Although it is relatively hurried, it is indeed a good place for quiet wine. Bleak",False
"入口超隱密，第一次來找入口很有趣😄

不確定這是不是正確的地標但總之先留😂
NEST超酷，隱身在PUN樓下，裝潢很美很好拍。

令人驚艷的是bartender 英文很流利！同行友人只會英語，bartender 用很流利的英文解釋酒單👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

酒單設計富有巧思，調酒本身也很有水準，從頭驚艷到尾XDDDDD","The entrance is super hidden, it is interesting to come to the entrance for the first time 😄

Not sure if this is the right landmark, but in short, stay first
Nest is super cool, hidden downstairs in PUN, the decoration is very beautiful and easy to shoot.

It is amazing that Bartnder English is fluent in English!Candid friends can only English, Bartender explained the wine list in fluent English 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

The design of the wine list is ingenious, and the bartending itself is also very standard. From the beginning to the end XDDDDDD",False
"一間富有特色的小酒吧
以店中店形式存在
無餐點
但有提供團隊精心準備的自製下酒菜
酒單豐富有故事，環境極具設計感
好喝又好拍 小空間 隱密性強 安靜
需要提早訂位
不定時會推出新消費企劃
年前是用系列套餐形式
此次二訪是每人低消2杯調酒","A distinctive little bar
Exist in the form of a shop in the store
Fantastic meal
But there are self -made wine and vegetables that provide a team carefully
The wine list is rich and has a story, and the environment is very design
It's delicious and good to shoot small space hidden and quiet
Need to book early
New consumption plan will be launched from time to time
In the form of a series of packages a year ago
The second visit is to consume a low 2 glass of wine per person.",False
地下室小酒吧！調酒還好～店員不只會送錯人的酒，還會忘記你點了什麼,"The basement bars!Blooming is okay ~ The clerk will not only send the wrong wine, but also forget what you ordered",False
可以好好品嚐每杯調酒師的作品～環境也是外面酒吧所體驗不到的，很值得一試又再來的地方！,"You can taste the works of each cup of alcoholics ~ the environment is also not experienced by the bars outside, it is worth trying again!",False
酒吧是以蜂巢蜜蜂為主題的設計，共分地面及地庫兩層，地面的還可Walk in，至於地庫的則需要經Line訂座以及最低消費每位$800，而地面及地庫的裝修差異極大，本想一睹蜂巢為題的酒吧設計，但因為我們沒訂座故此只能坐地面樓層，亦只是在一間佈置平平的酒吧，並且消費了定價$400至$450的雞尾酒，覺得有點不值得，更有點詫異的是，因為朋友帶病不喝酒精飲品，問及侍應有沒有Mocktail，侍應竟然建議可選擇汽水或氣泡水，最後找一位高級點的職員方才解決問題，怎麼一位侍應連cocktail 跟 mocktail 的關係也不知道🤷,"The bar is designed with the theme of honeycomb bees. It is divided into two floors of the ground and the basement. The ground can also be WALK in. As for the basement, it needs to be reserved by LINE and the minimum consumption. The difference is very different. I wanted to see the design of the hive's title, but because we did not book a seat, we could only sit on the ground floor, just in a flat bar, and consumed the cocktails price of $ 400 to $ 450. I felt a bit a bit It's not worth it. What is even more surprising is that because friends don't drink alcoholic drinks with illness, ask the waiter if there is Mocktail, the waiter even suggested that you can choose soda or air bubbles, and finally find a senior staff member to solve the problem. The relationship between a waiter and Mocktail does not know 🤷",False
我們花了一段時間才從側巷找到入口——非常有趣的經歷。整體氛圍很棒，工作人員很友好，並分享了很棒的建議。在專屬「巢」裡度過了一段美好時光，享用了一些招牌飲品。,"It took a while to find the entrance from the side alley -very interesting experience.The overall atmosphere is great, the staff is very friendly, and shared great suggestions.I spent a good time in the exclusive ""nest"" and enjoyed some signature drinks.",False
"沒有真正的食物菜單。
整體概念非常有趣；工作人員知識淵博，很樂意與之交談。對酒吧來說，這絕對是一次難忘的經驗；雞尾酒菜單確實經過深思熟慮，有些成分是「自製」的，而不是從商店購買的。入口處也為整個地方增添了一些變化。順便說一句，樓上有 PUN 和樓下的 Nest 是不同的。
不利的一面是：當我們到達時，花了超過 5 分鐘才找到我們的預訂。","There is no real food menu.
The overall concept is very interesting; the staff is knowledgeable and happy to talk to it.For the bar, this is definitely an unforgettable experience; the cocktail menu is indeed deeply considered, and some ingredients are ""self -made"" instead of purchased from the store.The entrance has also added some changes to the entire place.By the way, there is a different PUN and the Nest downstairs upstairs.
The unfavorable side is: When we arrived, it took more than 5 minutes to find our booking.",False
"飲料很有趣，有些太甜了，但總體來說非常好。內部非常壯觀。
工作人員也很友好和友善，只是當我向台北的現場音樂酒吧尋求建議時，一名工作人員有點傲慢。他說現場音樂酒吧跟他們不一樣所以不推薦😅😅","The drink is very interesting, it is too sweet, but it is very good overall.The interior is very spectacular.
The staff is also very friendly and friendly, but when I sought suggestions from the live music bar in Taipei, a staff member was a bit arrogant.He said that the on -site music bar is different from them, so it is not recommended 😅😅",False
最好的菜單和食材。如果你知道你就知道😊,"The best menu and ingredients.If you know you, you know 你",False
參觀完這家酒吧後，我們就能明白為什麼它被公認為亞洲最佳 50 家酒吧之一。他們不提供食物，但提供一系列令人驚嘆的獨特飲料，您在其他地方找不到。我們有一個 2 小時的時段，這更像是一個兩小時的體驗，這是我們旅行的一大亮點。我們的調酒師梅森和史蒂夫非常友好而且專業。休閒但經驗豐富。您選擇一種口味，然後選擇兩種不同的選擇，避免其他酒吧的決策疲勞，而不僅僅是選擇“經典”。強烈推薦這種體驗。,"After visiting this bar, we can understand why it is recognized as one of the 50 best bars in Asia.They do not provide food, but provide a series of amazing unique drinks, you can't find it elsewhere.We have 2 hours, which is more like a two -hour experience, which is a highlight of our travel.Our bartenders Mason and Steve are very friendly and professional.Leisure but experience.You choose a taste, and then choose two different options to avoid the fatigue fatigue of other bars, not just choosing ""classic"".Strongly recommend this experience.",False
