朋友推薦小後苑用餐說餐點很好吃，真的有驚艷到我。餐點精緻不油不鹹味道剛好，椒麻豬腳大推，剝皮辣椒冰花煎餃直接吃兩盤，經典滷肉飯也是兩碗起跳，牛小排也很好吃，值得我們遠從高雄來吃。,"My friend recommends that Xiaoyuyuan meals and say that the meal is delicious, and it is really amazing.The meal is exquisite, oily, not salty, and the taste is just right. The pepper hemp pig's feet are pushed, peeling pepper ice flower fried dumplings directly to eat two plates, the classic braised pork rice is also two bowls of jump, the cow Xiao chow is also delicious, it is worthy of us from Kaohsiung to come from Kaohsiung eat."
餐點偏貴、份量偏少，最驚豔的是藤椒肥牛粒，骰子牛咬下去有湯汁，中午只有我們一桌，是看呱吉推薦來的，口味一般般，可能當天主廚狀況不好，下次想去春大直的朧粤。,"The meal is too expensive and the portion is small. The most amazing thing is the fatty beef granules of vine pepper. The dice beef bites the soup. At noon, there is only one table. It's not good, next time I want to go to Chun Dazhi."
"跟先生一人點了3杯總共6杯，第一輪是high ball、第二輪是花草調酒，很訝異花草調酒是預調好的酒加裝飾這樣的呈現方式(個人喜好問題)，可以理解店家定位難免需要配合來客，不過出乎意料的好喝，最後點經典調酒bee's knees、daiquiri，很謝謝戴眼鏡的bartender(忘記問名字)將店內的琴酒都拿出來介紹也謝謝他的推薦，在外面很常踩雷的bee's knees 調的非常好喝也喝得出該支琴酒的特色，daiquiri很標準爽口。
食物很好吃，起司燻肉盤的醬很特別提升起司跟火腿們的味覺體驗。
只可惜我本人對威士忌比較扛不住，不然真的很想試試小後苑的威士忌，但以一間威士忌酒吧其他基酒的調酒也能做的如此出色真的很讓人驚喜☺️不喝威士忌的也很適合來～
*只顧喝酒後來都沒拍酒的照片🫠","I ordered 3 cups and 6 cups with my husband. The first round is High Ball, and the second round is flower and grass mixing. You can understand that the positioning of the store will inevitably need to cooperate with the guests, but it is unexpectedly delicious. Finally, order the classic bartending Bee's Knees and Daiquiri. Thank you Bartender wearing glasses (forgot to ask the name) to introduce the piano wine in the shop. Thank you Recommendations, Bee's Knees, who often stepped on the mine, is very delicious and can drink the characteristics of the piano wine. Daiquiri is standard and refreshing.
The food is delicious, and the sauce of the cheese smoked meat plate is particularly enhanced the taste experience of cheese and ham.
Unfortunately, I can't hold it more about whiskey, otherwise I really want to try the whiskey of Xiaoyouyuan, but it can be made so well with the bartending of other base wines in a whiskey bar. Drinking whiskey is also very suitable ~
*I only care about the photos of drinking after drinking alcohol 🫠"

上次來的時候是五月第一次來，後來還很想念牛肉炒泡麵，所以今天又再來一次，今天依然點了牛肉炒泡麵非常好吃，麵很有嚼勁，還點了生蠔雖然不會心，但是也沒有甜味，他用的是日本厚岸生蠔。剝皮辣椒煎餃也很好吃，海膽珍珠塔也很不錯,只是當天的服務有點不太滿意，九點過後餐廳的燈會關的比較暗，然後就很容易叫不到服務生,叫好幾次都沒人聽到。

今天第一次和小後苑大直店，之前一直想預約信義店的位子，完全預約不到，要注意兩家小後苑的菜單完全是不同的。今天先來大直分店用餐試看看，來用餐可以停在英迪格飯店的停車場，走出來小後苑的入口在在1樓的外面，燈光好氣氛佳東西也好吃，有機會會再度光臨。","20240613
The first time I came in May, I also missed beef fried noodles, so I came again today. Today, I still ordered beef fried noodles. The noodles are very chewy. Although he doesn't know, he has no sweetness. He uses Japanese Humano oysters.Peeling pepper fried dumplings is also delicious, and the sea urchin pearl tower is also very good, but the service of the day is a bit unsatisfactory. After nine o'clock, the restaurant's lantern meeting is relatively dark, and then it is easy to call the waiter. No one hears it.
20240515
Today, I was the first time with Xiaoshouyuan, and I had always wanted to make an appointment for the seat of Xinyi Store. It was completely impossible to make an appointment. It should be noted that the menu of the two Xiaoshouyuan is completely different.Today, come to Da Zhi store for a meal and try it. When you come to dinner, you can stop at the parking lot of the Ingeg Hotel. When you come out of the entrance of Xiaoshouyuan, the entrance of the small Houyuan is outside the first floor. The lights are good. Come."

牛排淡而無味，完全沒有加分的效果，整體表現以泡麵的醬香為主，普。

👉 椒麻豬腳：
有點像乾鍋的東東，以豬腳蹄為主，椒麻的辣感很低，豬腳肥而不膩口。不錯。","👉 Braised meat rice:

"吃三道菜要花1-1.5個小時（薯條、煎餃、豬腳）
第一次40分時候反應
說是餐期出餐比較久，再五分鐘就上完了？
真的不是漏單嗎？餐期久可以體諒，外場點餐或送完單時，就應該提醒客人了
揮手也沒有人要來服務、單價也不低 客人入店水杯也要自己討？反應菜慢也只會傻傻說向上反應、又再等很久也沒人關心？不覺得客人桌上沒東西吃很奇怪嗎？
最後結帳請問這一欄是服務費嗎？都來這裡吃飯會在意那10%，是好奇到底被服務了什麼？真的感受不出來^_^

服務生：「喔…那要載具統編嗎？」
謝謝你們真的好幽默！👍

除非很有耐心、脾氣很好，不然不要來～真的不要來～會被氣死，馬上出來吃金色三麥，我打字前剛送單，打到這邊全都上完了，大家也都很親切、反應很敏捷","It takes 1-1.5 hours to eat three dishes (fries, fried dumplings, pig feet)
The first 40 -time response
It is said that it is a long time for meals during meals, and it is over in five minutes?
Isn't it really a leak?You can be considerate for a long time. When ordering or finishing order in the field, you should remind the guests
No one wants to serve, and the unit price is not low. Guests have to ask for a while to enter the store?The response dish will only say that it will be stupidly said upward, and no one cares about it for a long time?Don't you think it's strange to eat nothing on the table?
Is this column at the last checkout?When you come here to eat here, you will care about the 10%. What are you curious about being served?I really can't feel it^_^

Waiting: ""Oh ... Is that the vehicle is unified?""
Thank you, you are really humorous!Bleak

Unless you are patient and have a good temper, do n’t come ~ Do n’t come ~ I will be killed, and I will come out to eat golden three wheat immediately. I just sent the bill before I typed. , The response is very agile"
等上菜快一個小時，看服務生的樣子很像漏單，回應我們說今天廚房很忙會慢一點，也沒有其它表示。 老實說這個價位的餐廳，這種出餐速度跟服務真的不值得，調酒也沒有很好喝。最後結帳還照收服務費，跟櫃台反應才拉掉，建議老闆好好改進一下，不然真的不想來。,"After the food is almost an hour, the waiter looks like a missing list. In response to us, we said that the kitchen is busy today and there will be no other representation.To be honest, the restaurant at this price is really not worth the speed and service, and the bartending is not very delicious.Finally, the service fee was collected, and the response to the counter was pulled out. It is recommended that the boss improve it well, otherwise you really don't want to come."
"店內氛圍不錯
適合約會的地方
不過餐點好貴
避風塘花椰菜跟炸雞非常吃不懂！
餐點沒有令人驚艷，就一般台式料理/小吃，擺盤吸睛啦
無酒精飲料意外地還不錯
總結來說我家巷口最優","The atmosphere in the store is good
Suitable for dating
But the meal is so expensive
Gaolin and fried chicken are very unable to understand!
The meal is not amazing, just like desktop dishes/snacks, the plate is eye -catching
No alcoholic drink is not bad
In summary, my home is optimal"
"好吃好喝的餐酒館, CP值一般, 但沒有限時。

點了「松露薯條」蠻香蠻脆適合下酒。「怪味雞」醬吃起來像口水雞，雞用舒肥調理手法，也沒骨頭。「厚切牛排炒泡麵」微辣、好吃，也是下酒。「剝皮辣椒鮮肉煎餃」算是口味特殊，但無功無過。

點的每杯酒都很好喝，尤其是威士忌基底的。喝完隔天不會頭痛。

唯有餐點價格微微偏高這點比較扣分，其餘都很棒，推薦。","The delicious and delicious restaurant, the CP value is average, but there is no time.

I ordered the ""truffle fries"" to be very fragrant and crispy.The ""strange chicken"" sauce is like a saliva chicken.""Thick -cut bulls fried instant noodles"" are slightly spicy and delicious, and they are also wine.""Peeling pepper fresh meat fried dumplings"" is a special taste, but no contribution.

Each glass of wine is delicious, especially the whiskey base.There will be no headache after drinking.

Only the meal price is slightly higher. This is a comparison point, and the rest is great. It is recommended."
"餐點好吃、種類多調味好
酒也很好喝","The meals are delicious, and the types are more seasoning
Wine is also delicious"
什麼都很好，只是如果跟信義店比起來，還是偏愛信義店，因為威士忌的品種更豐富，明確看得到，容易選擇，小後苑真的是目前我覺得最完美的餐酒館,"Everything is good, but if compared with Xinyi store, it is still preferred by Xinyi stores, because the variety of whiskey is richer, it can be seen clearly, it is easy to choose, Xiaoshouyuan is really the most perfect dining tavern."
餐點等了1小時，跟店員反應也不以為意，看來這間店本很厚，已不顧服務品質，反正餐酒單價拉高，騙騙大直盤子就好,"After waiting for 1 hour, I didn't care about the response to the clerk. It seems that this store is very thick and regardless of service quality. Anyway, the unit price of meals is raised."
"香港朋友指定要到林一峰老師的小後苑。
點了炒泡麵、滷肉飯與威士忌炒飯，非常特別也很適合搭配酒，小菜點了豬腳，大推這道菜，有嚼勁好入口，吃了一塊會停不下來，鹹豬肉也很推薦。
台式料理與調酒更是讓香港友人大讚！
用餐氣氛愉快，一定還會帶朋友去光顧👍🏼","Hong Kong friends designated to go to the small posterior garden of Teacher Lin Yifeng.
Ordered frying instant noodles, braised pork rice and whiskey fried rice. It is very special and suitable for wine. The side dishes ordered the pig's feet, pushed this dish, chewy and chewy, and they could not stop after eating. Recommended.
Table dishes and bartending have praised Hong Kong friends!

"住附近第一次來，氣氛還不錯 也不吵
大部分都是來用餐 較為少數是來喝酒的～","For the first time in the nearby nearby, the atmosphere is not bad or noisy
Most of them are more a few to drink. They come to drink ~"
"餐點的部分我覺得很普通，松露薯條只有加一點松露，然後是配蕃茄醬，我覺得很不夠，如果是配松露醬沾，應該會比較好吃
煎餃也很普通，完全沒有多汁的感覺，但義大利麵還不錯，是硬麵，而且蝦子有去中間，滿加分的
酒的部分還行，也有提供無酒精的
最喜歡的應該是店內的氣氛，很放鬆，挺舒服的","I think the meal part is very ordinary. The truffle fans are only a little truffle, and then the tomato sauce. I think it is not enough. If it is stained with truffle sauce, it should be delicious
Fried dumplings are also very ordinary, there is no juicy feeling at all, but the pasta is not bad, it is hard, and the shrimp has to go to the middle, full points
The part of the wine is okay, and there are no alcoholics
The favorite is the atmosphere in the store, very relaxed and comfortable"
"結婚紀念日前一晚去住indigo，check in後到位於樓下的小後苑預約晚餐，竟然太夯到8點才有位置，且是Brandon接待幫我們預訂，可惜他六點就從這邊下班了，晚上沒機會喝到他調的酒。
八點來到這邊入住吧台位置，點了兩杯調酒與一些下酒菜，整體感覺非常滿意，酒好喝，餐點也好吃，通常以為酒吧的食物應該是馬馬虎虎，沒想到蠻美味的。我點了一杯Menu上沒有的調酒，調酒師還問我怎麼知道的，哈！沒想到這杯抱著一試的調酒真好喝，但由於這杯酒的原料缺貨，可能比較少見。調酒師還開了一瓶威士忌請我們shot，但我們第一次來酒吧不懂，竟然沒shot掉，回家想想後好像有點失禮，哈！真抱歉～
這次的初體驗讓我還會想再來！給讚👍","I went to Indigo one night before the wedding commemorative. After checking in, I went to Xiaoshouyuan downstairs to make an appointment for dinner. It was too much to have a place at 8 o'clock. It was Brandon's reception to help us book. Unfortunately Then, there was no chance to drink the wine he tuned at night.
I came here to stay here at the bar. I ordered two glasses of bartending and some wine dishes. The overall feeling was very satisfied, the wine was delicious, and the meals were delicious. Generally, the food in the bar should be sloppy. EssenceI ordered a cup of bartender on Menu. The bartender asked me how to know, ha!I did not expect that this cup of bartender was really delicious, but because the raw materials of this glass of wine were short of stock, it may be relatively rare.The bartender also opened a bottle of whiskey to ask us to take, but for the first time, we did not understand the bar, but we did n’t even go away. It seemed a bit rude when I went home and thought about it, ha!I'm sorry ~
This first experience made me want to come again!Praise 👍"
"提拉米蘇很特別，下層夾著仙草口感有層次感👍
氣氛及鹹食部分，則覺得信義區新光三越的小後苑比較好 …","Tiramisu is very special.
At the atmosphere and salty food, I feel that the small Houyuan of Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, Xinyi District is better ..."
"同行友人喜好威士忌，因此來到這裡聚餐，這裡是威士忌酒種類豐富的餐館，酒侍師會熱心又詳細介紹各式威士忌。
不喜歡威士忌的人也別擔心，這裡的餐點跟調酒也能讓你享受，麻辣豬腳、滷肉飯跟生魚片等，各式餐點都很美味，調酒價格不貴又好喝，大大推薦。","Candid friends like whiskey, so come here to dinner. This is a variety of restaurants with whiskey.
People who do n’t like whiskey do n’t worry. The meals and sobying here can also allow you to enjoy. Spicy pork feet, braised pork rice and raw fish slices, etc., all kinds of meals are delicious. Drink, greatly recommend."
"路過被裝潢美瘋，精心佈置像小花園般，色調、陽光、氣氛都太舒服了，深受吸引🥺

隨意點了幾道都十分喜歡，「沙拉迷霧森林」鴨胸入味迷人、擺盤乾冰動態氣韻美麗如森林裡的小溪流，喜歡這個用心的設計；「威士忌蛤蜊」上桌時還再優雅的噴了威士忌增香(湯汁果真酒味醇厚又鮮完全是精華)；「雞肉野菇松露鳥巢麵」濃郁醬汁細緻又綿密令人陶醉；而店家推薦饕客必點的「椒麻豬腳」更是讚不絕口！真的是必點！儘管這幾天餐餐臺菜桌菜，這盤豬腳依然驚豔，炸的很香卻Q彈不油膩、調味之好超級下酒，忍不住想拿起來啃著香香的吃，實在太銷魂了！！

佐餐酒選了杯島國柚花，好喜歡。是近期最喜歡的調酒。外觀很討喜、黃澄澄的好可愛，味道酸甜平衡、清爽解膩，有氣泡飲的感覺又不會像果汁，真的很推薦💛餐後想吃點甜的，沒想到當天剛好有不在菜單上的法式甜點拼盤(幸福到瘋掉)。法國甜點師傅親自端上桌為我們介紹，酒釀櫻桃派、早上剛烤好的可麗露、和抹茶烤布蕾(抹茶香明顯、濃郁順口飛上雲端超級好吃)，從沙拉到甜點、道道都很完美。

沒有用餐時間限制，小後苑是環境、餐點和服務都非常非常非常好的地方，有機會一定再訪！","Passing the decoration and crazy decoration, carefully arranged like a small garden, color, sunlight, and atmosphere are too comfortable.

I like it at will, I like it very much. The ""Sava Mist Forest"" duck breasts are charming, and the dynamic rhyme is beautiful as a small stream in the forest. I like this careless design; The whiskey is fragrant (the soup is really mellow and fresh and fresh); the rich sauce of ""chicken wild mushroom truffle bird noodles"" is delicate and dense; and the shopkeeper recommends the ""pepper hemp feet"" that must be ordered It's even more praised!It's really a must!Although the dining table dishes these days, the pig's feet are still amazing, but the fragrant is very fragrant but the Q bomb is not greasy. Ecstasy!Intersection

I chose the cup of island country pomelo flowers, I like it so much.It is the recent favorite bartending.The appearance is very pleasing, Huang Chengcheng is so cute, the taste is sweet and sour, refreshing and greasy, and the feeling of bubbles will not look like fruit juice. It is really recommended to eat sweet after meals. French dessert platter (happy to crazy).The French dessert master personally introduced to us, the winemaking cherry school, the grilled Corel, and the matcha grilled cloth (obvious matcha fragrance, the rich and the open mouth to the cloud is super delicious) It's perfect.

There is no meal time limit. Xiaolhou Garden is a very, very, very good place for the environment, meals, and services. If you have the opportunity, you must visit again!"
氣氛很好，環境優美，服務友善。然後海膽很好吃😳！煎餃冰花很脆以及外皮口感很好。椒麻豬腳很Q口味滿特別，然後滷肉飯蠻甜的，豬腳跟滷肉飯都蠻甜蠻油膩，兩個人吃下來有點太油膩。推薦點海膽和煎餃，下次想再試生魚片🤍,"The atmosphere is good, the environment is beautiful, and the service is friendly.Then the sea urchin is delicious!The fried dumplings are crispy and the outer skin feels good.The pepper pork feet are full of taste, and then the braised pork rice is quite sweet. The heels of the pork feet are very sweet and greasy, and the two are a bit too greasy.Recommend some sea urchin and fried dumplings, next time I want to try sashimi again 🤍"
必點的滷肉飯一定會一口接一口停不下來！雖然是肥肉居多的滷肉汁，配上蛋液卻是完全不膩口。怪味雞是舒肥雞肉配上川味醬也是一道非常上癮的開胃/下酒菜；和牛瀑布壽司雖然單價高，但可以細細品嚐出師傅的用心，每一口不同比例的海膽、魚卵、醋飯和和牛，都可以嚐到料理的層次，很值得點來和大家分享！,"The must -have braised pork rice will definitely not stop one by one!Although it is mostly fat, it is a halogen, with egg liquid, but it is not greasy.The strange chicken is a very addictive appetizer with a very addictive chicken with Sichuan flavor sauce; although the sushi sushi is high in unit price, you can taste the master's intentions. He can taste the level of cooking, which is worthwhile to share with you!"

"一個在大直的威士忌酒吧

點威士忌基本上沒有菜單，是告訴服務生你喜歡什麼樣的調性，他會去拿幾隻讓你聞聞看然後再選。
基本上一杯威士忌都是平均價格很高，一杯30ml的會賣外面瓶裝整瓶的五分之一價格，但是也正是到這裡才能品嚐到各種不同的威士忌。

餐點部分搭配主要是台菜，很多炒飯、炒泡麵、炸雞、餃子都非常好吃而且很配酒，這一點真的很讚

當然也有許多調酒，但應該就不會是這邊的主打

整體裝潢風格非常高端有格調，整個場子安靜不會到太吵，非常適合和朋友晚上來放鬆","A whiskey bar in Dazhi

There is basically no menu in order to tell the waiter what kind of tone you like. He will take a few to let you smell it and then choose again.
Basically, a cup of whiskey is the average price. A 30ml of 30ml sells one -fifth of the price of the whole bottle, but it is also here to taste a variety of different whiskeys.

The meal part is mainly Taiwanese dishes. Many fried rice, fried noodles, fried chicken, and dumplings are very delicious and very good. This is really good.

Of course there are many bartending, but it should not be the main theme here

"整體的氣氛很好，當天點餐我印象最深的是牛肉溫沙拉（如果你也喜歡芝麻葉的香氣應該就會愛）和炸豬腳（小小塊的有點焦香味，很優雅的就能吃得到膠質，口味偏重、完全是下酒菜），調酒的部分也都很好喝~~
鍋貼的話因為太多人推薦我也有點，但我個人覺得味道挺普通的，沒有特別驚艷的地方！","The overall atmosphere is very good. I impressed the deepest to order that day was the beef Windshara (if you also like the aroma of sesame leaves, you should love it) and fried pig feet (the small pieces are a bit scorching. Get glue, the taste is heavy, it is completely wine and vegetables), and the bartender part is also very delicious ~~
If I recommend too many people, it is a bit recommended, but I personally feel that it tastes quite ordinary and there is no particularly amazing place!"
"有如來到叢林裡，享受一場美食與酒的饗宴，大直店除了酒的選擇一樣多之外，多了很多不同的菜色，這次除了威士忌還試了好幾瓶這邊的紅酒，完全沒看過的勃艮第卻是意外的優秀，好喝！

食物選擇非常多樣化，各種菜餚都有，視覺上也很美觀，滷肉飯很好吃！（除了貴了點😂😂）","Just like to come to the jungle and enjoy a feast of food and wine. In addition to the same choice of wine, Dazhi store has a lot of different dishes. This time, in addition to whiskey, I tried several bottles of red wine on the side. Burgundy, which has not been seen, is unexpectedly excellent, delicious!

"朋友推薦過這間餐廳 但疫情的關係只點過一次外賣，今天路過便想著進去嚐嚐。 一進門就看到很多綠植 還有超大的吧檯。我們是中午來用餐人比較少 ，畢竟酒吧還是晚上來的人會多一點吧。雖說是酒吧但是菜色一點也不馬虎，今天點了炒泡麵 剝皮辣椒煎餃  香煎鱸魚 綠花椰菜 還有一杯 島國柚花調酒。
鱸魚跟花椰菜其實是幫小朋友點的。香煎鱸魚以為是煎一片魚排的那種 殊不知端上來一整隻站著的魚😍 被樣子驚艷到 而且旁邊搭配的椒鹽粉有wasabi的味道 很特別很好吃👍🏻
再來說剝皮辣椒煎餃 🥟皮稍微有點硬但內餡有獨特的香氣 像是香菜或者其他香料葉子 值得嘗試，搭配的沾醬竟然有東泉辣椒醬！連醬料都不馬虎👍🏻
最滿意的是那杯島國柚花調酒🍹  Gin跟柚子的香氣超搭，甜甜的柚香又有Gin酒的香氣 應該所有女生都會愛這杯。下次要再去嘗試其他的調酒🍸","Friends have recommended this restaurant, but the relationship between the epidemic is only once takeaway. Today I passed by and wanted to go in and try it.As soon as I entered the door, I saw a lot of green plants and a large bar.There are relatively few people who come to dine at noon. After all, there will be more people who come at night.Although it is a bar, the dishes are not sloppy at all. Today I ordered fried noodles peeling pepper and fried dumplings, fried sea bass green cauliflower, and a glass of island country pomelo flower bartender.
The sea bass and broccoli are actually clicked by children.The fried sea bass thought it was the kind of frying fish row.
Besides, peeling pepper fried dumplings are slightly hard, but the filling has unique aroma like coriander or other spice leaves. It is worth trying.Even the sauce is not sloppy
The most satisfied thing is that the aroma of the cup of island country pomelo flowers 🍹 GIN and grapefruit is super. The sweet grapefree aroma and the aroma of GIN wine should be all girls will love this cup.I will try other bartender again next time 🍸"
"初次透過朋友介紹來到這家店
氣氛+整潔度很棒棒 👍
但必需老實說無菜單日本料理""很空虛""
除了餐點量本身很少之外 口味也稱不上獨特
擺牌部分更是一片葉子簡單點綴 感覺沒用太多心思
老實說頗是失望 😞 有點對不起它的價格

豬腳 : 微酥脆口感最初吃好吃 但後面就會因肥覺得膩 (建議兩人共食)
炒泡麵 : 微焦香好吃之外 就是自家可炒出來的泡麵味
煎餃 : 請勿有過度高的期待 因只是單純的""煎""餃 🤣
唯一會想推薦給大家的就是那杯""玫瑰酒"" 酸酸甜甜很解膩","I came to this shop for the first time through a friend's introduction
Atmosphere+neatness is great
But it must be honestly said that the Japanese cuisine is ""very empty""
In addition to the meals itself, the taste is not unique.
The plate is a simple decoration of the leaf.
To be honest, it's disappointed. I'm a bit sorry for its price

Pig feet: The slightly crispy taste was delicious at first, but it would feel tired because of fat (it is recommended to eat together)
Fried instant noodles: In addition to the delicious fragrance, it is the taste of instant noodles that can be fried at home
Fried dumplings: Do not have too high expectations. Because it is just ""fried"" dumplings 🤣
The only thing I want to recommend to everyone is that cup of ""rose wine"" sour, sweet and sweet"
"很可惜，今天不是來喝威士忌的。
很幸運，今天吃到了好吃的食物。","Unfortunately, today I am not here to drink whiskey.
Fortunately, I ate delicious food today."
"為朋友慶生選擇的這家餐廳，有驚艷沒有令人失望！
特別驚艷的是食物的內容，有日式有西式有台式(還點了螺肉蒜湯），是非常不錯的fusion style餐點選擇!
剝皮辣椒鍋貼煎餃超級無底好吃！
紅白酒威士忌還有調酒的選擇相當的多，一定要選他的招牌下酒菜酒宮格！","This restaurant chosen for friends to celebrate his birthday is amazing and not disappointing!
It is particularly amazing that the content of the food. There are Japanese styles and western -style tablet (also ordered snail meat and garlic soup). It is a very good Fusion style meal selection!
Peeling pepper pot sticker fried dumplings are super bottomless!
Red and liquor whiskey also has a lot of choices for bartending. Be sure to choose his signature under the wine and wine palace!"
"氛圍不錯的店，不會為了食物來。據說whiskey 很多，但是因為我不怎麼喝，所以無法評價。

滷肉飯：他家最知名的是一道叫「滷肉飯」的菜。就是鬍鬚張說要漲價5元都被罵的很慘的滷肉飯。這裡賣250元一碗。如果不問價格，我覺得滷肉飯是好吃的。油膩油膩的，然後還有一顆金黃流質的蛋。還有配解膩的蘿蔔乾可以放進去。量是一般滷肉飯的2倍。

椒麻豬腳：據說是很受歡迎的一道菜。服務生推薦。不同於一般的魯豬腳，這個是烤豬腳。她把一整個的豬腳切成很多個小塊塊，優點就是很好咬不會讓你吃起來不優雅。沒什麼缺點但是也沒什麼驚艷的地方。

牛小排：唯一一個主餐。沒什麼可說的

熱美式：裝熱美式的杯子和歐洲下午茶常用的杯子比較像，但是沒有下午茶的杯子精緻。咖啡平平無奇，感覺就是一般的濃縮咖啡。

調酒：點了熱帶心情。原因是一共六款酒三款都沒有。是好喝的，但是裝酒的杯子實在太難看了。總覺得是在東南亞路邊的小酒吧用到的。看那個雕塑有讓我一總回到峇里島的感覺，真的是熱帶心情。

米果黑糖甜糕：這個蠻有趣的，外面脆脆的，裡面甜而不膩。是我會願意吃第二塊的甜點。","A shop with good atmosphere will not come for food.It is said that there are a lot of Whiskey, but because I don't drink much, I can't evaluate it.

Braised pork rice: The most well -known in his family is a dish called ""braised pork rice"".It is the tragic braised meat rice that is scolded by Hu Xuxing Zhang said that the price increases 5 yuan.A bowl of 250 yuan is sold here.If you don't ask the price, I think the braised pork rice is delicious.Granny and greasy, and then there is a golden liquid egg.There are also dry radishes to put it in.The amount is two times that of general braised pork rice.

Pepper pork feet: It is said to be a very popular dish.The waiter recommends.Different from ordinary Lu's feet, this is roasted pig's feet.She cut a whole pig's feet into many small pieces, and the advantage is that it is very good to bite and not make you not elegant.There are no shortcomings but there are no stunning places.

Niu Xiaopai: The only main meal.Nothing to say

Hot American style: It is more similar to that of hot American cups and European afternoon tea, but the cups without afternoon tea are exquisite.The coffee is flat, and it feels like ordinary concentrated coffee.

Bart -up: Order the tropical mood.The reason is that there are no three wines and three models.It is delicious, but the cup of wine is too ugly.I always feel that it is used on the bar on the side of the Southeast Asian road.It is really a tropical mood to see the sculpture that makes me always return to Bali.

Rice fruits brown sugar sweet cake: This is quite interesting, crispy outside, sweet and not greasy inside.I will be willing to eat the second piece of dessert."
"氣氛燈光裝潢絕對是頂級
店員很耐心介紹所有酒品品項
搭配起司
即便不是正餐用餐
過去喝杯威士忌搭配乳酪也是一大享受","Atmosphere lighting decoration is definitely the top
The clerk is patiently introduced all the wine items
Cheese
Even if it is not a meal
Drinking a cup of whiskey in the past is also a great enjoyment"
"餐點真的很有水準，食材很好
餐點完全不雷，生魚片品質極好，還有金箔
超級豪華的感觀
環境有法式餐廳的感覺，藏酒極多
從啤酒到紅酒🍷從平價好喝到高檔優雅的威士忌種類多到玲瑯滿目🥃
是可以喝到很多種高檔酒的好地方
對於喜歡品酒，又喝不多的人，是很棒的地方
會再回訪的好餐廳","The meal is really standardized, the ingredients are very good
The meal is completely unsightly, the quality of sashimi is very good, and there are gold foil
Super luxurious view
The environment has a French restaurant, and there are many Tibetan wines
From beer to red wine 价 from cheap and high -end and elegant whiskey, there are many types of whiskey to Linglang
It is a good place to drink many high -end wines
It is great for people who like to taste wine and drink not much

一到門口就覺得哇 應該價格滿高的
果然真的價格也是偏高 難怪連假還訂得到
因為餐廳真的都訂不到就只好想說來嚐嚐😆
先來說說飲品的部分 非常非常少無酒精的飲料
可是店內氣氛還不錯 滿適合約會的氛圍～
餐點的部分 香辣海味義麵好吃 麵是很義式的口感偏硬
但醬汁濃郁 但唯一缺點可能是份量偏少吧 4口就沒了的概念
再來是滷肉飯 點了兩份 但幫我們分成四碗 而且都很滿
我覺得很棒 可是不建議點 太油太油了 上面也只有肥肉跟皮
完完全全沒有一點點的碎肉 況且已經很油膩還搭配蛋黃
那口感完全不滑順 只讓嘴裡充滿著負擔的油膩🙃
煎餃則很普通 但餡料飽滿 原本想點剝皮辣椒口味但剛好沒有
而魷魚螺肉蒜 很好喝 湯很鮮甜 魷魚不硬很Q很軟嫩
一吃就知道很新鮮 螺肉倒是沒什麼味道可是裡面排骨很好吃肉很嫩
最最最不喜歡的來了 就是日本和牛 超級超級油膩
正常應該是會有點油膩沒錯 但是要有入口即化
完全沒有 只有油膩 像在吃肥肉的口感 這個價位完全不行
接下來椒麻豬腳 很推薦大家點 雖然肉的部分很少
可是他的皮不油膩很彈牙又很脆香 超級推薦必點！
季節時蔬高麗菜 普通到不能再普通 也沒什麼味道
最後生魚片很新鮮 滿划算的 推薦大家點👍🏻

As soon as I arrive at the door, I think wow should be full of price
Sure enough, the price is also high, no wonder even if you can get a holiday
Because the restaurant really can't order, I have to try to try it.
Let's talk about the drinking part of the drink very, very few alcoholic drinks
But the atmosphere in the store is not bad. The atmosphere suitable for dating ~
The delicious noodles of the spicy seafood in the meal are very rigid.
But the sauce is strong but the only disadvantage may be that the total amount is small.
Then there are two copies of braised pork rice, but it is very full for us to divide us into four bowls.
I think it's great, but it's not recommended to be too oily, too oily, but only fat and skin.
There is no a little bit at all, and it is already very greasy and it is matched with egg yolk.
That taste is not smooth at all, only the greasy in the mouth is full of burden 🙃
Fried dumplings are very ordinary, but the filling was full. Originally I wanted to peel the pepper flavor but it was just not
The squid snail meat is very delicious soup is very fresh and sweet squid is not hard, very soft and tender
As soon as you eat it, you know that the fresh snail meat has no taste, but the ribs inside are delicious and tender
The most dislike is that Japan and Niu are super greasy
Normally, it should be a bit greasy, but if you have the entrance, it will become
There is no greasy like eating fat. The price is not enough
Next, I recommend everyone to order everyone, although there are very few meat parts
But his skin is not greasy, elastic, and crispy and fragrant.
In the season, the vegetables of the vegetables are normal enough to be ordinary and there is no taste.
Finally, the sashimi is very fresh and cost -effective.
Come and try the atmosphere is not to eat meals. I suggest you order a little things and drink wine and vegetables.

"其實是為了瘋狂咖啡師Amis而來！才剛在網路上看到他的影片，隔天就飛奔而來，只為品嚐這杯不可思議的咖啡。真的也沒讓人失望，讓自己的味蕾重新定義咖啡，reset咖啡在腦海裡的風味，不苦不澀的豐富荔枝柳橙風味的巴拿馬藝妓咖啡炸裂我的味覺，華麗震撼的沖煮技法，不愧是瘋狂咖啡師Amis，全新化學概念的萃取咖啡沖煮方式，顛覆我對傳統咖啡的技法，真的太厲害了。

不過也意外發現這是威士忌大師林ㄧ峰老師開的店，餐點真的十分美味，我們第一次來，隨手點了秘密森林、烤鱸魚、松露蘑菇鳥巢意大利麵、當然最重要的Amis沖煮的巴拿馬藝妓咖啡，每一道都是滿滿的用心與職人精神融合的極緻呈現。不管是味覺、視覺、嗅覺、聽覺都令人滿足。愉快的享受這美好的周末時光。

非常推薦大家來這裡，威士忌餐酒吧的風格，有點出乎我意料之外的美味，一般這種店的料理都ㄧ般般，但是林ㄧ峰大師把日本料理、創新料理、新式調酒、咖啡等大師集結，整合出小後苑這個品牌，真的非同凡響。雖然菜單價位比較高ㄧ些，但是品嚐這些料理後都是超過菜單上的價值，下次會專程再訪，希望能試試米其林二星等級的日本料理，非常期待。

周三是咖啡日，推薦大家當然要去喝Amis老師的咖啡。","In fact, it is for the crazy barista AMIS!I just saw his video on the Internet, and ran the next day, just to taste the incredible coffee.It really didn't disappoint, let your taste buds redefine coffee, the flavor of RESET coffee in your mind, not bitter and unbelievable lychee, orange flavor of Panama Geisha coffee burst my taste, gorgeous and shocking brewing techniques It is indeed a crazy barista AMIS. The new chemical concept extraction coffee brewing method is really great to subvert my traditional coffee technique.

However, it was also unexpectedly discovered that this was a shop opened by the whiskey master Lin Xingfeng. The meal was really delicious. For the first time, we ordered the secret forest, grilled sea bass, truffle mushrooms and bird nests. Each of the Bacon Geisha Coffee is full of intention to integrate with the spirit of the staff.Whether it is taste, vision, smell, and hearing.Enjoy this beautiful weekend time happily.

It is recommended that everyone come here. The style of the whiskey dinner bar is a bit unexpected. Generally, the food of this kind of shop is like it, but Master Lin Feng takes Japanese cuisine, innovative dishes, new bartending, coffee coffee, coffee coffee Waiting for the master to gather and integrate the brand of Xiaolhouyuan, it is really extraordinary.Although the price of the menu is relatively high, after taste these dishes, it is more than the value on the menu. The next time I will make a special trip, I hope to try the Michelin two -star Japanese cuisine, I am looking forward to it.

Wednesday is the Coffee Day. Of course, everyone is recommended to drink the coffee of Teacher AMIS."

"位於大直的美麗華，旁邊有一個Indigo的飯店，一樓有一個Indigo的小後苑的餐廳，他是一家連鎖餐廳，如果你晚上想跟朋友吃一點點心或是小點，然後聊聊天，喝喝小酒，喝不同的啤酒啦、威士忌啊，是一個很適合的地方喔，那如果你想要配下酒菜，或許他的炒泡麵，還有鍋貼，這個簡單的低消，可以讓你坐在這邊享受他的氣氛跟聊天的感覺。

這次因為等一下還有事情，所以我點一杯latte，因為他這裡的咖啡啊、latte啊，是這裡低消最便宜，大概150的價位，然後配上我們買的威士忌紅酒搭配來喝，點一個炒泡麵，還有一個韓式炒泡麵，以及鍋貼，鍋貼煎起來非常圓，非常漂亮，再一個沙巴鮭魚頭，這樣一邊聊一邊吃，一邊享受這邊的風景跟他裡面的氣氛，那來這邊的話你可以在很多小路，各種不同的網美景點拍照，或是自己帶酒來付開瓶費也是非常棒的，或者喝喝啤酒，或者一些調酒，這也是非常好的享受。

市價如果跟米其林五星級的比起來當然還是有點落差，但是如果只是喝點小酒，吃吃小點，每一個他的菜色單價都是偏高的，他的一個鮭魚頭都落在五百八左右，那吃起來還是滿實在的，肉也很多，所以可以點個鮭魚頭，再一個小點心，然後在這邊跟朋友聊聊天，是一個滿棒的選擇。","Located in Dazhi Meihua, there is an Indigo restaurant next to it, and there is an Indigo small Houyuan restaurant on the first floor. He is a chain restaurant. , Drinking small wine, drinking different beer, whiskey, is a very suitable place, then if you want to match the wine, maybe his fried noodles, and pot stickers. You sit here and enjoy the feeling of chatting with his atmosphere.

This time, because there are still things, I order a glass of Latte, because his coffee and latte here are the cheapest low here, about 150, and then use the whiskey red wine we bought to drink, click on A frying instant noodle, as well as a Korean frying instant noodle, and the pot sticker. The pot stickers are very round and very beautiful. It is also a Sabah salmon head. If you come here, you can take pictures on many small paths, various different network beautiful attractions, or bring wine to pay for the bottle fee, or drink beer, or some bartender. This is also very good enjoy.

Of course, the market price is still a bit different from the five -star Michelin, but if it is just a little wine, eat a small point, the unit price of each of his dishes is high. One of his salmon heads fell in five hundred hundred About eight, it is still full of good food, and there are many meats, so you can order a salmon head, another snack, and then chat with friends here. It is a great choice."
相當不錯的整體體驗。從環境、服務、食物及酒體本身都非常具有水準。小後苑一直以來都是以高單價著稱，所呈現的體驗也是符合其水平。食物很好吃，不過請不要期待吃飽，分量很小。,"Quite good overall experience.The environment, service, food and wine are very standard.Xiaoshouyuan has always been known for its high unit price, and the experience presented is also in line with its level.The food is delicious, but please don't expect to be full, the weight is small."

餐酒館餐食份量偏少但還口味還不錯，其中煙燻牛排真的不錯，但標榜威士忌餐廳喝威士忌心裡要有準備，要請服務生推薦可是要三思，今天喝亞伯樂16年（不知道是不是限量版還是把亞伯樂當麥卡倫）30cc1200元大家可以參考一下，然後想喝個生啤酒，bar台看似非常多tap 事實上沒有生啤可以選真的太妙（只有瓶裝），個人是完全不想再訪,"The meal and tavern meals are small, but the taste is not bad. Among them, smoked steak is really good, but the whiskey restaurant is prepared to drink whiskey, and the waiter should recommend it. Is it a limited edition?

看起來超級美味，實際上也不錯吃，肉不會太肥，但要趁熱快吃，稍微放一下除了飯會變硬也有感覺比較油，就是上了趕快吃就對了！

單吃還好，配上醬料盤中間的東泉辣椒醬很好吃！冷了也好吃

小後苑辣雞翅（380）：
雞翅有附薯條，薯條就普普通通也不是重點，辣雞翅味道很夠肉也嫩，如果有點酒這道很值得點

蒜苗鹹豬肉（280）：
預期外點的一道，結果意外的好吃，蠻大一份算是四道中cp值比較高的，也是很適合配酒的一道

另外還有點一壺白茶（冰）（550）
配以上菜色很解膩，很清香也不會澀，但倒到最後一杯有茶渣

菜色整體來說還不錯吃，但cp值偏低","Lu meat rice (250):
It looks super delicious, and it is actually good. The meat will not be too fat, but you need to eat it while it is hot. It will feel more oily in addition to the hardness of the rice.

Peeling chili fresh meat fried dumplings (240):
It's okay to eat it alone. It is delicious with Dongquan chili sauce in the middle of the sauce plate!It's so cold if it is cold

Small Houyuan Spicy Chicken Wings (380):
Chicken wings are attached to fries, and the fries are not ordinary. The taste of spicy chicken wings is enough to be fleshy and tender.

Garlic seedlings salty pork (280):
It is expected that the external point is unexpectedly delicious. It is quite big.

In addition, there is a pot of white tea (ice) (550)

"服務生介紹威士忌相當詳細跟專業，試聞後再挑選，選到個人覺得相當好喝的Big Nose!
神仙草調酒就是甘草芭樂汁，太小杯了。
食物精緻，味道普通。
環境很棒，入座後想坐沙發區，服務生說被訂位了，結果用餐一個半小時沙發區都沒人呀（？
價格相當高，喝的不過癮可以去對面一鷺繼續喝🤣","The waiter introduces the whiskey is quite detailed and professional, and then choose after the trial. Select the BIG Nose that I think is quite delicious!
Fairy grass bartender is a licorice guava juice, too small.
Food is exquisite and ordinary.
The environment is great. After seating, he wants to take the sofa area. The waiter said that he had been ordered. As a result, there was no one for an hour and a half of the sofa area for a meal (?
The price is quite high."
溫馨餐館，食物頗有特色，酒類選擇多，服務人員也會依點的菜推薦酒。麻辣煎餃會讓人上癮，烤牛肉處理的非常好，鐵板不會讓牛肉冷點但也不容易烤過熟。提拉米蘇甜點則是讓我們有一個美好的結尾。,"Warm restaurants are quite distinctive, and there are many choices of alcohol, and the service staff will recommend wine according to the dishes.Spicy fried dumplings can make people addicted, grilled beef treatment is very good, iron plates will not make the beef cold but it is not easy to bake too much.Tiramisu desserts make us have a beautiful end."
"$1500無菜單日式料理，可以吃到美味又CP值高的12道菜！非常超值！不同於其他同價位餐廳，這裡上菜不用趕～慢慢吃～喝杯酒～和朋友好好的聊天！愜意享受～
謝謝小邱師傅手藝和Mike的親切服務～ 其他服務人員也都笑臉迎人，讓人倍感親切又放鬆。","$ 1500 Naked menu daily cooking, you can eat 12 dishes with delicious and high CP value!Very good value!Different from other restaurants at the same price, you don't need to catch the food here ~ Slowly eat ~ drink a glass of wine ~ chat with friends!Enjoy it ~
Thank you Xiao Qiu's friendly service and Mike's kind service ~ Other service staff also smiles with each other, making people feel kind and relaxed."
調酒好喝 環境氛圍很棒 調酒師介紹詳細 餐點更是一級棒👍 …,Blooming and delicious environment atmosphere is great bartender introduction Detailed meal is a first -class stick ...
"2023/4/20 三訪
天籟泡完湯回台北的宵夜首選。不是因為最好吃，只因價高有位。
餐食OK，調酒OK，氣氛不錯。只是冷氣好冷．．希望能為通常怕冷的女客準備小毛毯。","2023/4/20 three visit
The first choice for the supper after the Tianyan bubble soup.It's not because of the best, because there is a high price.
The meal is OK, the bartender is OK, and the atmosphere is good.It's just that air -conditioning is so cold...I hope to prepare small blankets for female guests who are usually afraid of cold."
"我認為這個地點最適合就是for打卡嚐鮮 或是你想要品嚐後苑老闆自己的包桶再來

食物 餐點上桌時大概冷了三成
酒 overpriced
服務 如果要酒就要舉起你的雙手或是大聲發出聲音😝 不然你盯著他們看 坐在那許久也不見得有人會主動過來探詢需求

不確定是人手不足 還是店家本來就是想呈現服務很chilled 的風格","I think this place is the most suitable place is for punching in the new or you want to taste the owner of the back of the back.

It was about 30 % cold when the food meal was on the table
Wine overpriced
If you want to wine, you need to lift your hands or make a loud voice. Otherwise, you stare at them to sit in that for a long time.

It's not sure whether it is inadequate or the store just wants to present the style of Chilled"
"裝潢整個無敵！！！
一進門就好似身處叢林深處
舒服到一個極致
氣氛絕對不在話下～～～

不管是用餐或小酌皆各有風味
就連餐具都有小細節！！
我想這代表著老闆超用心🤩

P.S.晚上周邊超好停車可以看完皇家影城再與另一半來享受一會兒～餐點部分就只能請用心品嚐啦","Invincible decoration!IntersectionIntersection
As soon as you enter the door, you seem to be in the jungle
Comfortable to the ultimate
The atmosphere is absolutely not there ~~~

Whether it is dining or drinking, each has its own flavor
Even tableware has small details!Intersection
I think this represents the boss super heart 🤩

P.S. You can park the Royal Studios and enjoy the other half after you stop the parking in the evening."
"酒品不說，因為沒話說。
餐點真的很優秀，滷肉飯拜託一定要吃。","The wine is not to say, because there is nothing to say.
The meal is really excellent, and the braised pork rice must eat."
"環境舒適，很漂亮，適合下午辦公趁機小酌的秘密基地。從領檯、帶位、介紹餐點、點酒每一個細節，工作人員都充滿笑容，熱情的介紹他們的餐點及威士忌，很有活力的地方，會再訪。
必點威士忌，上千款單一麥芽，三年都喝不完🤩 …","The environment is comfortable and beautiful, suitable for the secret base of the office in the afternoon.From the details of the collar, the position, the introduction of meals, and every detail of the wine, the staff is full of smiles, and enthusiastically introduces their meals and whiskey. It is very vibrant and will visit again.
You must order whiskey, thousands of single wheat buds, you can't drink it for three years ..."
"適合下班小酌
無酒精飲料調的好喝","Suitable for get off work
A good drink without alcoholic beverages"
威士忌酒名店，調酒也不錯，餐點稍微弱些，整體環境氛圍佳，適合約會小酌的好店，還會再訪！,"The whiskey restaurant, bartending is also good, the meal is slightly weaker, the overall environment atmosphere is good, it is suitable for good shops that are suitable for dating, and you will visit again!"

威士忌好喝，以星座為主旨來找也增添了一絲趣味性
餐點也好吃","2023/12

Friend gathering

The whiskey is delicious, and the main purpose of the constellation also adds a touch of fun
The meals are delicious"
"公司的歡送會，也是兩年疫情後很難得的公司聚餐
老闆點了超多的餐點，各種都想讓我們嚐試看看
一開始上來的沙拉「炙燒牛松露白蘭地溫沙拉」服務員拿出針筒大家都圍著拍照錄影，針筒裡就是白蘭地，很特別的上菜方式
「剝皮辣椒水餃」因為沒看菜單，盲吃之下很驚喜，不太擅長吃辣的紅心無法連續吃，但算是會推薦的特色料理
「椒麻豬腳」調味算重，畢竟是下酒料理，燉到軟Q的白肉簡直膠質滿滿，微辣的口感紅心也吃的很涮嘴
「鐵板牛戰斧」上菜大約三分熟，想加熱到更熟的熟度可以放到旁邊加熱的鐵板上，團體客很推薦點一份來分著吃
這次也難得了選了兩杯都是琴酒基底的調酒，個人更喜歡第二杯點的「神仙草」
那天餐點超多，主要挑出幾個推薦的品項給予用餐參考","The company’s farewell meeting is also a rare company dinner after two years of epidemic
The boss ordered a lot of meals, and all kinds of want to let us try to see
At the beginning, the salad ""Burning Niusong Lulu Bailan Wind Salad"" came out and took out the syringe.
""Peeling pepper dumplings"" because I did n’t watch the menu, I was surprised to eat it blindly. I ’m not good at eating spicy red hearts.
The ""pepper hemp pig's feet"" is heavy. After all, it is a cooking dish. The white meat that is stewed to the soft Q is full of glue.
""Iron Bannia Tomahawk"" is about three cooked food. If you want to heat it to more cooked, you can put it on the iron plate next to it.
This time, I also rarely chosen two cups of alcoholic bartender. I personally prefer the second cup of ""fairy grass"".
The meal was too much that day, and I mainly picked out a few recommended items for meals for reference"

"Nice place for having hand pouring coffee, coffee cocktails and all kinds of whisky. Also, they serve japanese cuisines, which is a special pairing with cocktails and whisky, must try.

在冬天的下午時段前來，陽光從大面落地窗灑入，相當舒適。有好喝的手沖咖啡和不少咖啡調酒能嘗試，威士忌的選擇一如往常的很足夠。新特色是以日料和調酒或威士忌做餐酒搭配，非常不錯，值得一試。","Nice Place for Haveing ​​Hand Pouring Coffee, Coffee Cocktails and All Kinds of Whisky. Also, They Serve Japanese Cuisines, Whit is a Special Payting with Cock tails and whisky, musty.

"今年老爺生日我們依然一起努力工作
錄影結束後來到攝影棚旁的小後苑

為我們服務的James 風趣幽默的說
他們每個人都是「行動的酒單」
滿滿整面牆各式各樣的威士忌🥃
卻能準確的推薦和說出每一隻不同的特色
不愧是台灣威士忌教父林一峰老師的酒吧

愛吃日料的我們可惜太晚才來🍣
師傅已經下班給了我們一定要再訪的理由

🌟炙燒牛松露白蘭地溫沙拉🥗
是我們最愛的一道
給雞蛋打白蘭地針實在太可愛💉
牛肉非常鮮嫩 裡面的炒菇好香🥩

還有一點點像烤肉的咖哩香

🌟羔羊佐馬告醬🍖
肉質很鮮嫩
吃到後面才發現蛋下面有綠色的馬告
他們還貼心幫我再烤更熟一些不見血

期待下次再來小酌一下☺️☺️☺️","We still work hard together this year's birthday

I didn’t order the wine list this time
All of the classic wine directly to Bartender"
"食物有創新的風味
調酒好喝、但是太淡。
當天喝到long island 淡淡的🤣
可能我們是酒鬼😂
回到台北還是會再去喝🥰","Food has an innovative flavor
The bartender is delicious, but too light.
Drinking Long Island on the same day 🤣 🤣 🤣
May
Back to Taipei, I still go to drink again 还是"
由於是第二攤過來續攤，肚子還很飽所以就沒另外再叫餐點了。Leo推薦的幾隻酒都很優秀，喜歡喝威士忌的人，在這邊可以找到很多有趣的選擇。,"Because it was the second stall to the renewal, the stomach was still full, so there was no other meal.Several wines recommended by Leo are excellent. Those who like to drink whiskey can find a lot of interesting choices here."

麻辣豬腳超級好吃又下酒～調酒品質超讚！食物無雷～～～下午就可以開喝推爆了！,Spicy pork feet are super delicious and wine ~ bartending quality is superb!Food without thunder ~~~ You can start drinking and exploding in the afternoon!
燈光好，氣氛佳。酒和吃的都有一定水準，口袋不深的不推薦來（紅白酒一瓶最少2500～3000），光餐食想要吃飽可能一個人要抓500上下的費用。,"Good lights and good atmosphere.Both wine and eating have a certain level. If the pocket is not deep, it is not recommended (a bottle of red and white wine at least 2500-3000). If you want to eat, you may catch 500 costs."
快速到訪試試，餐點好吃令人驚艷，酒點的不多，感覺中規中矩,"Try it quickly, the meal is delicious, the wine is not much, and it feels satisfactory."
"無酒精的鳳梨小黃瓜 NT250 => 口感甜甜鹹鹹蠻特別的

"威士忌牛肉炒飯好吃
日料頗有特色，至於好不好吃就見仁見智嚕
服務生對威士忌的專業沒話說","Vudel beef fried rice is delicious
The Japanese materials are quite distinctive.
The waiter has nothing to say about whiskey's professionalism"
餐點多元有日料也有滷肉飯和義大利麵，重點是威士忌很讚,"There are diverse meals, there are Japanese ingredients, as well as braised pork rice and pasta, the point is that whiskey is great"

"送上五星不用懷疑，各位一定要來喝Amis的咖啡！
這是我在外面從來都喝不到的味道，真的太讓人無法相信原來咖啡喝起來能如此順口！如此好喝

By the way整體服務一級棒 非常對得起他們的價位！
還有Branden看起來很辛苦哈哈！","Do not doubt five stars, you must come to drink AMIS coffee!
This is the taste that I can never drink outside. It is really impossible to believe that the original coffee can be so smooth!So delicious

The overall service of By The Way is very worthy of their price!

"日出之後大概半年沒喝到Amis的咖啡了
攪拌法針對風味的萃取
咖啡調酒風味與風味的結合
全台最神咖啡現在讓你看看🙏 …","I haven't drank AMIS's coffee after sunrise for about six months
The mixing method for the extraction of flavors
The combination of coffee bartending flavor and flavor
The most magical coffee in Taiwan now let you see 🙏 ..."
"首次光臨，氛圍不錯❤️
消毒確實、防疫細心。

可惜我正在準備體檢，
只能乖乖吃草而且不能飲酒🥲

等體檢完再好好過去喝一杯。","Live for the first time, the atmosphere is good ❤️
Disinfection is indeed, and epidemic prevention is detrimental.

Unfortunately I am preparing for a medical examination,
I can only eat grass obediently and not drink alcohol 🥲

After the medical examination is over, let's have a drink."
老實說，我蠻喜歡這間店....但是某幾天就會有活動硬要開車的人點酒精飲料，不知道是什麼白癡的規則....傻眼,"Honestly, I like this store ... but a few days will have activities that are active to drive alcoholic drinks. I don’t know what the rules of idiots are ...."
裝潢舒適，價格合理，Amis調酒跟咖啡都超強，據說還有超強的茶下次再來享受～～,"Comfortable decoration, reasonable price, AMIS bartending and coffee are super strong. It is said that there are super strong tea next time to enjoy ~~"
"滷肉飯拌辣椒醬，好吃!

因為上菜好慢，餓到血糖過低了，只好讓自己想開點，人早晚都要走的。,"Because the food was slow, the blood sugar was too low, so I had to let myself want to open it."
華麗的裝潢氣氛一流，美食配美酒，叢林與威士忌的結合，在大直新的好選擇。,"The gorgeous decoration atmosphere is first -class, the combination of food with wine, the combination of jungle and whiskey, in the new good choice of Dazhi."

"餐點好吃、裝潢舒服，從中午就營業到半夜，早上跟晚上有完全不同的感覺。這裡在用餐時間結合日料，坐在板前搭配不同風味的威士忌，是一個全新的體驗。

後院體系是我非常喜歡的餐酒館，每一間都非常有特色，最迷人的就是這裡的服務，每一個人都相當專業，有別一般酒吧，服務人員酒類知識相當專業，無論什麼酒類都受過專業訓練，很適合來品酒，跟他們聊聊，更深認識威士忌文化！

There are more than a thousand kinds of whiskey here to experience, different choices, suitable for those who like whiskey to try!"
氣氛佳，酒好喝，餐點好吃😋推,"The atmosphere is good, the wine is delicious, and the meals are delicious."

氣氛好，餐點有一定的水準，適合同事朋友小聚～,"The atmosphere is good, the meal has a certain level, suitable for colleagues and friends to gather ~"

I arrived at the scene at 7 o'clock just now that there was no seat, half of the inside!Instead of giving you a consumption of 20,000 in the box, three people will spend 20,000, and Taipei people are so open?Mowing"
"服務人員對酒的了解真的非常專業，又幽默
用餐氣氛很愉悅","The service staff is really professional and humorous

"咖啡師Amis 他的咖啡真的有高級飲品的感覺 很值得一喝
原本沒有點日料的打算 不過看到師傅對飯的處理 打算一試 不只是干貝 鮪魚的不同 醬料處理上也不一樣","The barista AMIS, his coffee really feels like a high -end drink, it is worth drinking
There is no plan to have some Japanese materials. I saw the master's treatment of rice. It was not just that the different sauces of scallops were different."

"威士忌🥃很細心的講解推薦
座位安排很適宜
讓人有放鬆的空間感跟裝潢 …","Whiskey 🥃 🥃 Recommended
The seat arrangement is very suitable
Makes a sense of relaxation and decoration ..."
酒是真的多！服務也很棒，專業！不過價錢也不便宜,"There are so much wine!The service is also great, professional!But the price is not cheap"
這裡的紅酒很好喝，調酒也很特別尤其是有一款在整個酒杯上都塗滿了梅子粉，喝起來酸酸甜甜的很不錯，值得嘗試。佐酒的餐食也不錯，還蠻推薦和好友喝酒暢談的地方👍,"The red wine here is delicious, and the bartending is also particularly specially painted with plum powder on the entire wine glass. It is sour and sweet, and it is worth trying.Zuojiu’s meal is also good, I am quite recommended to drink with my friends about drinking."
"環境舒適氣氛好

推薦魯肉飯！用了豬皮，豬腳，豬下巴，豬背油，豬五花五個部位！,"Recommended Lu meat rice!I used five parts of pork skin, pig feet, pork chin, pork back oil, and pork."
日式料理無菜單，很好吃食材很新鮮！大推！,"Japanese cuisine has no menu, very delicious ingredients and fresh!Push!"
威士忌種類非常多，服務人員介紹的非常詳細專業，但價格稍高，要來的人要先考慮一下荷包承受力，目前疫情期間晚上只有日料，沒有薯條之類的小點,"There are many types of whiskey, and the service staff introduced very detailed and professional, but the price is slightly higher. People who come to come will consider the suffering of the lotus bag first. At present, there are only Japanese materials in the evening during the epidemic."
餐酒館 味道比較重不喝酒的 嚐鮮也可以,The taste of the restaurant is relatively heavy without drinking.
朋友輕鬆聚會的好地方。餐點好吃，氣氛很棒,"A good place for friends to meet easily.The meal is delicious, the atmosphere is great"
味道很不錯除了價格偏高其他無可挑惕😍 …,"The taste is very good, except that the price is high, the other is not be able to be vigilant ..."

"好讚的酒吧，氣氛好，調酒師幽默👍
讚死了🥰愛瘋了 …","Happy bars, the atmosphere is good, the bartender is humorous
Praise to death 疯 love crazy ..."
環境好，很適合聊天，麻辣豬腳跟煎餃必點,"The environment is good, it is very suitable for chatting, the spicy pig's heel fried dumplings must be ordered"
"東西非常好吃，特別是滷肉飯和炒泡麵。
那天服務我們的Bartender對於每隻酒的認識希望可以更加強（總共點了三瓶），關於酒廠的歷史以及釀造的方法都能在講的詳細一些。
另外一起去的同事因為開車不能喝酒，請服務生不要勸酒，酒駕很危險。","Things are very delicious, especially braised pork rice and fried noodles.
On that day, the hope of serving our Bartender's understanding of each wine can be strengthened (three bottles in total). The history of the winery and the method of brewing can be detailed.
The other colleagues who went together could not drink because they drove. Please do not persuade the waiter. Driving is very dangerous."
第一杯酒等了30分鐘左右，還以為是人比較等比較久，結果是漏單，期間明明坐在吧檯也沒有服務員或調酒師發現，跟信義區的後苑服務品質差距有點大。,"The first glass of wine waited for about 30 minutes. I thought it was a long time. The result was the leakage. During the period, there was no waiter or a bartender to find that the quality gap with the back garden in Xinyi District was a bit large."
空調超熱 調酒真的不行要什麼沒什麼 食物也不好吃,"Air conditioner ultra -heat alcohol is really not available, what is not food, it is not delicious"
超級好吃，Bartender介紹的很好，搭配調酒真的太完美了,"Super delicious, Bartender introduced very well, it is really perfect with bartending bartending"
貴 環境還不錯 餐點還行 酒種類多,"The expensive environment is not bad, and there are many types of wine"
空間營造和食物都好，單價略高些，吃巧非吃飽。,"The space construction and food are good, the unit price is slightly higher, and it is not enough to eat."
"真的超棒的 在這裡就像在自己家一樣 非常的舒適
威士忌 和 咖啡  餐點都非常的讚","It's really good here as very comfortable as in your own home
Both whiskey and coffee meals are very praised"
鍋貼鍋貼得第一，還有炒泡麵,"The pot stickers are first, and fry noodles"
昨天帶國外朋友，我們有訂包廂但是我們人太多了，有些人想做外面，店員請我們講話要小聲不能走來走去，旁邊的店員還邊翻白眼，但我覺得很沒禮貌，不會再去了，但威士忌是好喝的。,"Yesterday, we brought foreign friends, we have a box, but we have too many people. Some people want to do outside. The clerk asked us to speak whispering and not to walk around. Go again, but the whiskey is delicious."
"在這裡我感受到有史以來最差的體驗，若非酒保、店員或老闆的朋友，不建議前往。
.
從入座都離開約莫兩小時的時間都坐在吧檯，卻不曾遇到員工主動詢問是否需要點酒，都要以眼神交會後示意，才會前來詢問，加水情況亦同，約莫坐我右邊的客人水杯空了至少 10 分鐘，左邊客人水杯空了至少 15 分鐘，但是員工都在各自忙各自的事情，洗杯子、收杯子、請喝 Shot、做酒、送餐，但是沒有要加水的意思。
.
整理桌面的狀況也是相當令人意外，同加水與點餐，整理桌面的時機讓人摸不著頭緒，員工想整理才整理，大部分的情況下客人用畢超過 10 分鐘後才會被注意到。在吧檯客人離開後，清潔很確實，但是沒有注意到前一桌客人留下的傘，由隔壁桌的客人提醒才注意到，有點難拿捏是注重客人感受還是注重清潔的店。
.
整個晚上可以聽見 Brandon 的撩妹聲，逗女孩笑（牡羊多帥哥、水瓶座如何），或是值班酒保聊加密貨幣（與客人聊曝險部位有多少），但是不熟店員不會與之攀談，連客人喜好、常去的酒吧也不見得會過問，這也是相當令人意外，與我過去去過的酒吧/餐酒館差異很大。
.
耳聞執杯大叔和 Brandon 的已久慕名而來，但是整體來說相當失望，也不禁讓我反思如果疫情趨近嚴重，那外送鼎泰豐或拉麵，在家裡開一瓶威士忌，一樣能夠有個不錯的晚上，視乎也沒有非要進酒吧不可的必要。
.
這裡的調酒和食物都相當到位也都具有水準，不過其他的部分，有點不太好說。","Here I feel the worst experience in history. If it is not a friend, a clerk or a friend of the boss, it is not recommended to go.
Then, then
I sat on the bar for about two hours from the seat, but I never encountered employees who actively asked if they needed to order wine. They had to sign up with their eyes to ask. The guests have been empty for at least 10 minutes, and the guests on the left have been empty for at least 15 minutes, but the employees are busy with their own affairs. Washing the cups, collecting cups, drinking shot, making wine, and delivery, but there is no meaning to add water.
Then, then
The condition of sorting the desktop is also quite surprising. The time to add water and ordering. The timing of the tabletop is unspeakable. Employees want to organize before finishing. In most cases, the guests will be noticed after more than 10 minutes.After the guests left at the bar, cleaning is really true, but did not notice the umbrella left by the guests in the previous table. The guests of the next table reminded that it was a bit difficult to control whether it was a shop that focused on the feelings of the guests or the cleaning.
Then, then
You can hear the sound of Brandon's sister -in -law all night, tease the girl with a smile (how the Aries is handsome, how about Aquarius), or the duty wine guarantee to talk about cryptocurrencies (how much is the exposure to the guests) Talking, even the bars that guests like or go often may not be asked. This is also quite surprising, which is very different from the bar/meal tavern I have visited in the past.
Then, then
I heard that Uncle and Brandon had been in a long time, but the overall disappointment was quite disappointed, and I couldn't help but reflect that if the epidemic approached seriously, it would be good In the evening, there is no unnecessary to enter the bar.
Then, then
The bartending and food here are quite in place and level, but the other parts are a bit not easy to say."
"松露牛肉白蘭地溫泉蛋沙拉
注射進去蛋裡的是白蘭地","Truffle beef Bailan ground hot spring egg salad
The injection in the egg is Bailan Di"
滷肉飯很貴但很好吃。調酒也都很好，信義的那家也是我的心頭好,"The braised pork rice is expensive but delicious.The bartending is also very good, and the one in Xinyi is also my heart is good"
"三訪，前兩次還不錯也很開心
最近一次在這裡慶生，食物變難吃，一直點不同的食物結果每一樣都失望，調酒難喝，點兩杯酒精都超級淡，不知道在喝什麼，服務糟糕，站起來招手、揮手永遠看不到，在面前也直接無視。
只有薯條和花生好吃⋯
好店又少一家啦～","Three visits, good and happy the first two times
The last time I celebrated my birthday here, the food became difficult, and the results of different foods were disappointed. I was so disappointed that I had two cups of alcohol. I didn't know what was drinking. The service was bad. I can't see it, I ignore it directly.
Only fries and peanuts are delicious ...
There is a few good shops ~"
"空間環境部分
如果白天想喝調酒，這裡會是很好的選擇，一樓挑高天花板有綠色點綴感覺寬敞舒適，沙發區的位置很棒！有機會應該要做吧檯，近距離觀賞調酒師的專業操作！

餐點部分
1.椒麻豬腳：
超級好吃（且份量充足），口味偏麻，不會很辣，不敢吃辣的人也可嘗試看看，很下酒
2.滷肉飯：
也很好吃！會黏嘴唇的那種！值得這個價格

調酒部分
這邊主打whiskey的調酒
High ball選擇很多
我點的是suntory知多，味道清爽且平衡恰到好處，很解膩

強烈推建喜歡威士忌的朋友來訪，對威士忌有興趣的人也可以來這邊嘗試找到自己喜歡的種類。

五星推薦，必定二訪名單納入！","Space environment
If you want to drink alcohol during the day, it will be a good choice. The high ceiling on the first floor has green embellishment and it feels spacious and comfortable. The location of the sofa area is great!If you have the opportunity, you should do the bar, watch the professional operation of the bartender at close range!

Meal part
1. Pepper -pork feet:
Super delicious (and the portion is sufficient), the taste is numb, it will not be very spicy, people who dare not eat spicy can also try to see it.
2. Braised pork rice:
It's also delicious!The kind of sticky lips!Worth this price

Alcoholic part
Here is the main fight for Whiskey's bartending
High Ball choose a lot
I ordered a lot of SunTory. The taste is refreshing and the balance is just right. It is very greasy.

Strongly pushing friends who like whiskey to visit, people who are interested in whiskey can also come here to try to find the types of their favorite.

Five -star recommendation, the second visit list must be included!"
價格中上，但品質真的超乎想像，日料魚貨新鮮好吃。酒宮格菜色精緻，招牌的炒泡麵微辣涮嘴。重點是酒的種類繁多，調酒十分有特色，店家威士忌更是香，味雙絕。服務周到，不會有高級餐廳的拘謹，用餐氣氛十分放鬆愉快。不管懂不懂威士忌的人都可以得到不一樣的體驗。,"In the price, the quality is really beyond imagination. Japanese fish products are fresh and delicious.The wine palace is delicate, and the signature instant noodles are slightly spicy.The point is that there are many types of wine, and the bartending is very distinctive.The service is thoughtful, there will be no restraint of high -end restaurants, and the meal atmosphere is very relaxed and happy.No matter if you understand the whiskey, you can get a different experience."
酒比較好喝，餐中上,"The wine is more delicious, and the meal is on the meal"
無趣又昂貴的酒吧，雖然蠻會介紹的，但感覺一杯才30ml的威士忌要價600實在離譜，大概台北人真的比較凱,"The boring and expensive bar, although it will be introduced, but it feels that the price of only 30ml of whiskey is 600, which is really outrageous."
每次來都想說再也不要來的地方，可惜內湖選擇太少，有時懶得進城還是勉強來。最近改成過凌晨12點之後沒調酒，好像更沒理由前往消費。,"Every time I want to say that I don't want to come again, but unfortunately there are too few Neihu choices, and sometimes they are too lazy to enter the city.Recently, I have not been bunk after 12 am, and there seems to be no reason to go to consumption."
"環境很好，滷肉飯好吃，鱸魚也很不錯！
大推","The environment is very good, the braised pork rice is delicious, and the sea bass is also very good!
Push"
都是龍吟吃完才會來喝一杯,They will drink a drink after eating it after eating
"大推，如果你不想在家放一堆酒，又想與親朋好友享受細緻品酒的樂趣，這裡是絕佳選擇，除了多到嚇人的威士忌收藏，也有IPA啤酒(內行的)，各色調酒都很amazing, Tequila與其他烈酒都可以品嘗，，，最讚的是，餐飲水準很高，決不是用炸雞炸薯應付的pub，壽司水準真的不錯，Uni新鮮!! 總之，喜好品酒人士不會失望的!!","Push, if you don't want to put a bunch of wines at home, and want to enjoy meticulous wine tasting with friends and relatives. This is an excellent choice. In addition to the scary whiskey collection, there are IPA beer Very Amazing, Tequila and other spirits can be tasted. The most well is that the level of catering is very high. It is by no means a PUB cope with fried chicken. Sushi is really good. People will not be disappointed !!"
餐點好吃！（但為什麼沒有賣珍珠地瓜煎餃了？那個很好吃欸，太可惜了QQ）我覺得甜點跟調酒都滿厲害的，東泉辣椒醬也很好吃，裝潢也很美，服務生們也都很親切，對威士忌如數家珍，下次去想吃吃看滷肉飯。,"The meal is delicious!(But why didn't you sell pearl sweet potatoes to fried dumplings? That is delicious, but unfortunately QQ) I think dessert and bartending are full of bartending. They are also very kind. I want to eat a few family treasures for whiskey. I want to eat rice rice rice next time."
"這是一家餐酒館，提供的菜餚下酒菜也都很好吃．
1.怪味雞入味有淡淡奇怪的味道，醬料有四川麻辣味。
2.櫻花蝦高麗菜，櫻花蝦有炸過與高麗菜快炒後特別的香。
3.香煎鱸魚外酥內嫩且Ｑ彈，胡椒鹽有山葵的味道，鹹鹹嗆嗆的。","This is a tavern, and the dishes provided are also delicious.
1. The weird chicken has a weird taste, and the sauce has the spicy flavor of Sichuan.
2. Sakura shrimp, Korean cabbage, cherry shrimp has been fried and fried with Korean cuisine.
3. Crystal bass is crispy and tender inside and elastic. The pepper and pepper have the smell of mountains and sunflowers, salty and salty."
"第一次拜訪。

服務生一直送錯餐點，連自己送來的東西都不知道是什麼，叫計程車也無法handle, 服務⭐️⭐️.
環境⭐️⭐️，空調狂從頭灌，換位置還是一樣。
調酒還是喜歡信義的。

"很美的店
但餐點選擇不多
份量也不多","Beautiful shop
But there are not many meals
There are not much portion"
在這邊快一年了，放鬆好去處,"It's almost a year here, relax, go well"
"心血來潮拜訪
燈光氛圍真的很棒
但...
如果喝調酒真的別去！
神風特攻隊，我們要求酸點，但調出來確實有酸，但是酒感完全木有....真的傻爆眼....
Mojito 很順但真的很淡.....
最後沒有酒單是有的傻眼⋯⋯
這樣根本不知道價錢是多少！
雖然是威士忌酒吧！
也只賣經典調酒，但是總要有酒單吧⋯⋯
阿不就我以前做過吧台.....不然我哪裡知道有什麼經典調酒.....
整體真的很失望......
不會再去拜訪惹.....
推薦各位參考看看吧！","Visit
The light atmosphere is really great
but...
Don't go if you drink alcohol!
The Shenfeng special attack team, we ask for acidity, but it is indeed sour when it is tuned, but the wine feels completely ... really stupid .....
Mojito is smooth but really light ...
In the end, there is no wine list, there are dumbfounded ...
I don't know how much the price is at all!
Although it is a whiskey bar!
I only sell classic bartender, but there must always be wine list ...
I have done a bar before ..... otherwise, where can I know what classic bartender .....
The whole is really disappointed ...
I won't visit again ...
Recommended you for reference!"
地點環境氛圍都不錯。以餐點的CP值來看是適中。 在英迪格酒店同棟大樓的一樓。開車的話可留酒店樓下還蠻方便的。,The location of the location is good.The CP value of meals is moderate.On the first floor of the same building in the Wingdig Hotel.It is quite convenient to stay downstairs if you drive.
冬天沒有暖氣，冷冷的酒吧喝冰冰的酒，體驗不會太好。二百多的滷肉飯裡面有鍋巴一樣的飯粒。鮮魚湯溫溫的，我以為會是熱呼呼的。酒還不錯。,"There is no heating in winter. Drinking ice wine in cold bars will not experience too well.There are more than two hundred braised pork rice with pot -like rice grains.Fresh fish soup is warm, I think it will be hot.Wine is pretty good."
調酒厲害，食物不錯,"The bartender is great, the food is good"
"氣氛佳
適合聚會.飲酒的好地方
食物行但稍貴","Good atmosphere
Suitable for party. Good place for drinking
Food is slightly more expensive"

餐點好吃 威士忌種類多,There are many types of delicious whiskey for meals
氣氛很好，是個適合下班後喝一杯準備休假的地方。,"The atmosphere is very good, it is a place to drink a cup of vacation after get off work."
威士忌藏量豐富，High Coast威士忌巧克力蛋糕也很好吃！,"The whiskey is rich in hidden, and the High Coast whiskey chocolate cake is also delicious!"
海鮮新鮮，調酒好喝一點微醺真是舒服,"The seafood is fresh, and it is really comfortable to be a little bit delicious."
氛圍不錯,Good atmosphere

咖啡跟調酒都超棒,Coffee and bartending are great
後苑其實像後門  後花園  你懂,"Houyuan is actually like the back door back garden, you understand"
"很高興是一個四星級的地方。食物略高於平均水平，以中式融合風格提供（以積極的方式）。
青口——精挑細選的台灣本地青口。肥美多汁，配上美味的醬汁
薯條 - 與啤酒搭配得很好（不確定他們是否有啤酒。）也許是威士忌
海拼盤－很棒的東西。精選海鮮，採用西式擺盤技術裝飾
紅燒肉飯——這裡必點。你不應該以任何方式錯過這個
雞翅 - 不錯，但很普通，有點辣。服務生應該提醒一下，因為雞翅配薯條
雞肉義大利麵 - 幾乎和樓上的 GMT 義大利餐廳一樣好。喜歡泡泡

即使您不喝酒，也請確保在訪問時點一些飲料。","I am very happy to be a four -star place.Food is slightly higher than the average level, provided in a Chinese -style fusion style (in a positive way).
Qingkou -carefully selected local Qingkou.Fat and juicy, with delicious sauce
French fries -matching with beer (uncertain whether they have beer.) Maybe it's whiskey
Sea platter -great thing.Selected seafood, use Western -style setting technology decoration
Braised meat rice -must order here.You should not miss this in any way
Chicken wings -good, but very ordinary, a bit spicy.The waiter should remind, because chicken wings with fries with fries
Chicken Pasta -almost as good as the GMT Italian restaurant upstairs.Like bubble

Even if you don't drink, make sure you order some drinks during access."
"我必須說這裡的食物和工作人員都是最好的。
這次我點的菜都很美味，而且價格也很合理。
您也可以在這裡嘗試一些威士忌，因為這是一家威士忌酒吧餐廳。
必須來這裡一次，我很快就會再次來到這裡。","I have to say that the food and staff here are the best.
The dishes I ordered this time are all delicious and the price is reasonable.
You can also try some whiskey here because this is a whiskey bar restaurant.
I have to come here once, and I will come here soon."
我以前從未經歷過的令人驚嘆的威士忌之旅。工作人員教我們很多關於威士忌的知識，讓我想更了解威士忌！火腿和起司配上特製的醋汁真是太棒了！配上一口威士忌就更棒了！下次想多試試他們的日本料理,"I have never experienced a stunning whiskey trip.The staff teaches us a lot about whiskey, so that I want to know more about whiskey!It is great with ham and cheese with special vinegar!It is even better with a whiskey!Next time I want to try their Japanese cuisine more"
您可以在親切的解說下品嚐各種威士忌。威士忌的種類比你想像的還要多。然而，它太暗了，所以如果你想要明亮的氣氛，它可能不合適。,"You can taste all kinds of whiskey under kindergaining.There are more types of whiskey than you think.However, it is too dark, so if you want a bright atmosphere, it may be inappropriate."
令人驚嘆的空間和氛圍。 「服務生」很樂意將各式各樣的不同瓶裝酒帶到餐桌上介紹給您。只是對他們的內格羅尼（我最喜歡的飲料）版本有點失望，但杜松子酒和補品非常好。不幸的是，我們也很困惑為什麼他們的每個服務器都充當服務器和調酒師/調酒師。由於每個人同時從事 2/3 的工作，因此很難標記他們每個人。下次還是很樂意回來嘗試他們的菜餚。,"Amazing space and atmosphere.""Worship"" is happy to bring you all kinds of different bottled wines to the table to introduce you.It's just a bit disappointed with their version of Negranini (my favorite drink), but Du Songzi wine and supplements are very good.Unfortunately, we are also confused why each of their servers act as servers and bartender/bartender.Because everyone is engaged in 2/3 work at the same time, it is difficult to mark each of them.Next time I am still happy to come back and try their dishes."
"食物還可以
他們擁有的威士忌系列令人驚嘆，在台灣是獨一無二的，或者我以前在台灣從未見過這樣的系列
不好的是他們沒有任何威士忌菜單所以你應該知道你想要什麼","Food is okay
The whiskey they have is amazing that it is unique in Taiwan, or I have never seen such a series in Taiwan before
The bad thing is that they don't have any whiskey menu, so you should know what you want"
"下班後放鬆的好地方。
飯菜既美味又漂亮。洛爾
雞尾酒味道很好，他們甚至還提供無酒精雞尾酒。","A good place to relax after get off work.
The food is delicious and beautiful.Loro
The cocktail tastes very good, and they even provide wine -free cocktails."
"大直最好的小酒館。
品種繁多的招牌威士忌和優質葡萄酒。
菜色非常滿意，價格公道。","The best tavern in Dazhi.
There are many varieties of signature whiskey and high -quality wine.
The dishes are very satisfied and the price is fair."
不錯的雞尾酒和威士忌酒吧。氣氛很輕鬆，所以一個人去也很不錯。食物還可以，但是飲料和服務都很棒。值得再次光顧。,"Good cocktail and whiskey bar.The atmosphere is very easy, so it is also good to go alone.Food is okay, but drinks and services are great.It is worth visiting again."
大直/內湖地區最好的威士忌酒吧。尋找麥克，用他神奇的雙手你永遠不會失望！,"The best whiskey bar in Neihu/Neihu area.Looking for Mike, you will never be disappointed with his magical hands!"
"享用美味食物、雞尾酒和威士忌的好地方。
與安和原來的後院相比，小後院擴展了原始的獲勝公式。店面比較大，座位很多，裝潢很漂亮，氣氛也很棒。
無論是約會、商務會議、閒逛還是只是吃點東西，這裡絕對是您的理想選擇。","Enjoy a good place for delicious food, cocktails and whiskey.
Compared with An and the original backyard, the small backyard has expanded the original winning formula.The store is relatively large, there are many seats, the decoration is very beautiful, and the atmosphere is great.
Whether it's dating, business meetings, strolling or just eating something, it is definitely your ideal choice."
"良好的氛圍和良好的服務
威士忌種類很多，有服務費。","Good atmosphere and good service
There are many types of whiskey and have service fees."
Backyard Jr. 是喜歡泡麵的人的必去之地，泡麵的口味高級且美味。餐廳給我提供了我吃過的最貴的泡麵，而且一分錢一分貨。食材新鮮可口，尤其是完美的荷包蛋和美味的牛肉。雞尾酒也非常出色，製作精良且美味。我坐了很多人，調酒師真的很令人印象深刻。他提出了很好的建議並對口味有清晰的了解。他甚至可以在 YouTube 上開設一個關於調酒學的頻道，這會很受歡迎。總而言之，Backyard Jr. 是您沉迷於泡麵的絕佳去處，同時還可享用美味的雞尾酒。,"Backyard Jr. is a must -have place for those who like instant noodles. The taste of instant noodles is high -level and delicious.The restaurant provided me with the most expensive instant noodles I have ever eaten, and a penny and a penny.The ingredients are fresh and delicious, especially the perfect poached eggs and delicious beef.Cocktails are also very good, well -made and delicious.I sat on many people, and the bartender was really impressive.He made a good suggestion and had a clear understanding of the taste.He can even open a channel for bartending science on YouTube, which is very popular.All in all, Backyard Jr. is an excellent place for you to indulge in instant noodles, and you can also enjoy delicious cocktails."
非常好的餐廳，有很多威士忌可供選擇，而且食物很美味！,"A very good restaurant, there are many whiskey to choose from, and the food is delicious!"
環境寬敞舒適，服務人員熱情,"The environment is spacious and comfortable, and the service staff is enthusiastic"
"缺乏專業服務，例如錯過了超過2道菜的訂單。辦公桌整理和維護需要改進。

推薦生雞尾酒，但菜餚一般。

總而言之，如果您正在尋找葡萄酒或雞尾酒，那麼絕對值得推薦，二星級。","Lack of professional services, such as missing more than 2 dishes.Design and maintenance need to be improved.

Raw cocktails are recommended, but the dishes are average.

All in all, if you are looking for wine or cocktails, then it is definitely worth recommending, two -star."
預訂了 12 人的商務午餐，價格為 1200 的私人空間。  我出現在 1130 試圖點餐，這樣他們就不會著急。  工作人員不耐煩，告訴我不行，要等到12點。  我們點了 12 種飲料，沒有一種很複雜（啤酒和高杯酒）。  第一杯飲料是在 12:50 供應的，第一頓食物是在 12:45 供應的，在我們坐下後幾乎一個小時，午餐！  坐下後六十分鐘我們才拿到所有的飲料，這讓商務午餐變得非常尷尬。  我的同事和客戶不敢再訂購一輪，因為他們不想用完時間。  當我與工作人員聊天時，我被告知「由於新冠疫情，我們人手短缺」。  由於新冠疫情，你們要求客戶保持靈活性，我對此表示理解，但當我要求提前訂購時，你們沒有為客戶提供靈活性。  帶我的客戶去那裡我感到很尷尬。再也不會了。,"Booking 12 people's business lunches, a private space with a price of 1200.I tried to order in 1130, so they would not worry.The staff was impatient and told me not to wait until 12 o'clock.We ordered 12 drinks, none of them were very complicated (beer and high cup of wine).The first drink was supplied at 12:50, the first food was supplied at 12:45, almost an hour after we sat down, lunch!We only got all the drinks after sitting down, which made the business lunch very embarrassing.My colleagues and customers dare not order another round because they don't want to run out of time.When I was chatting with the staff, I was told that ""we have a shortage of hand due to the new crown epidemic.""Due to the new crown epidemic, you ask customers to maintain flexibility, I understand this, but when I ask for order in advance, you do not provide customers with flexibility.I feel embarrassed to take my client.No longer."
美味的雞尾酒和食物。即使遠離市區也值得一遊！,Delicious cocktails and food.It is worth visiting even away from the urban area!
食物和酒是完美的。良好的服務。,Food and wine are perfect.Good service.
雖然是一家特色餐廳，但提供國際化、優雅的美食，工作人員的服務也令人滿意。,"Although it is a characteristic restaurant, it provides international and elegant food, and the staff's services are also satisfactory."
食物低於平均水平，特別是豬腳（全是骨頭，有一些皮），價格昂貴，我想我不會再回去了。,"The food is lower than the average level, especially the pig's feet (all bones, there are some skin), and the price is expensive. I don't think I will go back anymore."
