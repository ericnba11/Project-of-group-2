"「傳統市場」主題的酒單挺特別。

前面分享了 Bar Dip 的客家料理元素，這次來到近幾個月才開幕、正當紅的 Bar Pine 體驗這季「魚市場」的元素。掃過 Signature cocktail 就可以發現一些有趣的食材被揉進調酒中。

平常很多人退避三舍的食材，如豆腐乳、香菜、蔥，甚至是苦瓜，都被融入主理人的創意，但必須先說喜歡與否很大一部分會取決於每個人的飲食偏好。

前兩杯喝了肉鬆與山苦瓜，都是氣泡感很適合開頭，尤其是肉鬆的有種微妙的肉鬆麵包感但又有小黃瓜清新的氣息。山苦瓜則跟茶味配合地相得益彰，不過說不苦絕對是騙人的。

白芝麻那杯（茶杯）附上了一塊很詭異的黑色物體，想不到竟然是黑胡椒口味的海綿蛋糕，不過酒本身沒有特別喜歡。而這裡的 Espresso Martini 走經典但非常 dry 的路線，喝不慣可能也合理（但用的也是 COT 的濃縮呢）

之後再來一篇分享食物，我覺得比這季調酒更出色、更讓我印象深刻。很可惜沒機會喝到破布子那杯，否則鹹甜搭配堅果風味應該會是我喜歡的。","The ""traditional market"" theme wine list is very special.

The Hakka cuisine elements of Bar Dip have been shared earlier. This time, it has only opened in recent months. Bar Pine, which has been opened in recent months, has experienced the element of the ""fish market"" this season.After sweeping Signature Cocktail, you can find that some interesting ingredients are rubbed into bartender.

Many people usually retreat from the ingredients of Sanhe, such as tofu, coriander, green onion, and even bitter gourd, which are integrated into the creativity of the principal, but must first say that a large part of it will depend on everyone's dietary preference.

The first two glasses of drinking meat pine and mountain bitter gourd are all suitable for the beginning, especially the delicate meat pine bread feels but has a fresh atmosphere of cucumber.The bitter gourd complement the tea flavor, but it is definitely deceiving not to say that it is definitely deceiving.

The White Sesame Cup (Tea Cup) attached a very weird black object. I didn't expect it to be a black pepper -flavored sponge cake, but the wine itself did not like it.And the ESPRESSO MARTINI here takes a classic but very DRY route. It may be reasonable to drink it (but it is also concentrated by COT)

從第一季酒單就存在的山苦瓜，很好喝，沒有山苦瓜的苦，卻保留了他的清爽，搭配細緻氣泡的柚香金萱，會讓人不小心一口氣喝完！

綠竹筍則是讓我驚艷，清甜而不膩的味道，令人想起蘆筍汁，搭配康提起司與青花椒油竹筍，再次喝下，嘴裡濃郁的奶香，讓整杯又多了點趣味，真好玩。

來了兩季，每季都好喜歡阿❤️

🥬🧅第一季: 菜市場🥒🌽

-野生山苦瓜／肖楠木／梅子／柚香金萱: 喜歡喜歡!相當細膩的一杯酒。
山苦瓜的苦與肖楠木互相呼應，再由清香的金萱將微苦轉為回甘。
真的是喜歡的不得了，第二季看到他還在菜單上真的差點哭出來，還要Ariel跟我保證之後都會在。
⁡
-油蔥酥/水蜜桃/鰹魚
看到每桌都有點，我忍不住就跟風了起來。第一次看到油蔥酥入酒，感覺很酷。
油蔥酥風味相當強烈，建議要搭餐。我是吃完飯才點的，是好喝的但還是有點肘擊到。
⁡
-食物: 炸雞薯條都推推，湯品也非常有特色。(但麵真的要速吃，放涼之後會比較有難度)
⁡
🌊🦪第二季: 海口味🦐🐟
一直以來對於海、海浪就莫名的嚮往，聽到這一季的主題是海口味，差點拿了錢包就出門!!!
⁡
-肉鬆 / 小黃瓜 / 焦化奶油: 一湊近鼻子就聞到淡淡的肉鬆味，差點轉頭叫白稀飯。
光看說明會誤以為是重口味的酒，但一入口卻相當清爽，非常輕鬆好入口。
所有的氣味完美融合在一起，美好卻不衝突，滿滿的夏日感。
Ariel說當初也沒想到真的會成功，只能說妳棒棒👏🏻
⁡
-破布子 / 椰子花糖 / 堅果: 一聞就覺得鹹鹹的，非常搭海鮮。(或倒進去蒸魚)
在尚未吃飯時喝，酒感稍稍重。但當你開始進食之後，卻出乎意料的有夠搭!!
食物的鹹香與油香巧妙的與調酒交織出了一首圓舞曲，兩者搭配得極好。
尤其如果你有點海鮮或炸物，必須點!(自己說)
⁡
-一夜干: 肉質鮮嫩，香氣十足，配破布子剛剛好!
-松式半敲燒: 炙燒後風味極好，搭配清爽的生洋蔥非常對味(也好適合啤酒)。

總體而言喜歡的不得了，不過也是很見仁見智。如果你是想要喝醉或拍Fancy調酒照的話可能就沒那麼適合。

I have always longed for the sea and waves. I heard the theme of this season is sea flavor. I almost took the wallet and went out !!!
Bleak
-Pats pine / cucumber / coking cream: When you get close to your nose, you smell a faint meat pine flavor.
Just looking at the explanation will mistakenly think that it is a heavy taste wine, but the entrance is quite refreshing, and it is very easy to enter the entrance.
All odors are perfectly integrated, beautiful but not conflicting, full of summer sense.
Ariel said that I didn't expect it to be successful at first, but I can only stab you
Bleak
-Puzi / Coconut Flower Sugar / Nut: I feel salty when I smell it, and it is very seafood.(Or pour in steamed fish)
Drinking before eating, the wine feels heavier.But when you start eating, you are unexpectedly enough !!
The salty aroma and oil fragrance of the food cleverly intertwined with the bartender, and the two are very well matched.
Especially if you have some seafood or fried objects, you must order! (Say yourself)

薯條配的醬很像昆布糖打細碎比較濕的版本，跟薯條搭配略顯無聊，可以請店員給番茄醬。個人覺得不太喜歡，吃不太懂，但是認真說醬跟薯條分開吃都沒問題。

"絕對稱得上台北酒吧的天花板！
裝潢、調酒、服務、氣氛都相當高級有質感。
＊裝潢-一推開外門，看到的是由石板、鵝卵石鋪陳的昏暗玄關，營造出一種進入秘境的神秘及期待感。拉開第二道門才一窺店內吧台及座位區。店內裝潢設計語彙相當一致，牆面高質感的水泥灰配上吧台檯面的原木色，相當具有日系風格，與店名「松」的意象完美呼應，給人一種放鬆的感覺。
＊調酒-今天點了三杯創作調酒：芭樂、山苦瓜、百香果。個人最喜歡芭樂，整體風味清新淡雅，芭樂氣味相當自然，毫無化工感，同時又帶有氣泡，喝起來非常舒服，適合當第一杯。山苦瓜味道相當高級，像在品嚐一支高檔的木質調香水，整體酒感也是偏清爽，但又比芭樂的風味更強烈一些，個人也是相當推薦！百香果也令人驚艷，看似衝突的元素，融合起來卻意想不到地和諧、毫無違和感。整體酒感又比芭樂和山苦瓜更厚重一些些。
綜合來講，這三杯調酒都非常有特色，相較許多酒吧的調酒用過分的糖漿營造一種很好喝的假象，松的調酒既不甜膩，卻又喝得出調酒師的用心，還非常好喝又有層次，值得細細品味。
＊服務-接待人員相當親切，調酒師服務也很周到，除了會主動詢問、介紹菜單之外，補水也補的很勤XD 值得一提的是，女友因為座位處於冷氣風量較大處而與我換位置，女調酒師看到我們換位置即馬上詢問會冷嗎？需不需要毛毯？這貼心的問候無疑讓人感覺被重視，看得出店家相當在意客人的感受，這點非常加分！
＊氣氛-店內的燈光設計非常好，不會過分明亮，也不會過於昏暗，照明處剛好都落在顧客前方的檯面上，讓上桌的不管是餐點或調酒，都得到恰到好處的彰顯，對於整體的用餐及飲酒體驗達到錦上添花的效果，重點是照片拍出來非常好看👍🏻
整體消費體驗絕對超過五顆星😆","Absolutely farewell to the ceiling of the Taipei Bar!
Decoration, bartending, service, and atmosphere are quite advanced and textured.
＊ Decoration-As soon as the outside door is pushed open, I see the dim porch paved by the slate and pebbles, creating a mystery and expectation of entering the mystery.Open the second door to get a glimpse of the bar and seat area in the shop.The interior decoration of the store is quite consistent. The high -quality cement ash on the wall is matched with the original wood color on the bar. It is quite Japanese style. It perfectly echoes the image of the store name ""Song"", giving a sense of relaxation.
＊ Banjin-I ordered three cups of creative bartending today: Bara, Mountain Bitter Gourd, Passion Fruit.Personally like Berli, the overall flavor is fresh and elegant, the Bayo smell is quite natural, without a sense of chemical industry, and at the same time, it has bubbles. It is very comfortable to drink, suitable for the first cup.The taste of mountain bitter gourd is quite high -level. Like tasteing a high -end wooden perfume, the overall wine feels refreshing, but it is stronger than the flavor of Bara. Personally it is quite recommended!Passion fruits are also amazing, and seemingly conflict elements are unexpectedly harmonious and unwilling to be unreasonable.The overall wine feels more heavier than Bale and mountain bitter gourd.
In summary, these three cups of bartending are very distinctive. Compared with many bartender of many bars, excessive syrup creates a very delicious illusion. The teacher's intentions are very delicious and layered, which is worthy of careful taste.
＊ Services-The reception staff is quite kind, and the bartender service is also very thoughtful. In addition to actively inquiring and introducing the menu, it is very diligent in hydration. XD is worth mentioning. When I change my position, the feminine winemaker will immediately ask if we change the position and ask if it will be cold?Do you need a blanket?This intimate greeting undoubtedly makes people feel valued. It can be seen that the store is quite concerned about the feelings of the guests. This is very extra points!
＊ Atmosphere-The lighting design in the store is very good, it will not be too bright, and it will not be too dim. The lighting place just falls on the table in front of the customer, so that the table is on the table, whether it is meals or alcohol.

Bar Pine 松門口非常簡單低調，不查詢會讓人以為是米其林餐廳，進入大門後有一個簡單的庭園，再來才是非常有日式氛圍的用餐空間，座位區為高腳椅吧台、多人圓桌，室內空間較小，但用餐環境安靜且充滿視覺藝術（店名的暈墨-松、復古式音響等），忙碌的一天可以沉澱心靈的空間。

第一季菜單主題為「菜市場」，從市場中尋找元素，融入調酒當中，Signature cocktail酒單中就可以發現，平常在調酒中很少喝到的香菜、蔥白、山苦瓜等都融入於這季調酒中，用創意沖擊調酒新市場。

Joe推薦必點
1.野生山苦瓜
第一杯非常適合，清爽酒感上不會過於強烈，整體茶風味突顯，特別是梅子、梅心的部分酸甜恰到好處。

2.百香果
聞上去有種特殊厚重的味道，蔥白/煎茶香？但喝起來卻清爽無比，口感風味上還是以百香果味較為明顯。

3.紅心芭樂
口感上偏甜，尾韻會帶有一點山葵風味，但不是嗆辣感不用擔心，而且這杯喝的別快，輕鬆又好喝。

整體酒單上的風味都喝得出來，也非常有創意，也感謝朋友酒單上的酒都點了一輪，每杯Joe幾乎都有喝到一口，喜歡酒感強烈一點的推薦紫米、香菜，味道比較濃郁一些。

Signature Cocktail can be found in that the coriander, green onion, mountain bitter gourd, etc. that are rarely drinking in bartender are bleed into In this quarter, a new market is impacted with creativity.

Joe recommendation must order
1. Wild Mountain bitter gourd

2. Passion fruit
There is a special and thick flavor to smell, white/fried tea fragrance?But it is very refreshing, and the taste flavor is still more obvious.

"很難得去到一間讓我想來留評論的店

先說優點：
1.特色調酒口味真的很特別，是好喝的
2.女服務生都很親切有笑容也很認真介紹酒及餐點
3.服務生桌面清潔服務滿勤勞，會一直過來加水

以下是不會想再回訪的原因：
1.食物不太合我們這桌的口味，掛包裡的牛肉很乾（我們是沒吃晚餐很餓的去的居然還沒人有辦法吃完它），口味方面畢竟比較主觀因人而異就不再多加敘述其他餐點。
2.因為有壽星我們訂了生日蛋糕，店員很親切的幫我們冰起來並願意幫我們準備好端過來，但說蛋糕不會提供餐具給我們，我們不是沒有在店裡點吃的來白白使用你們的餐具，個人覺得「這項規矩」滿扣分的。
3.請某位男店員幫忙合照，因為座位角度問題跟燈光不夠於是我們移步到就在我們座位旁邊的門口（一步路的距離）想拍全身合照，男店員不是很開心的回覆：「在門口會擋到人進出」，好奇貴店的門口是連拍一張照的時間都不能的嗎？那張照片我們應該用了不到30秒就拍完，我相信貴店雖然好生意但應該不會每分每秒都有人在進出，且如果真的遇到人要進出我們也ㄧ定會讓人先進出不會硬擋在那阿（雖然最後店員還是幫我們拍了，但他臉很不悅讓客人感受極差，去過那麼多餐酒館第一次遇到店家好像不想客人拍照的）。補充說明：我們也不是那種進去一直在猛拍照的網美，我們就在座位合照了一次發現光線不好，再來就是門口這張了。
4.朋友網上訂位時沒有看到有寫限時2小時（也許你們有寫我們沒看到這我們不確定），但到店內入座前建議讓店員再提醒一下用餐有限時（應該不會只有我們不知道有限時），而不是我們坐了1個半小時店員突然來說剩30分鐘要最後加點，我們聽到都傻眼覺得怎麼喝到一半突然說要結束了。
5.來提醒最後加點時我們說桌上的酒還剩ㄧ點，我們喝完桌上的看看如果時間允許我們再開一瓶，店員回現在就要先決定要不要加點，可以等我們喝完再把酒拿過來，於是我們問那如果現在加點我們喝超過時間怎麼辦？店員回沒辦法後面還有訂位。
我們不是不願在時間內加點，我們是怕點了喝超過你們的時間才會提出能否喝完桌上再決定。
店員堅守1個半小時ㄧ定要決定加點的這項「規矩」，不會變通讓客人感受是剖差的。

其實都不怪店員，我想店員也只是跟著貴店的「規矩」在回覆客人，但因為以上種種我們不是在開心放鬆的心情下離開的。

以上評論全無編造給大家參考

圖片附上當天有點的品項及金額。","It's hard to go to a shop that makes me want to leave a comment

First talk about advantages:
1. The specialty bartender taste is really special, it is delicious
2. Women waiters are very kind, smile, and carefully introduce wine and meals.
3. The waiter's desktop cleaning service is full of hard work and will always come over to add water

The reason for the following is the reasons that I do not want to return to the visit:
1. The food is not very good at the taste of our table, and the beef in the bag is very dry (we are hungry without dinner, but no one has a way to finish it). After all, the taste is more subjective. No more other meals are described.
2. Because of Shouxing we booked a birthday cake, the clerk was very kind to help us ice and are willing to help us prepare it, but say that the cake will not provide tableware for us. Your tableware personally feels that ""this rule"" is full.
3. Ask a male clerk to help take a photo, because the problem of the seat angle and the light are not enough, so we move to the door next to our seat (the distance from one step) to take a photo of the whole body. Will it be blocked at the door. ""Curious that the door of Guidian was ca n’t take a photo of a continuous photo?We should take the photo in that photo in less than 30 seconds. I believe that despite the good business of your store, it should not be in and out every minute and every second. People will not be able to block it in the first place (although the clerk still helped us shoot, but his face was very unpleasant to make the guests feel very bad. For the first time I met so many restaurants, it seems that the shop does not want guests to take pictures) EssenceSupplementary instructions: We are not the kind of net beauty that has been taking pictures in the fiercely. We took a group photo once and found that the light was not good, and then the one was the door.
4. When a friend is booked online, I did not see a limited time for 2 hours (maybe you wrote that we did not see this, we are not sure), but it is recommended that the clerk before entering the store to remind me that the meal is limited (there should be no us I do n’t know if it is limited), not that we have taken one and a half hours for a while to say that the remaining 30 minutes will be added to the end. We hear that we all feel dumbfounded and feel that it is over.
5. Let's remind us that when we add some points, we say that there is still a little left on the table on the table. After drinking on the table, we will see if time allows us to open another bottle, and the clerk should decide whether to add points first. We can wait for us to drink After taking the wine again, we asked what if we add some time to drink for more than time?There is no way to return the clerk back.
We are not unwilling to add some time. We are afraid that when we order it more than you, we will propose whether we can drink it on the table before deciding.
The clerk adheres to the ""rules"" that you want to decide for one and a half hours, and it will not change to make the guest feel the difference.

In fact, I do n’t blame the clerk. I think the clerk just follows the “rules” of your shop to reply to the guests, but because we are not leaving in a happy and relaxing mood.

"補充回覆，自拍的事情是我們誤會了不好意思。
不過當晚我們消費 1600 元左右，店家折扣 95元。花了這樣的費用，收到的卻是這樣的服務品質與出餐速度只能說是敗興而歸。

但整體您的回覆還是沒有看到想檢討的意思，餐點現做必須等待「一小時」，我吃過這麼多餐廳還是第一次聽到，如果這在貴店是常態那我不敢恭維。還是謝謝您回覆。
_____________________________________________
如果是因為網路媒體有推薦想來試試看的人，請三思。以下幾點提供參考：（6/29晚上）

1. 酒跟其他店相比品質差不多，但這裡至少貴一百元以上。沒有到這裡喝酒的必要。

2. 食物非常非常不推薦，跟朋友點了鮭魚炊飯，$350。我跟朋友等了「一個小時」以上（因為是下班後沒吃飯直接過去的，肚子很餓），這麼貴的價格，但餐點水平令人傻眼。除了份量一個人吃都嫌不夠以外，鮭魚也很普通，四小塊，烤的太柴，也沒有特別的鮮甜感，我跟朋友一致認為我們自己做，除了更快以外，也肯定比較好吃。🙂

3. 服務生素質相當差—我跟朋友等了一個小時，服務生才送來餐點，這也就算了，服務生還把同樣餐點先給了隔壁桌比我們晚來20分鐘的客人。
這是非常不細膩的服務態度（更何況還有收服務費），即便我們是點了同一份餐點，隔壁桌的距離離廚房比較近，也應該要先將餐點給先來的客人，以示尊重與公平。這點讓人非常不滿。（另外服務生口齒不清，介紹餐點跟酒品時聽不太清楚在說什麼）

4. 我們跟隔壁桌的客人都在抱怨餐點怎麼這麼慢的同時間，四五個服務人員卻都擠在吧檯後，嘻嘻哈哈聊天，甚至開始拿酒瓶自拍（？），無視外場需要服務的客人。

5. 如果廚房人手不足，服務生應事先告知需要等多久，讓客人決定是否要等待。
跟朋友下班後很累（相信上班族都懂）只是想趕快吃點東西放鬆喝酒；結果沒想到等這麼久，還要忍受這些服務生的不尊重與不專業。如果貴店餐點提供的品項不穩定（當天熱門餐點通通沒有提供）、人手不足以滿足客人需求（當天甚至沒有滿桌，只有三組客人），那不如就不要賣餐點，我們可以先去填飽肚子再來喝酒。
（服務生說供應商端午連假後不明原因繼續休假，以致缺了某些食材，但已經將近月末，為何沒有找到其他供應商來源？不知道這是餐廳對於食材品質的堅持，或是沒有應變能力的藉口）

6. 店內的空間狹小，桌椅距離很近，非常擁擠，完全沒有隱私；雖然有些設計的確有工業風且一點清水模的感覺，但整體設計不良。

總結：餐點慘敗，服務態度不專業，價格又比一般酒吧貴，我跟朋友當天吃完就盡快離開不想在裡面受氣。真的是非常不好的體驗。
沒有任何值得再去的理由。一開始被網路媒體照片騙了，實際上只是間華而不實的店。我們很後悔，也希望貴店再加強服務生素質，不要再次打擊下班已經心靈很脆弱的社畜們。（我們等太久太餓，所以餐點一上就開始狂吃，所以只有酒的照片）","Supplementing, selfie is sorry for us to misunderstand.
However, we spent about 1,600 yuan that night, and the store discounted 95 yuan.After spending such costs, the quality of service and meal can only be said to be defeated.

But the overall response still does not see the meaning of the review. I must wait for ""one hour"" for meals. I have heard so many restaurants for the first time. If this is the norm in your shop, I dare not compliment EssenceThank you for replying.
__________________________________________________
If it is because there are people who are recommended for online media to try, please think twice.The following points are provided for reference: (6/29 evening)

1. Wine is similar to that of other stores, but at least one hundred yuan is more than 100 yuan here.It is not necessary to drink here.

2. The food is very, very not recommended. I ordered salmon cooking with my friends, $ 350.I waited for ""one hour"" with my friends (because I did n’t eat directly after get off work, and I was hungry). It was so expensive, but the level of meals was dumbfounded.Except for the weight, it is not enough to eat it alone, salmon is also very ordinary, four small pieces, roasted too firewood, and there is no special sweetness. I agree with my friends that we do it ourselves. eat.Bleak

3. The quality of the waiter is quite poor -I waited for an hour with my friends before the waiter gave me the meal. Even if it was, the waiter gave the same meal to the guests who came to the next table for 20 minutes later than us.
This is a very delicate service attitude (not to mention the service fee). Even if we ordered the same meal, the distance of the table next door is closer to the kitchen, and we should first give the meals to the guests first, To show respect and fairness.This is very dissatisfied.(In addition, the waiter is unclear, and I do n’t know what to say when I introduce meals and wine.)

4. We are complaining about how the meals are so slow at the same time with the guests next door, but the four or five service staff are crowded on the bar, chatting, and even starting to take the bottle to take a selfie (?) guest.

5. If the kitchen person is insufficient, the waiter should inform how long it takes to wait in advance to let the guest decide whether to wait.
I am tired after getting off work with my friends (I believe that office workers know) just want to eat something to relax and drink; I did not expect to wait for so long, and I have to endure the disrespect and unprofessional of these waiters.If the items provided by your restaurant meals are unstable (the popular meals that day are not provided), and the manpower is not enough to meet the needs of guests (there are even three groups of guests on the day, there are only three groups of guests), so don't sell meals. Go and fill your stomach before drinking.
(The waiter said that the supplier continued to take a vacation after the Dragon Boat Festival unknown reasons, so that some ingredients were missing, but it was almost the end of the month. Why didn’t you find other suppliers? Excuse of ability)

6. The space in the store is small, the table and chair distance is very close, very crowded, and there is no privacy at all; although some design does have industrial style and a little water mold, the overall design is poor.

Summary: The meal is defeated, the service attitude is unprofessional, and the price is more expensive than the average bar. I and my friends leave as soon as possible and don't want to suffer in it as soon as possible.It's really a very bad experience.
There is no reason to go again.At first, I was deceived by online media photos. In fact, it was just a real shop.We regret it, and we also hope that your store will strengthen the quality of the service, and do not hit the social animals who are already fragile in your heart again.(We waited too long and too hungry, so we started eating madly when the meal was on, so there was only photos of wine)",False,0.089,0.102,0.81,-0.8323

"2023-06-03 初次探訪PINE
喜歡這間店的裝潢 氛圍感 神秘且沉穩
強烈建議要訂位喔!
個人認為小小缺點是假日的低消 NTD 800/person 要稍微注意一下.
若是有搭配食物的話, 低消很容易達標 沒問題.
但若單純點酒類的話要注意一下, 因為PINE的酒很好喝且很實在! 實在的意思就是基酒給得很有誠意, 不會感覺套很多水稀釋沒有感覺. 再換句話說就是酒量不好~ 容易醉. 哈哈

個人超推薦PINE Classic Cocktail 的 Harvard Cooler – 以蘋果金白蘭地為基底, 搭配萊姆跟汽水. 聽似簡單, 但很清爽 酒感中等但非常好入口 會想一口接一口地喝下去.
另外喝的一杯是Signature Cocktail (這次前往的主題是台灣市場) 點了一杯白芝麻/金桔/黑胡椒的組合. 隨酒杯附上的是一塊黑嘛嘛的海綿蛋糕, 一口酒 一口蛋糕 蠻奇妙的體驗. 這杯酒感偏重, 基酒是威士忌. 這杯比較沒有中我, 但創意用心程度滿分.

店內的員工們都很專業, 喜歡喝甚麼 不了解甚麼 他們都能信手捻來的介紹每款酒的特色跟口感. 覺得很加分~ 因為真的太多酒款跟組合是外面看不到的, 若沒有他們的詳細解說真的會比較難選擇.

最後的最後! 我需要大力推薦 店內所販賣的”阿嬤手工祖傳炸醬麵”!!!
超級無敵好吃! 就算是吃完晚餐才過去喝酒的我, 完全可以一個人完食一整晚的程度!
嫌度偏高, 所以搭配酒很平衡. 手工粗麵條的嚼勁非常彈牙, 真的是念念不忘!
雖然調酒搭配炸醬麵聽起來很突兀!

I like the decoration atmosphere of this shop mysterious and calm
It is strongly recommended to book a place!
Personally, I think that the small disadvantage is that the low -end holidays NTD 800/Person should pay a little attention.
If there is food, it is easy to meet the standards.
But if you simply order wine, pay attention, because Pine's wine is delicious and real! Really means that the base wine is very sincere, and it will not feel like a lot of water dilution. Not good ~ easy to get drunk. Haha

Harvard Cooler of Pine Classic Cocktail Personal Super Recommended Pine Classic Cocktail -Taking Apple Golden Bailan as the base, with Lim and soda. It seems simple to hear, but it is very refreshing and very good.
In addition, the drink you drink is Signature Cocktail (the theme this time is the Taiwan market) ordered a glass of white sesame/kumquat/black pepper. With the wine glass, a black sponge cake is attached. A wonderful experience. This glass of wine is focused, and the base wine is whiskey. This cup is relatively self -sized, but the creativity is full.

The employees in the store are very professional. If they like to drink whatever they know, they can introduce the characteristics and taste of each wine. I feel that it is very bonus ~ Because there are really too many wines and the combination If there is no detailed explanation, it will really be difficult to choose.

In the end! I need to highly recommend the ""Grandma handmade ancestor fried sauce noodles"" sold in the store !!!
Super invincible and delicious! Even if I have been drinking after dinner, I can eat a whole night!

是不是可能在未來可以採取分流的方式，每半小時一批客人之類的，不僅可以讓外場的服務更到位更精緻，也能消化內場做菜的壓力，同時增加內場的人力才能有效解決現況，才能夠在內外場都能更潤滑，在生意好的同時還能做到這點的餐廳基本都是一些有規模的飯店，我個人是很喜歡這裡氛圍跟用餐以及你們的服務，希望你們更好，也希望你們生意更好！","The following is my little suggestion. I can understand my message.

這是我在台北最喜歡的酒吧。這些雞尾酒具有真正的個性，每種雞尾酒都是透過不同層次的風味精心策劃的獨特體驗。這項服務非常友好，讓您感到賓至如歸。店主知識淵博而且很有耐心。她會解釋您可能想知道的飲料的每個細節，您可以解釋您的口味，她或其他調酒師和服務員會給出建議。食物也很棒。爆米花雞是一定要嘗試的。,"This is my favorite bar in Taipei.These cocktails have real personalities, and each cocktail is a unique experience carefully planned through different levels of flavor.This service is very friendly, making you feel at home.The owner's knowledge is profound and patient.She will explain every detail of the drink you may want to know.

"台北是個逛酒吧的好地方，我們匆匆遊覽的第一晚就選擇了大安區的鬆鬆酒吧。使用Open Table應用程序，我們無需台灣電話號碼即可輕鬆預訂，這對旅客來說很方便。

對於葡萄酒鑑賞家來說，吧台座位是必須的！您可以近距離欣賞熟練的調酒師，他們為每個季節提供新鮮的飲料菜單，令人期待。

我們每個人都點了一杯招牌雞尾酒：
🍸 綠花千層酥 / 韭菜 / 丸山靜岡抹茶
🍸 野薑花/紅心番石榴/鹹蛋黃

兩種雞尾酒都層次分明，給人留下了深刻的印象！這裡的食物也很出色。雖然菜色不多，但每道菜都經過精心準備，令人驚喜。尤其值得一提的是香煎鴨胸肉搭配芥末豆芽（新台幣580元）和台灣傳統炸醬麵（新台幣280元），均採用新鮮食材，精心烹調。

打算去台北旅遊的朋友們，記得收藏Bar Pine松吧！體驗美酒、美味佳餚和難忘的夜晚。","Taipei is a good place to visit the bar. On the first night we hurriedly visited the Songsong Bar in Da'an District.Using the Open Table application, we can easily book the phone number of Taiwan, which is convenient for passengers.

For wine appraisers, the bar seat is necessary!You can appreciate the skilled bartender at close range, and they provide fresh beverage menu for each season, which is expected.

Each of us ordered a cup of signature cocktails:
Green Flower Thousand Layers / Leek / Maru Mountain Shizuoka Matcha
心 心 🍸 🍸/red heart guava/salted egg yolk

Both cocktails are clearly layered, leaving a deep impression on people!The food here is also excellent.Although there are not many dishes, each dish is carefully prepared, which is surprising.It is particularly worth mentioning that the fried duck breast meat with mustard bean sprouts (NT $ 580) and Taiwan's traditional fried noodles (NT $ 280) are carefully cooked with fresh ingredients.

創辦人/老闆 Ariel 非常友好，解釋了雞尾酒菜單背後的靈感，並深入介紹了每種雞尾酒的風味特徵。起司拼盤裡有牛奶起司，很特別，絕對值得一試。,"The founder/boss Ariel is very friendly, explaining the inspiration behind the cocktail menu, and introducing the flavor characteristics of each cocktail.There is a milk cheese in the cheese platter, which is very special and is definitely worth trying.",False,0.305,0.0,0.695,0.9258

這裡的氣氛很好。我確實了解大多數酒吧都有每人最低消費。然而，有點尷尬的是，我們覺得雞尾酒沒有那麼美味，所以我們點了第二杯。因此，有點被迫點餐以實現最低費用。而且，我知道之後可能會有預訂，但是工作人員很快就清理了桌子並帶來了賬單等等......有點咄咄逼人，但並沒有讓我們感覺良好。如果我在城裡有朋友，不會推薦這個地方。,"The atmosphere here is very good.I do know most of the bars to have the minimum consumption.However, it is a bit embarrassing that we feel that cocktails are not so delicious, so we ordered the second cup.Therefore, it is forced to order meals to achieve the lowest cost.Moreover, I know that there may be reservations in the future, but the staff quickly cleaned the table and brought the bills ...

週末晚上很吵。座位相當擁擠，兩個人的座位擠滿了三個人。當我們分成兩個三人小組時，幾乎聽不到朋友的聲音。如果你想要一個涼爽的地方，不推薦。飲料很好而且很有趣，但可能只適合安靜的夜晚。,"The weekend evening is very noisy.The seat was crowded, and the seats of the two were crowded with three people.When we divided into two three -person groups, we couldn't hear the voice of friends.If you want a cool place, it is not recommended.The drink is very good and interesting, but it may only be suitable for quiet nights.",False,0.113,0.0,0.887,0.5965

這其實是我第一次寫點評。我經常光顧台北的酒吧，通常都玩得很開心。這其實是我第一次在酒吧經歷如此不愉快的經驗。不僅飲料充其量只是平庸，而且他們也不讓我坐在我女朋友旁邊，儘管桌子之間有足夠的空間（實際上我也很苗條，沒有 200 多磅）。我們旁邊的桌子也不介意我坐在那裡，因為我們之間有足夠的空間（即使他們的包包放在那裡，如圖所示）。我覺得很奇怪的是，我們旁邊的桌子可以放他們的包包，而我卻不能坐在我女朋友旁邊，因為我佔用的空間比他們的包包還要少。然而，女服務員讓我（兩次）換到對面的座位，這實際上有點擋住過道，當人們在過道上行走時，我總是被撞到。我真的很想喜歡這個酒吧，但他們奇怪的規定/服務和低於標準的飲料毀了我在這裡的經歷。即使朋友付錢讓我去，我也不會再回去了，哈哈,"This is actually the first time I have written reviews.I often patronize the bar in Taipei, and I usually play well.This is actually the first time I have experienced such an unpleasant experience in the bar.Not only is the drink at best, but they do not let me sit next to my girlfriend. Although there is enough space between the tables (in fact, I am also slim, without more than 200 pounds).The table next to us didn't mind me sitting there, because there was enough space between us (even if their bags were placed there, as shown in the figure).I feel strange that the table next to us can put their bags, but I can't sit next to my girlfriend, because I take up less space than their bags.However, the female waiter asked me (twice) to change to the opposite seat, which was actually a bit blocking the aisle. When people walked on the aisle, I was always hit.I really want to like this bar, but their strange regulations/services and beverages lower than standards have ruined my experience here.Even if my friend pays me, I will not go back again, haha",False,0.085,0.079,0.837,0.3259
