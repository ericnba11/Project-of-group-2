闆娘超親切，音響不錯，弘音金嗓的歌都有，環境清幽，客人單純，程度偏高，站在舞台上唱歌，會有一面大鏡子，舞台前有個小舞池！唱一整天才300元，是個極佳的練歌場地！,"Ban Niang is super kind, has good audio, and there are songs of Hong Yinjin's voice. The environment is quiet, the guests are simple, and the degree is high. Standing on the stage to sing, there will be a large mirror. There is a small dance floor in front of the stage!Singing for a whole day is only 300 yuan, it is an excellent training venue!",False
