中間餐點跟酒精都很👌，還是有亞洲著名調酒的level，但bar tenders 在回答客人問題並不是有到那個level，可能年輕，可能教育訓練不足，但我認為教育訓練不足的可能性居高。

點了甚麼吃了什麼喝了什麼就不贅述，吃的確實不怎麼樣，在東區這個一級戰區，我認為只是及格邊緣。重點是我們七點進來消費，到九點時一位男生來跟我們說時間差不多了，要我們結帳，然後第四還第五杯酒才剛到，這邊重點是，21:00來跟我們說時間差不多，21:03一位不知道是男生還是女生的服務員就過來操著不太禮貌趕人的語氣跟我們說，後面的訂位已經到了，你們如果有限制，我會建議不要只說訂位系統有說就草草了事，可以在帶位時提醒，或是時間快到前一點時間，你今天是有上過雜誌，有被人家評比是優良的店家，結果你基本的服務態度根本完全沒有，我就不說還聽到那個男生還是女生的用對講機說什麼就趕他們走這樣的對話了。

In the first -class war zone in the East District, I think it’ s just the edge of the grid.The point is that we came in for consumption at seven o'clock. At 9 o'clock, a boy came to tell us that the time was almost the same. We asked us to check out, and then the fourth cup of wine just arrived.

No at all, I don't say that I still heard that the boy or the girl said what to say with what they said.

Today, if your service staff at the scene is the boss, shareholders, and relatives of the boss, I can do it. Anyway, you will bear the loss of surplus. If you are just invited employees today, I can only say that your boss is really pitiful because With your own good and evil, you decide the quality of service to customers.

----------
【鮮蒜脆薯】
蒜味非常強烈，就算加了松露醬（要加錢）也沒有太大的改變，建議原味食用即可。

【再辣也沒你辣】
這道菜就是炸墨西哥辣椒，味道並不會太辣，但卻是酸的……對不愛酸的我而言有點雷。

【炸杏鮑菇】
撒上鹹蛋黃粉的炸杏鮑菇，是當天的特別下酒菜，很好吃。

【南洋燒番雞肉串】
搭配濃重的香料與沙茶，調味是不錯，但沒什麼肉。

【季節烤時蔬】
烤蔬菜的甜味和微酸的醬料很搭，很不錯。

【煙燻炙燒烤花枝】
花枝大約六至七分熟，口感很軟嫩，煙燻風味不是很重，可以要求烤熟一點，我比較喜歡熟一點的口感。每次撒的裝飾花瓣也不太一樣。

【直火羽下牛肉串】
翼板一個過熟就會杯具，幸好這裡的牛肉處理得很鮮嫩，搭配胡椒粗鹽或辣醬食用絕讚，我比較喜歡只沾鹽食用。

【炭烤肋眼腓力】
半熟的牛肉鮮嫩多汁，可搭配鹽、醬料或醬汁食用，而我喜歡配玫瑰鹽。這半熟的牛肉可謂嬌豔欲滴啊，吃起來則是既軟且嫩。

【韃靼生牛肉】
首先端上來是這樣，麵包 + 生牛肉 + 生蛋黃，食用方式是做成普切塔（Bruschetta，一種義式開胃小菜）。之後服務人員會直接搗碎生牛肉和蛋黃、再置於麵包上，合體成普切塔後就可以直接拿著吃了，生牛肉很新鮮不會腥，我很喜歡。

【香蒜辣椒義大利麵】
雖然是蒜辣口味的義大利麵，但加了很多起司粉，味道還不錯。在裝飾上使用了新鮮花瓣，但看起來還是有點單調，不過看到有溫泉蛋我就心花怒放了（笑）。

【泰式打拋豬義大利麵】
意外地不錯吃，既鹹且辣的重口味料理，加入糯米椒也別有創意。

【泰Cho海鮮燉飯】
烹調方式很義式，米芯微硬，風味則是帶點微酸和蝦皮味的泰式風味，蝦子大塊且彈牙，透抽軟嫩，整體不錯吃。

【鹹酥軟殼蟹義大利麵】
最初上桌時軟殼蟹還很完整，隨後服務人員會現場直接將軟殼蟹剪塊，方便食用；青醬的滋味頗清新，軟殼蟹外酥內軟且份量不少，兩者相得益彰，是一道重口味的料理。

【巧克力布朗尼＆香草冰淇淋】
擺盤很前衛，巧克力和冰淇淋的品質都很好。

【檸檬塔】
是當天的特別甜點，檸檬風味很新鮮，也很酸，質地很細緻，口感很好。

【印度／坦督里烤雞串】（Asia Street Food & Cocktail特別菜單）
底下是香料醬汁，搭配旁邊的酸奶，很有南洋風，不過吃起來就是很一般的炸雞胸肉，吃著吃著好想買個雞排……

【無酒精飲料】
要開車的友人只能喝果汁了（苦笑）。

【花開千歲子】
著重於堅果的溫潤風味，略帶點蔥油滋味，很神奇。酒感中等。

【至秦果】
甜菜的色澤實在不大像榛果系列，著重於堅果和冬瓜茶風味，酒感輕，上面的爆米花裝飾很可愛。

【黑花青玉】
帶有淡淡烘焙風味，以威士忌風味融合金萱、烏龍與焙茶風味，喝起來還是著重在威士忌的滋味，茶感不明顯，酒感中等。

【黃金果】
果然威士忌和巧克力很搭呢，加了培根挺奇特，但意外還挺適合；酒感中等微重。

【妒忌】
顏色的確是毛豆色，說是毛豆，但除了杯子上裝飾著一顆毛豆以外，整杯喝起來酸酸甜甜，喝完後的尾韻才有毛豆的滋味，酒感中等偏重。

【返老還瞳】
感覺很穩重的呈現方式，著重於麥茶風味、又帶點酸甜，酒感中等。

【液態黑金】
酸甜的滋味中帶有淡淡的咖啡風味，酒感中等偏輕。

【香料之筏】
帶有輕微的胡椒嗆辣風味，滋味微酸微甜，酒感中等。

【昂蒼逃】
看到旁邊的配料，海苔包肉鬆，真心覺得神奇。飲用方法是先咬一口海苔肉鬆再喝一口酒，可以嚐到鹹蛋糕的滋味，真的很神奇；純喝則可喝出油蔥酥風味。酒感中等。

【加百列的呼喚】
著重於奶油風味，又帶點酸甜，據說製作這一杯非常耗時（Bartender表示：請收下我們的青春XD），感謝Bartender啊。
送來時我還愣了一下，想說奶油看起來這麼清爽是不是送錯了？整體看來非常清新淡雅，很不奶油的感覺，滋味卻真的是奶油，令人驚艷，是我的必點酒款。

【十里桂花香】
看起來說是酒，還更像點心；這杯有陣子嚴重缺料，我去了3次才喝到。滋味酸甜，表面有一層綿密的烏梅奶泡，一旁作為裝飾花的洛神花蜜餞也不錯吃，酒感中等偏重。

【季之花】
酸甜調中偏檸檬酸，帶有濃郁季之美琴酒的風味與香氣，酒感中等偏輕。

【海上花】
帶有淡淡的菊花風味，微酸微甜很清爽，酒感輕，金黃澄澈，很漂亮，是我的常點酒款。

【島嶼之海】
我雖然不喜歡泥煤威士忌，但這杯的風味組合意外不錯，偏酸，帶有松露香氣與微鹹滋味，酒感中等。

【皇室的靜默】
偏酸，雖說是烏龍茶酒，但沒什麼茶感，反倒是一旁附送的餅乾很有烏龍茶感。酒感中等。

【天香雲外】
偏甜，著重於微微的茉莉花風味，酒感中等；上面的花朵可以食用，不過吃起來沒什麼味道。

【高湛塔】
我真的問Bartender：你們去哪裡找來這麼莊嚴的酒器啦（笑），而且還倒了4次才喝完，是瓶子容量大還是杯子容量小還是以上皆是啦（汗）。回到味道，這杯真的是又酸又苦又喝不出哪裡有九層塔，而且一直倒都倒不完，我喝得心好累（淚）。酒感中等偏重。

【植物學家的22個春天】
在酒中滴入了精油，在酸甜中更添羅勒甜味與香氣，整體呈現草本質調，酒感中等。

【英倫女爵】
著重於威士忌和藍莓風味，相當不錯，酒感中等偏重。

【白玉琴紳】
很酸 + 很甜 + 香水香，尾韻的苦味倒是比較像苦瓜，酒感中等偏輕。

【西域雲端】
色澤很小黃瓜，也著重於清淡的黃瓜風味，滋味偏甜，上面還覆蓋著燒融的棉花糖，酒感輕。

【蟠桃宴】
著重於水蜜桃風味，酒感輕，呈漸層般的粉橘色。

【Earl Grey Tea Martini】
雖說是紅茶茶酒，但茶感很輕，酒感中等偏重。

【Cocody Rock - Past】（特別客座酒單）
是泰國的客座Bartender的限定特調，超像乳酸飲料（笑），肉桂風味濃郁，我很喜歡。

【印度】沐奶茶（Asia Street Food & Cocktail特別菜單）
煙燻 + 伯爵奶茶 + 威士忌
帶有酒感的奶茶，挺像貝里斯奶酒，但沒那麼甜；做好後還放冰箱冰了一下才上桌的。

【招待酒】
偶爾會得到的店家招待品，酒的品質都很棒。","For Bar Mood, I came here in admiration. It is a famous shop opened by the World Bartendian Championship. It is also ranked among the 50BAR in Asia. Each of the bartender inside is as beautiful as art, but the meal is not much. Suitable for a full stall to drink. After drinking with a friend, he ran nearby to eat ramen (sweat).

Bar Mood's meal is not bad, but compared to bartending is really dwarfed, every cup of bartending here is a delicate and beautiful work. No wonder people are the awards. ah.

"不得不說，一進門就被非常貼心又細緻的服務給吸引，服務員帶位，然後就坐，一切都非常順暢！水杯沒有水，桌子稍微亂，也是立刻處理，詢問酒的口味或是食物，也是非常專業應答！晚上九點過後，燈光調暗，音樂聲加大，氣氛營造的非常好！ 這部分真的是滿分！
調酒的部分，不得不說份量真的偏小，冰塊量很大，口味沒有驚艷，算是中上！我們點了四杯，水準都是中上，但是以450元來說，創意部分稍嫌不足，有點偏貴！
餐食的部分，軟殼蟹義大利麵賣相很好，可惜麵條本身味道太鹹，而且蒜味過重，搶掉了青醬的香氣，泰式海鮮燉飯則是吃不出泰式，飯粒過熟，嚐不到Risotto 的米粒心，可惜！炸雞翅好吃，酥而不油！炙燒化枝則是擺盤好看，味道沒有記憶點！甜點只有兩種選擇，檸檬塔或是布朗尼，沒有吸引人點的慾望！
整體來說，以450台幣一杯調酒的價格，可能在調酒的設計和份量上，如果能夠再提升，會更棒！食物部分。可能是否考慮不同的廚房團隊？或是調整一下廚師比較擅長的菜色？ 不然真的蠻可惜的！ 整體氣氛和服務5星！酒4星！食物3星！希望下次再訪能看到更多的進步！","I have to say that as soon as I entered the door, I was attracted by a very intimate and meticulous service. The waiter brought the position, and then sat, everything was very smooth!There is no water in the water cup, and the table is slightly chaotic. It is also dealt with immediately. Ask the taste or food of the wine, it is also very professional to respond!After nine o'clock in the evening, the lights are darkened, the sound of music is increasing, and the atmosphere is very good!This part is really full score!
The part of the bartending part has to be said that the amount is really small, the amount of ice cubes is very large, and the taste is not stunning.We ordered four cups, and the standards were all in the middle, but for 450 yuan, the creative part was slightly not enough, and it was a bit expensive!
For the meal part, the sprout crab's pasta is very good. Unfortunately, the noodles itself tastes too salty, and the garlic taste is too heavy. The rice grains are too cooked and I can't taste Risotto's rice heart, unfortunately!Fried chicken wings are delicious, crisp but not oily!The burning branches are beautiful, and the taste has no memory point!There are only two choices for desserts, lemon tower or Browni, without attractive desire!

"座落在東區巷弄間的低調酒吧，衝著2019年亞洲前50大的稱號前來朝聖，果然並沒有讓我失望，甚至驚艷。
裝潢很舒服，服務態度也很棒，會一直主動關心且會對菜單及酒單作詳細的介紹，酒單也很多元，大部份都是用一種主題，然後用中西文化的比較做出的調酒，非常特別，雖然一杯酒平均400-500，份量也不算多，屬於高單價的酒，但酒絕對符合其價格，首推「加百列的呼喚」，我平常對琴酒味道很反感的人都能愛上這杯調酒，可見調酒師的功力真的了得。
食物方面也都很好吃，配酒都很對味，不過單價也都是偏中高，若有預算考量的建議不要來這邊吃正餐，點幾道當下酒菜的話就好。
整體而言非常推薦，是近期內喝過最棒的酒吧。","The low -key bar in the alley in the East District came to the pilgrimage towards the top 50 in Asia in 2019. It really did not disappoint me or even stunning.

Most of them use a theme. The bartender is very special. Although a glass of wine average 400-500, the portion is not much, it is a high unit price of wine, but the wine is definitely in line with its price. People who are very disgusted can fall in love with this cup of bartending, which shows that the skill of the alcoholics is really good.
The food is also very delicious, and the wine is very good, but the unit price is also high. If there are budget considerations, do not come here to eat meals. If you order a few current wine and vegetables.

今天第一次來 果然名不虛傳👍🏻
餐點、調酒、服務都滿分
價位偏高 不過以東區來說還算可接受

我們今天是約八點後進場的
我原本以為會比較像餐酒館的形式
實際體驗感覺比較接近夜店😂
音樂音量偏大 如果是想聊天聚會的話可能比較不適合～（要靠很近才聽得到講話聲音）
但氣氛很好 客群以情侶佔多數

餐點部分我們點了一個$850 set
含兩串南洋烤雞肉串、炸雞翅、炸薯條 及一份義大利麵（可以任選口味）
套餐建議2人公家 份量比較剛好
薯條可以加價$50有松露沾醬

加價的沾醬反而有點多餘 後來都沒人用🤣

The music volume is too large. If you want to chat with a party, it may not be suitable ~ (You need to hear the speech by it depending on it)

Contains two skewers, fried chicken wings, fries, and a pasta (can be selected for flavor)
Package suggests that 2 people are more commonly used
French fries can increase the price $ 50 with truffle dipping sauce
But I think Bar Mood’s French fries are full enough
Instead of price increase sauce, it is a bit redundant and no one uses it later.

"空幫哇
你們的酒吧評論家上線了

我今天想要分享的是位於我城市的一個隱藏寶藏 - Bar Mood。我親自體驗過的這家酒吧，無疑我會給它五顆星的最高評價。

Bar Mood的調酒技藝絕對是讓人讚嘆不已的。每一款調酒都充分表現出酒質的純淨，它們的調酒師具有極高的專業技能與豐富知識。我曾經點過他們的經典調酒 ""Ramos gin fizz""，結果他的表現依然亮眼，無懈可擊。這種調酒難度很高，需要深厚的調酒技術才能完美製作出來，Bar Mood的調酒師對此的掌控完全超乎我的期待。

而Bar Mood的其他特色調酒也絕對不輸給任何一款經典調酒。我已經是二訪的客人了，幾乎所有酒都嘗過一次。令我驚訝的是，他們的調酒沒有半杯讓我覺得失望的。每一種調酒都各有其特色，各自在口感、風味、酒精濃度以及呈現的視覺效果上達到了一種令人愉悅的平衡。

我個人極力推薦Bar Mood這間酒吧，它提供了我們一個完美的空間，能夠讓我們在繁忙的生活中暫時逃脫，並體驗到美酒與好友間的歡樂。無論你是尋找一個適合和朋友共度美好夜晚的地方，還是想要在一個舒適的環境中獨自品嚐美酒，Bar Mood都是一個不可多得的選擇。我認為，這樣的酒吧無疑讓這個城市因為他們的存在而更加亮眼。","Empty gang wow
Your bar commentator is online

What I want to share today is a hidden treasure in my city -Bar Mood.The bar I personally experienced, I will undoubtedly give it the highest evaluation of five stars.

Bar Mood's bartending skills are definitely amazing.Each bartender fully shows the purity of wine quality, and their bartenders have extremely high professional skills and rich knowledge.I once ordered their classic bartending ""Ramos Gin Fizz"", but his performance was still dazzling and impeccable.This kind of bartending is very difficult, and deep bartending technology is required to be perfectly made. Bar Mood's bartender's control over this is completely beyond my expectation.

And Bar Mood's other specialty bartending is definitely not lost to any classic bartender.I am already the guest of the second visit, and I have tasted almost all the wine once.To my surprise, their bartender did not make me feel disappointed.Each alcohol has its own characteristics, and each has a pleasant balance in the taste, flavor, alcohol concentration and the visual effects presentation.

I personally recommend Bar Mood's bar. It provides us a perfect space that allows us to escape temporarily in a busy life and experience the joy of wine and good friends.Whether you are looking for a place suitable for a good night with friends, or wanting to taste wine alone in a comfortable environment, Bar Mood is a rare choice.In my opinion, such bars undoubtedly made the city more eye -catching because of their existence.",False,0.211,0.026,0.763,0.9949

尼克是一位很棒的房東。

花點時間瀏覽菜單。它是經過深思熟慮創建的，有專門針對每種雞尾酒的完整描述頁面。

我唯一的抱怨是桌子的高度剛好是膝蓋高，這太低了，因為我會常常撞到膝蓋

食物非常好。我討厭擔擔麵，但有人點了，強迫我嚐嚐。驚人的！不傳統，沒有那種霸道的花生醬沙嗲醬。哦，嚐嚐雞湯，它溫暖心靈。","A great cocktail.After seeing them in the Asian 50 Best Bar in Hong Kong, they had to come to their own backyard to try it.

"我仍然不明白烈酒和威士忌的吸引力，但我喜歡在末班車上順便去一家酒吧。而且，台灣現在是新興的威士忌聖地，不去酒吧豈不是很可惜？

我在忠孝復興站附近的酒吧喝了啤酒，步行大約5分鐘到了我前兩天預訂的酒吧。據說它是台灣最早的精釀雞尾酒酒吧之一，今年在亞洲50家最佳酒吧中排名第37位。

和我目前去過的酒吧相比，雖然沒有那麼大，但是有好幾張桌子，並不感覺局促。它可以被視為一個喧鬧、緊張、具有現代氛圍的酒吧。

因為我們是兩個人，所以被安排在吧台的座位，透過玻璃可以看到旁邊是一個實驗室一樣的地方，裡面正在煮東西、做東西。我想這可能是製作雞尾酒原料的地方。

沒有服務費，雞尾酒價格平均在2萬韓元左右，所以我覺得這絕對比韓國有優勢。小吃有很多種，我點了一份，不貴。

我點的配菜是「多像哇」墨西哥辣椒，炸墨西哥胡椒塞滿切達起司。我收到了根據要搭配的雞尾酒的推薦，最後，這是一個很好的決定。

切達起司很好地抑制了墨西哥胡椒的強烈辣味，相反，墨西哥胡椒很好地抑制了切達起司的油膩味。那是一種刺激舌尖的味道，所以我很享受這杯雞尾酒，看起來很順利。

對於雞尾酒，我喝了一種以格雷伯爵茶為基礎的杜松子酒，名為“上帝的禮物”。東方風味將草本香氣與伯爵灰茶的苦味和杜松子酒的乾爽融為一體。

我還從與我聊天的調酒師那裡收到了一杯杜松子酒，這很有意義，因為它是在當地的釀酒廠釀造的。有人告訴我它嘗起來像海洋礦物質，事實確實如此。

它讓我想起清澈的海水和鹽的鹹味。我喝得醉醺醺的，興奮地告訴調酒師，台北最好。","I still don't understand the attractiveness of spirits and whiskey, but I like to go to a bar on the way on the last bus.Moreover, Taiwan is now a new whiskey sacred place. Isn't it a pity not to go to the bar?

I drank beer at the bar near Zhongxiao Fuxing Station and walked for about 5 minutes to the bar I booked two days ago.It is said that it is one of the earliest craft cocktail bars in Taiwan. This year, it ranks 37th among 50 best bars in Asia.

Compared with the bars I have been to, although not so big, there are several tables and do not feel cramped.It can be regarded as a noisy, nervous, and modern bar.

Because we are two people, we are arranged in the seat of the bar. Through the glass, we can see that there is a laboratory next to it. It is cooking and doing things.I think this may be the place where cocktails are made.

There is no service fee, the price of cocktails is about 20,000 won, so I think this is definitely more advantageous than South Korea.There are many snacks, I ordered one, not expensive.

The side dishes I ordered were ""much like wow"" Mexican pepper, and Mexican pepper was full of Checida cheese.I received the recommendation of cocktails I wanted to match. In the end, this is a good decision.

The Check cheese has well inhibited the strong spicy taste of Mexican pepper. On the contrary, Mexican pepper has well suppressed the greasy taste of Cheda cheese.It was a smell of stimulating the tip of the tongue, so I enjoyed this cocktail and looked smooth.

For cocktails, I drank a Du Songzi wine based on Earl Gray tea, called ""God's Gift"".Oriental flavor integrates herbal aroma with the bitterness of the poustone gray tea and the dryness of Du Songzi wine.

I also received a glass of Du Songzi wine from the bartender I was chatting with me, which was very meaningful because it was brewed in the local brewery.Someone told me that it tasted like marine minerals, and it was true.

第一杯是我最喜歡的雞尾酒，亞歷山大。我非常喜歡它。我在雞尾酒吧吃過幾次飯，那家雞尾酒吧不敢寫西曼的評論……但價格一樣嗎？水平相差如此之大，我以為

第二杯時，他們推薦了另一種雞尾酒，有點油膩但很甜——我告訴了他們名字，但我寫不出來……真的，下次我旅行的時候，我就得喝一杯了。筆記本並做筆記。

第三次，我要求另一個具有相同細微差別的推薦，但他說他想不出什麼特別的，並問我是否可以為他做。

我說我理解並接受。這非常好吃。

這時我對簽名很好奇，但因為已經兩點多了，所以我要看下一集，所以我只好出來了。

當我再次訪問台灣時，我打算回來。

7月再次回訪

這次的巡演重點在於簽名。

我在上面的評論中喝的雞尾酒是加百利的呼喚，

我再吃的時候真是太好吃了。

至於食物，不幸的是我這次沒能點任何值得主餐的東西......

我很喜歡菜單上的肉，包括 6 塊烤牛肉和莫吉托。

因為之前說的第二家店提供雞肉拉麵，所以菜單上有作為拉麵基礎的湯，所以我點了它。

雖然有一些中國風味的香料，但我認為這是一道味道濃鬱的令人愉悅的小吃。

我點的Alexander勾起了上次的回憶，吃起來還是好吃。

奇怪的是，我看到了一些上次沒有的特別的東西。

其中有一款與獨立威士忌裝瓶公司 Signatori 合作生產的波本威士忌。

所討論的波本威士忌可以單獨食用，但最後有一種獨特的、爆裂的味道。

如果你喜歡這種香味，這會很好，但如果你不喜歡，如果你把它當作高球來吃，味道會更好。

The first cup is my favorite cocktail, Alexander.I like it very much.I have eaten several times in the cocktail bar. That cocktail bar dare not write Siman's comment ... But the price is the same?The level is so different, I think

In the second cup, they recommended another cocktail, a bit greasy but very sweet -I told them their names, but I couldn't write it ... Really, I had to drink a cup next time I tried.Take notes and take notes.

For the third time, I asked another recommendation of the same slight difference, but he said he couldn't think of any special, and asked me if I could do it for him.

I said I understand and accept.This is very delicious.

At this time I was curious about the signature, but because it was more than two o'clock, I had to watch the next episode, so I had to come out.

When I visited Taiwan again, I planned to come back.

Visit again in July

The focus of this tour is signature.

The cocktail I drank in the comments above is the call of Gabeli,

It's so delicious when I eat it again.

As for the food, unfortunately, I haven't ordered anything worthy of the Lord's meal this time ...

I like the meat on the menu, including 6 pieces of grilled beef and Mogito.

Because the second store mentioned before providing chicken ramen, there is a soup on the menu as a ramen foundation, so I ordered it.

Although there are some Chinese flavors, I think this is a pleasant snack.

The Alexander I ordered the last memories, which was delicious.

Strangely, I saw something that did not have last time.

One of the Bobbon whiskey produced with SIGNATORI, an independent whiskey company.

The discussion of the Bourbon whiskey can be eaten alone, but in the end there is a unique, bursting flavor.

If you like this fragrance, this will be fine, but if you don't like it, if you eat it as a high ball, the taste will be better.

服務人員總體上很友好，樂於助人，但飲料主要是很花哨的。與其他酒吧不同的是，與經典雞尾酒相比，他們的奇特雞尾酒是「更安全」的選擇。舉個例子：我們點了他們經典部分的內格羅尼，無論是視覺上還是口感上，金巴利的含量都太多了，橙皮既沒有被修剪，也沒有被去除。這種聽起來很花俏的飲料（忘記叫什麼了，因為所有東西都有華麗的名字）出奇地好得多。但另一種煙燻雞尾酒卻被肉桂壓倒了。大多數飲料都有複雜的元素，例如加入茶/香草/水果的烈酒、豆奶等——猜猜這是台北的持續趨勢？說得複雜一點，就是這樣。站立吧台區域經過深思熟慮（如果您有外套/包，櫃檯下有架子和架子）。就廚房的氣味而言，裡面的座位區有點難以忍受。不需要特意去參觀這個地方。,"The service staff is generally friendly and helpful, but the drinks are mainly fancy.Unlike other bars, their peculiar cocktails are ""safer"" choice than classic cocktails.For example: We ordered Nigrani, the classic part of them. Whether it is visually or in taste, there are too many Jinbari. The orange peel is neither trimmed nor removed.This kind of fancy drink (forgot what is called, because everything has gorgeous names) is much better.But another smoky cocktail was overwhelmed by cinnamon.Most drinks have complex elements, such as the spiritual wine, soy milk, etc. that add tea/vanilla/fruits -guess this is the continuous trend of Taipei?That's complicated, that's it.Standing in the bar area is thought -provided (if you have a coat/bag, there are racks and shelves under the counter).As far as the smell of the kitchen is concerned, the seat area inside is a bit unbearable.No need to visit this place deliberately.",False,0.105,0.0,0.895,0.9371

週四晚上10點到達這裡，被告知因為是聖誕節前一周，所以裡面坐每人最低收費新台幣1000。否則我們就必須站在沒有暖氣的戶外區域。我們很累，所以我們就同意了，因為我們只想在回家之前喝一杯。

首先，哪一家餐廳的最低消費是1000 ！我以前從未聽說過這個。即使在世界各地最高檔的餐廳或高檔酒吧酒廊中，Bar Mood 也絕對不在其中。看起來像是一種短視的搶錢嘗試，因為那是“聖誕節前一周”，給我留下了真正可怕的味道。說真的，台灣「聖誕節前一週」就強制每人最低收費1000元，這是什麼道理？

其次，如果您確實堅持要求最低數量為 1000，那麼至少將其設定為僅在高峰時段。週四晚上 10 點（整個晚上直到凌晨 1 點）不會受到影響，此時餐廳的座位還不到一半。

除此之外，服務很糟糕，飲料每份400，味道平淡，氣氛無菌，一點也不專業。一杯 400 美元的飲料（不包括 10%）我會期望更多。在其他地方可以獲得更好的寶貴經驗！強烈不推薦。","Extraordinary institutions.Can't comment on food, but if it is like their drinks, it will be boring, the taste is thin, and the price is too high

First of all, which restaurant's minimum consumption is 1000!I have never heard of this before.Even in the highest -end restaurants or high -end bars and lounges around the world, Bar Mood is definitely not among them.It looks like a short -sighted try to grab money, because it is ""one week before Christmas"", leaving me a really terrible taste.Seriously, Taiwan's ""before Christmas"" forced a minimum fee of 1,000 yuan per person. What is the reason?

Secondly, if you do adhere to the minimum request to 1000, then set it at least at the peak period.At 10 pm on Thursday (until 1 am), it will not be affected. At this time, the restaurant's seats are less than half.
