"在家裡附近開很久的居酒屋
吃完真的是覺得太晚才來拜訪了
實在很屌打外面很多居酒屋
份量十足外價錢CP值超高味道完全不馬虎

所有食材都很新鮮烤物很多汁
食物沒有短板
但所有的都是現做的所以時間會需要等一下
好的東西都值得等待😋

環境非常乾淨舒適

老闆在一開始就會說：至少要等40分鐘喔
好在沒有被勸退 吃到好吃的就是開心！","The izakaya opened near home for a long time
I really feel too late to visit after eating
It's really a bit of outer izakaya
The portion is full, the price CP value is super high, the taste is not sloppy at all

All ingredients are very fresh, grilled, many juice
Food has no shortcomings
But everything is done now, so time will need to wait a minute
Good things are worth waiting for

The environment is very clean and comfortable

The boss said at the beginning: At least 40 minutes
Fortunately, the one who has not been dismissed to eat delicious is happy!"
"意外發現的店～～
裡面很多老闆佈置的小巧思 很可愛
重點我們點的東西也都好好吃
尤其櫛瓜怎麼有辦法做到咬下去水分爆開
（真的不誇張好吃）
還有水蓮也炒得很香
整體來說Cp值真的很高😍😍
我們聊天聊到很晚 老闆也沒有趕客
真的是很舒服的一家店 大推","An accidental shop ~~
Many bosses in it are cute and cute
The key points we ordered are all delicious
In particular, how can there be a way to bite the water and explode
(Really exaggerated delicious food)
And water lotus also fry very fragrant
On the whole, the CP value is really high
We chat and chat very late, the boss didn’t catch the guests
It's really a very comfortable shop push"
"店家位在台北內湖地區康寧路一段上，店家剛好位在兩個捷運站之間，從內湖或文德捷運站步行過來大約需要10分鐘左右的時間，如要搭公車，最近的公車站為湖光市場站。附近道路狹小，建議騎機車前來，路邊有機車停車格。如要開車的話可以停在成功路上的收費停車場或是路邊停車格再步行過來。店家內部裝潢非常有日式風格，以日式小物或酒瓶裝飾一整面牆，非常有道地的日式居酒屋氣氛，店內座位不算多，多為四人桌座位，如人數較少可以坐吧檯座位。店家用餐時對非常熱門，如要前往強烈建議要事先訂位。用餐人數眾多時，因餐點現點現做，可能會需要等候30~40分鐘左右餐點才會上桌。畫完單後收後結帳即可，飲料自取。
店家為日式居酒屋，主打超級新鮮的日式海鮮料理、串燒、熱炒等菜色。首推午仔魚一夜干，店家特別風乾較久的時間，所以午仔魚的風味更為濃厚，加上烤功了得，魚皮與魚鰭烤的非常酥脆，部分魚骨甚至可以直接咬碎，有著酥脆的口感，魚肉還是非常鮮嫩多汁，富有午仔魚的油脂香氣，真的是必點菜色，如果魚比較小隻價錢會算比較便宜一些。比目魚系列的握壽司與手卷也千萬不要錯過，餐點都是現點現做，握壽司的米飯帶有一點點微溫，不會生冷帶硬，吃起來非常鬆軟卻還吃得出粒粒分明的米粒，上面的比目魚份量超爆多，幾乎是外面握壽司的3倍份量，一口吞下油脂透過嘴巴的溫度融化比目魚的油脂與微溫的米粒融合油脂香氣瞬間竄出，吃起來超級滿足美味，如果加上蟹膏，吃起來則帶有一點點淡雅的鮮味，也是不錯的選擇。酥炸軟殼蟹外表香酥，軟殼蟹帶有濃郁鮮味，吃起來不會有油炸過後的油膩。手切雞軟骨撒上了胡椒鹽，吃起來超級下酒。味噌雞腿串上面加了濃郁的味噌醬，口味比較偏鹹一點，醬燒雞腿串則是帶有恰到好處的醬香，值得一嚐。烤蔬菜或是炒菜等餐點也都表現得不錯。
店家提供美味的日式料理，舉凡握壽司、手卷、串燒、熱炒等餐點都有一定的水準。這裡的海鮮超級新鮮，份量超多，絕對不會讓人失望，午仔魚一夜干、比目魚系列料理更是不能錯過，用料非常實在，價位卻非常平價。只是如果瞬間湧入用餐人潮，餐點與座位可能都會需要等候，但等待是非常值得的。如果來到內湖地區，不趕時間，想要找個地方吃吃串燒、握壽司等日式料理小酌一下，這裡一定是首選。

料理美味價格實惠，涼拌洋蔥或沙拉類很爽口又大盤，握壽司的生魚片很鮮美，下次會再試試大家推薦的生魚片，

然後當天的餐點pos機出的訂單跟點的訂單竟然有落差；另外餐點上完過了10分鐘我們主動問店家才知道我們日式烏龍麵跟醬燒牛蒡都沒有上菜，日式烏龍麵還沒有點到，白白花了10分鐘。
當天餐點

Then the order from the POS machine on the day of the meal and the order of the point of the POS machine turned out to be a gap; in addition, after 10 minutes of the meal, we took the initiative to ask the shop to know that our Japanese oolong noodles and sauce burned beef are not served. Japanese -style style. The oolong noodles have not been ordered, and it took 10 minutes.

壽司生魚片也cp值很高！
來訪好幾次了！每次必點肥腸、明太子雞腿、盛合生魚片🥰

雖然出菜速度偏慢，但慢活步調不正是我們在忙碌生活中追求的嗎🥰","Recommended izakaya!

"cp值超高的店～
推薦：
1. 避風塘炒雞（很特別的口味，外面吃不到）
2. 炙燒焦糖鮭魚（超級划算，而且鮭魚口感很嫩，整體口味搭配起來超好吃）
3. 蝦頭味噌湯（有4隻蝦頭，還有豆腐跟海帶$60 以台北的物價真的很便宜～～）

裡頭的擺設很有日本的風格，過7點之後人就變很多了，建議提早去排隊（老闆全部自己做，會忙不過來）然後衷心建議不用去看部落客上推薦什麼，憑直覺選就對了！我推薦的都是我那時候自己覺得會好吃的☺️事實是真的很好吃，已經覺得下次去台北還會再回訪❤️","Store with a high CP value ~
recommend:
1. Stir -fried chicken from Fengtang (very special taste, you can't eat it outside)
2. Roasted caramel salmon (super cost -effective, and salmon taste tender, the overall taste is super delicious)
3. Shrimp miso soup (4 shrimp heads, and tofu and kelp $ 60 at Taipei are really cheap ~~)

The furnishings inside have a Japanese style. After 7 o'clock, people will change a lot. It is recommended to go in line early (the boss does all by himself, and you will be too busy) and then sincerely recommend that you do n’t have to look at what the blogger recommends. By the way!What I recommend was that I felt delicious at that time ☺️ The fact is really delicious. I already feel that I will return to visit again next time ❤️"

很有風格的日式居酒屋，不過出餐速度頗慢，需耐心等待。推薦日式炒烏龍，雖然不太像日式，但炒得蠻好吃的。鮮菇高麗菜也蠻有味道，且蔬菜脆度都還在。沙瓦就沒什麼味道，覺得可以再甜一點。,"Very stylish Japanese -style izakaya, but the meal speed is slow, and you need to wait patiently.It is recommended that Japanese -style fried oolong, although not very like Japanese -style, is pretty delicious.Fresh mushroom Korean cabbage is also quite delicious, and the brittleness of vegetables is still there.Salad has no taste, and I think it can be sweeter."
"太好吃了忘記拍照就吃光，真希望我家附近也有一家這樣的居酒屋🥹🥹🥹
炙燒比目魚壽司必點！用料實在，餐點好吃美味！
蝦頭味增湯$60有4隻超大蝦頭，蝦味非常濃厚，推推💕

The shrimp head flavor Zeng soup is $ 60 with 4 oversized shrimp heads, the shrimp flavor is very strong, push push
The sauce, chicken leg meat sauce is sweet, I like it very much!"
"料理美味，服務親切，價格實惠，只可惜從點餐到上菜超過30分鐘，美中不足，否則一定會給五顆星。
涼拌洋蔥很爽口，握壽司的生魚片很鮮美，山葵夠味夠嗆，雞丼飯料多好吃。","The cooking is delicious, the service is cordial, and the price is affordable. Unfortunately, from ordering to serving for more than 30 minutes, the beauty is not enough, otherwise it will definitely give five stars.
The cold onion is very refreshing, the sashimi of the sushi is very delicious, the sunflower is delicious enough, and the chicken rice rice is delicious."
"在地人推薦！住內湖30幾年，每次想吃居酒屋就想到武郎藤～
今天不餓，隨意的點了一些，搭配生啤，真的是好幸福～～
老闆真的好手藝，雖然客人多的時候稍微要等，但是店裡氛圍很舒服，等待都成為一種享受～","Recommended locally!I have lived in Neihu for more than 30 years, and every time I want to eat izakaya, I think of Wulang Teng ~
I'm not hungry today, I ordered a little bit at will. It is really happy to match raw beer ~~
The boss is really good. Although the guests have to wait a little when there are many guests, the atmosphere in the store is very comfortable. Waiting will become a kind of enjoyment ~"
"串燒除了雞肉串之外，個人覺得普通，口感微微偏乾，不過丼飯、生魚片、壽司都很不錯。特別喜歡蟹膏比目魚握壽司，一口吃很滿足。

另外很喜歡沙瓦，沒有很重的酒精味，風味也很好，讓我愛上沙瓦了。適合不嗜酒精者飲用！","In addition to the chicken skewers, I personally feel that it is ordinary and the taste is slightly dry, but rice, sashimi, and sushi are very good.I especially like crab cream than to hold sushi than fish.

In addition, I like Shawa very much. There is no heavy alcohol flavor, and the flavor is also very good, making me fall in love with Salada.Suitable for people who do not have alcoholic sophisticated!"
"好吃的居酒屋！薑絲蛤蜊湯新鮮夠味、握壽司魚肉新鮮厚實、炒高麗菜超香脆、招牌炒烏龍麵大碗好吃超多配料真的很划算，炸雞肉串最是經典美味，每次來必點！蕈菇涼拌豆腐更是清涼美味👍

不過店內整潔狀況不太好，廁所現在有貼木板所以狀況勉強好過之前，之前真的是狹小又不太乾淨~ 店內常常餐桌地上都沒很乾淨，垃圾沒掃，不知道是人手不足還怎樣，可能老闆娘要顧小孩吧。所以夏天地上會看到蟑螂跑來跑去……

不過店內依舊常常高朋滿座，要來要趁早喔！","A delicious izakaya!Ginger clam soup is fresh and delicious, the sushi fish is fresh and thick, the fried cabbage is super crispy, the signature fried oolong noodle big bowl is delicious, and the fried chicken skewers are the most classic and delicious, every time you come, you must order it. IntersectionMushroom cold tofu is even more cool and delicious 👍

However, the neat condition in the store is not very good. The toilet has a wooden board now, so the condition is barely better than before. Before, it was really narrow and not very clean. The restaurant was often not clean on the table and the garbage. Maybe the boss will take care of the child.So when you see cockroaches run around in summer ...

However, the store is still full of friends, and you have to come as soon as possible!"
就氛圍的角度來看，確實是名符其實的大眾酒場。食物的滋味很好，水準以上，用料覺得紮實。老板的小朋友會幫忙端菜跑堂非常的可愛，是令人感動的一家食堂。有機會會再造訪😁 …,"From the perspective of atmosphere, it is indeed a versatile Volkswagen wine farm.The taste of food is very good, above the level, and the ingredients feel solid.The boss's children will help Duancai Run Hall very cute, a moving cafeteria.If you have the opportunity, you will visit again ..."
吃第二次，居酒屋料理，中價位。口味比較重一點，節瓜等醬料重的蠻鹹的。,"Eat for the second time, izakaya cuisine, medium price.The taste is relatively heavy, and the sauce and other sauces are very salty."
"東西真的很好吃，店裡只有老闆跟老闆娘
人手略微不足，不過有兩個老闆可愛的女兒幫忙~ 上菜速度是真的很慢，介意的人請盡量避免人多的時候來吃","The things are really delicious, only the boss and the boss in the store are only the boss and the boss
The person's hand is slightly insufficient, but there are two cute daughters of the boss. The speed of serving is really slow. For those who mind, please try to avoid people from eating"
"非常好吃的居酒屋 大推
雖然餐點要等比較久一點
炸牛蒡非常的酥香，雞肉串完全不柴而且配上蔥醬非常好吃，明太子鮭魚壽司不會膩也不會腥 美乃滋調和的很好，甜蝦壽司蝦子非常的厚實油脂非常足夠 海膽也很鮮甜，烤魷魚也烤的很剛好，炒飯口味偏淡，炸豆皮鹹酥醬很香，比目魚壽司油脂豐富，蛤蜊絲瓜比較一般","Very delicious izakaya push
Although the meal has to wait a little longer
The fried beef bull is very crispy, the chicken skewers are completely not firewood, and it is very delicious with onion sauce. It's fresh and sweet. The grilled squid is also grilled very well. The flavor of fried rice is light. The fried bean skin salty sauce is very fragrant."
"餐點好吃 每個都很驚豔
可以感覺到老闆很用心
一直想回訪👍👍","The meals are delicious and everyone is amazing
You can feel that the boss is very attentive
I always want to return to visit 👍👍"
"店裡裝潢的可愛日式居酒屋。外場是兩個小妹妹顧（大概8歲）。真的缺人也不用這樣吧...食物好吃歸好吃，但是出餐真的很慢，餐點也常送錯或是沒來（因為是一個8歲妹妹點的）。吃到一半小蟑螂就爬到我面前，差點直接升天😊  妹妹幫結帳我們還要幫她算錢因為她快餓昏了🥺

P.S.( 兩個妹妹真的很棒很可愛，小小年紀就幫家裡忙，餐點送錯我也吃了，怕她又被媽媽罵🥺）","The cute Japanese -style izakaya decorated in the shop.There are two younger sisters Gu (about 8 years old) in the field.It ’s really missing people ... The food is delicious and delicious, but the meal is really slow, and the meal is often wrong or did not come (because it is a 8 -year -old sister point).After eating half of the small cockroaches, I climbed in front of me. I almost risen directly to the sky. My sister helped me get the money to help her count money because she was hungry.

P.S. (Two sisters are really good and cute, I am busy at home at a young age."
"當天的酒蒸蛤蜊品質不太好，小顆沒肉也不太新鮮
牛舌略有腥味
鹽烤雞翅好吃","The quality of the wine steaming on the day is not very good, and the small one is not meaty and not very fresh
The beef tongue is slightly fishy
Salt grilled chicken wings are delicious"
人很多，老闆都會告知需要等候多少時間。能等的就耐心等吧！裝潢很多細節可以觀察，雞肉丼跟炒烏龍都不錯。主要是炸物的外皮酥脆好吃！握壽司的新鮮度尚可，但醋飯有點太濕。羊肉串、味噌湯算是相較之下的普通品項了。,"There are many people, and the boss will inform how much time you need to wait.Just wait patiently!Many details can be observed. Chicken ravioli and fried oolong are good.Mainly the skin of the fried object is crispy and delicious!The freshness of the sushi is okay, but the vinegar rice is a bit wet.Lamb skewers and miso soup are compared to ordinary items."
"今天剛好下班路過又剛好老婆生日，經常路過但第一次進來品嚐，出餐雖然不快但就是讓人可以座一個晚上慢慢喝酒吃菜聊天的好地方
因為喜歡拍照，店內外的裝潢比食物更吸引我
很可惜今天是下班直接來吃，下次想帶著相機再吃一次！

店家的女兒們幫忙在我們一家看起來也是大加分，都好乖","Today, I just passed off from get off work and just happened to be my wife's birthday. I often passed by but came in to taste it for the first time. Although the meal is not fast, it is a good place to make people drink slowly for a night.
Because I like to take pictures, the decoration inside and outside the store attracts me more than food
It's a pity that today is to eat directly from get off work, and I want to take the camera again next time!

The daughters of the store helped in our family, it looks like a big bonus, they are all very good"
"裝潢很用心的店家，店裡擺設了非常多來自日本的瓶罐、公仔、招牌...等，店外擺了台賣物品的推車裝飾，很有風味。

週三晚餐，開始營業後人客陸續進來，這是個家庭經營的店，人手較吃緊，老闆的小女兒會幫忙送菜。

兩人用餐沒有點酒水，1150。還有一盤炸豆腐沒有拍了。整體來說，食物味道沒有踩雷，是可以再訪的店。建議店家可以將餐廳整體環境整理打掃乾淨會更加分。少掉的1星不是菜色，是餐廳整體環境。","There are many shops in the store, and there are a lot of bottles, cans, dolls, signboards, etc. from Japan. The trolley decoration of Taiwan -selling items is very flavorful.

On Wednesday dinner, after the business started, the guests came in one after another. This is a family -run shop. The man's hand is tighter. The boss's little daughter will help to deliver food.

The two did not have a drink for meals, 1150.There is also a plate of fried tofu.Overall, the taste of food has not been stepped on, it is a shop that can be visited again.It is suggested that the store can be cleaned up and cleaned the restaurant's overall environment.The less 1 star is not a dish, it is the overall environment of the restaurant."
"五星溫馨大眾酒場 寵物友善🐶🐶

這次是宵夜想喝杯終於有機會來了，點了杯Asahi生啤上的很快也很冰覺得開心，同時也點了生魚片、豆皮壽司來下酒，實在是非常大份，也是蠻實在的好吃，記得生魚片真的是片片新鮮，鮪魚也沒有因為平價而有很煩的筋，而且有花枝實在相當喜歡。最後來個味增湯，應該是紅白味增一起調味，蠻夠味不會太淡也不會太濃，搭配海鮮湯底剛好收尾喝完收工。

內湖湖光市場巷內的溫馨好點，在許多當地小吃的一間喝杯的日式好地方，推推🥳","Five -star warm and popular winery pet is friendly 🐶🐶

This time, I wanted to drink a cup and finally had a chance. I ordered the cup of Asahi to be very happy on the raw beer. At the same time, I also ordered the sashimi and the bean skin sushi. It is also quite delicious. Remember that the raw fish fillets are really fresh, and the catfish does not have a very annoying tendon because of the cheap price, and there is a flower branch that really likes it.In the end, a taste of soup should be added with red and white flavor. It is not too light enough or too strong. The seafood soup base just finished and finished the work.

The warm and good better in the Lake Lake Lake Market Lane."
"真的很舒適的大眾酒場，而且人很多很忙但上菜時間需要等久一點，如果趕時間的人就先預約吧！如果願意慢慢來就超級歡迎！居酒屋上菜本來就沒必要太快，下班放鬆吃晚餐配生啤酒，才是都市裡下班後的節奏。

這家位處湖光市場附近，在眾多居酒屋系列中算是很日式風格的，不管裡外裝飾都很有心，算是在小店內擺滿日式文物，就連廣播都是日文廣播，整體裝潢風格很不錯唷！

晚餐隨便點點品嚐一下，當然炸豆皮最能表現出好不好吃特色的一道菜，一定要點一下來嘗試看看，不得不說還不錯，芝麻香搭配酥脆透徹的豆皮，加上靈魂的醬汁，很有味道。比目魚握壽司是我最愛的一道，這家的比目魚握壽司作法比較不同，口味也是不錯，不過我覺得上引的比目魚更好吃一點。烤秋刀魚的魚肉也算紮實，第一口可以吃原味，再來加胡椒，最後嘗試檸檬入味，三種口感都可以嘗試看看唷！味增湯味道算濃，不過放久會變鹹，所以要趁熱喝。

整體來說味道不差，價格平價，環境還算舒適，下班後三五好友來小酌一番很可以唷！","# #Japanese cuisine #屋 rauka

Near the lake and light market, this is a very Japanese style in many izakaya series. It is very intentional in the inside and outer decoration. It is full of Japanese -style cultural relics in the small shop. Very good!

Sake dinner and taste it casually. Of course, fried bean skin can best show a dish that is good or delicious. Be sure to try it to try it. You have to say that it is good. Juice is very delicious.Bigyu Jianshou is my favorite one. The method of this one -eyed fish grip sushi is relatively different, and the taste is good, but I think it is better than the fish.The fish of roasted autumn saury is also solid. You can eat the original flavor in the first bite, and then add pepper. Finally, try the flavor of lemon. You can try to see all three flavors!The taste of the soup is strong, but it will become salty for a long time, so drink it while it is hot.

Overall, it tastes bad, the price is affordable, and the environment is comfortable. After get off work, three or five friends can have a drink!"
每次經過生意都很好，食材部分都很新鮮，餐點等的比較久但是老闆都會先跟客人說明，所以這餐吃起來也是很滿足喔！老闆的女兒也很可愛！,"Every time I go through the business, the ingredients are very fresh. The meals are relatively long, but the boss will explain to the guests first, so this meal is also very satisfied!The boss's daughter is also very cute!"

"生魚片丼不錯，豆皮最好吃！

相比其他居酒屋，武狼藤這裡每一道菜都做的更精緻些，也許是這樣上菜才比較久。

居酒屋上菜本來就不該太快，下班放鬆吃些精緻的餐食配啤酒，才是都市裡下班後的節奏。","Raw fish slices are good, soy skin is the best!

Compared to other izakaya, every dish here of martial arts vine is more delicate, maybe it is a long time to serve.

It has the ancient taste of Taiwan. The decoration inside is very retro and feels nostalgic.There are many types of meals in the cafeteria, including sashimi, holding sushi, hand rolls, skewers, three or four types of desk -style fried vegetables, salads, miso soups, sake, beer, and salmon fried rice and beans who want to eat or eat.

"個人認為內湖CP居酒屋排名相當前面，雖然老闆只有一人出菜較慢，但東西口味都不馬虎，價錢也是實在；偶爾遇到老闆的小女兒們幫你做小小服務生，在這本來就是有些闔家歡樂的居家屋內，其實還蠻有趣的；,不推薦想喝個酩酊大醉的朋友，或招兵買馬大搞一番的；但好友談心小酌，家庭偶爾來換個口味感覺，的確是不錯的；記得是不能電話訂位，要早點到現場候位喔！","Personally, I think that Neihu CP izakaya rankings are quite ahead. Although only one person has one person who has a slower food, the taste of things is not sloppy, and the price is real; occasionally, the little daughter who meets the boss helps you as a small waiter. Some happy home houses are actually quite interesting; do not recommend friends who want to drink a drunk, or recruit soldiers to buy a horse; Well; remember that you can't book your position, you have to wait early to wait!"
日本風味的在地小店，每一道都好好吃😋氣氛很自在！啤酒也好喝，存成再訪名單 …,"Japanese -style local shops, each of which is delicious!The beer is also good, and it is stored in a re -visit ..."
"氣氛好
餐點也好吃","Good atmosphere
The meals are delicious"
性價比不錯，只是靠門口比較熱，適合3-6人聚餐，東西都好吃但份量少，適合聊天小酌。,"The price / performance ratio is good, but it is relatively hot at the door. It is suitable for 3-6 people to dinner. The things are delicious but the amount is small. It is suitable for chatting."
"絕對五星
先論外觀就非常特別，日式風格裝潢看起來就像到了日本，超級喜歡，內部擺設與裝飾也是超讚，許多招財貓與老招牌！
食物的部分平價美味，感受得到老闆的用心，一定會再回訪。
不過必須說出一個問題，希望老闆雇用一個外場員工吧！女兒年紀太小了，看了好心疼，也很不好意思請她幫忙任何事，變成客人寧願自己來，且當天已經到23點半了，妹妹還在勤勞做事，雖然看起來是個很願意做事的人，不過小妹妹這個年紀應該好好的玩、好好睡覺，看她超齡工作的模樣實在不捨！","Absolute five -star
The appearance is very special. The Japanese -style decoration looks like it is in Japan. It is super favorite. The interior furnishings and decorations are also very happy. Many wealthy cats and old signboards!
Part of the food is delicious and delicious. If you feel the intention of the boss, you will definitely return to visit.
However, a problem must be said, I hope the boss hires an out -of -field employee!My daughter was too young, I was so distressed, and I was embarrassed to ask her to help anything. It became a guest would rather come, and it was 23:30 that day. The sister is still working hard, although it looks like she is willing to do things. People, but the younger sister should play and sleep well at this age, and it is really reluctant to look at her oversized work!"
"店內很小但是裝潢很用心
生魚片很新鮮很甜完全滿分不用懷疑
炒高麗菜也很甜很香很好吃
比較可惜是這邊飲料只有汽水和酒類可以選
沒有水或無糖茶","The shop is very small but the decoration is very careful
Girl fillet is fresh, sweet, full score, no doubt, no doubt
Frying Korean cabbage is also very sweet, fragrant, delicious, delicious
It's a pity that there are only soda and alcoholic drinks here.
No water or no sugar tea"
店內擺設非常精緻，彷彿來到異國，餐點都很美味，老闆人很不錯,"The shop is very delicate, as if coming to a foreign country, the meals are delicious, the boss is very good"
老闆很親切，雖然每次來食物都要很久，但很值得！！很用心的每道料理，無論是生食、烤物或炒菜類都很厲害！無法訂位只能早點來。有次不知道要選擇哪種梅酒，老闆直接請他女兒倒三小杯給我們試喝～,"The boss is very kind. Although it takes a long time to come to the food, it is worth it!IntersectionEach dish is very powerful, whether it is raw, grilled or fried!You can only come earlier.I did n’t know which kind of plum wine to choose. The boss directly asked his daughter to pour three small cups to try to drink ~"
超級推的，手藝有水準之上，餐點老闆很用心，上菜值得耐心等候，優質的店家，值得支持！,"Super pushing, the craftsmanship is above the level, the boss is very attentive, the food is worth waiting for, and the high -quality shop is worthy of support!"
"比ㄧ般居酒屋便宜
但因地方小，廚師少
週五六日，通常要等30分鐘
若不趕時間可嚐試看看","It is cheaper than izakaya
But because of the local small, there are few chefs
On Friday, 6th, it usually takes 30 minutes
If you don't hurry up, try to see"
"動作極慢，肚子很餓的人不建議來吃
食物大部分還行，但壽司的米有夠軟
一夾全部散開..真的有認真在捏嗎?
重點是，在吧台捏壽司的員工
一邊吃東西一邊料理
真的有夠噁心🤮
價位不算便宜，整體cp值低","People who are very hungry are not recommended to eat
Most of the food is okay, but the rice of the sushi is soft enough
A clip is all scattered .. Is there really a serious pinch?
The point is, the employees of sushi pinch at the bar
Cooking while eating
It's really disgusting 恶
The price is not cheap, the overall CP value is low"
"出菜稍緩慢
其餘正常","Slowly dishes
Remaining normal"
"東西好吃～已經來三四次了～
但是最近一次要訂位說直接到現場就好不用訂位有位置，但到了卻要等，三個人硬是坐在兩人座，感覺其實挺不好的🥹還是很喜歡這間店只是有點失望而已","The things are delicious ~ have been here three or four times ~
But the last time I want to make a reservation, just go directly to the scene without any position, but when it comes to the time, the three people just sit in the two -person seat. In fact, I still like it."
"口味比一般台式居酒屋更接近日本國本土口感, 沒有太多可以挑剔, 如果有幾樣明星商品, 就更好了~","The taste is closer to the local native taste of Japan than the general desktop izakaya. There are not too many picky. If there are a few star products, it is even better ~"
適合三四人點多樣一起吃,Suitable for three or four people to eat diverse
沒有什麼比得上在這間店得到的美好經驗，料理美味，待客親切，連小朋友都好會招呼客人，太可愛了！值得推薦，肯定二訪再訪！祝店家新年快樂！,"Nothing is better than getting a good experience in this shop, delicious food, kind hospitality, even children will greet guests, so cute!It is worth recommending, be sure to visit the second visit!Happy New Year to the shop!"
"如果你有看到這則留言，請相信我，吃了你絕對會後悔
食物普通，態度跩個二五八萬，吃的一肚子氣，牛丼很鹹，調味普通到不行，比西湖市場的牛丼還難吃。雞丼超像炸雞便當，高麗菜跟幾個台式的配菜，不簡單。
我們點了味增湯生魚片跟兩個丼飯，等了半個小時什麼菜都沒上，詢問我們的菜什麼時候會上，都還沒開始煮的話可以不用做我們的，裡面的煮飯人員搞不清楚狀況直接大聲嗆，說怎麼可以這樣不吃，不吃不會早點講之類之類的不知道在兇什麼，重點是我們只是詢問，我們到這間店就是想吃，而且味增湯什麼的需要做很久嗎？需要半個小時連個味增湯都不能先出？傻眼，不重視客人感受的店家，極負評","If you see this message, please believe me, you will definitely regret it after eating
The food is ordinary, with an attitude of 250,000 and 80,000, a stomach is breath, the cow is salty, the seasoning is not good, and it is even harder than the cattle in the West Lake market.The chicken is super -fried chicken bento, and it is not easy to go with cabbage and several tabletop side dishes.
We ordered the flavor of Mi Zeng Tang Shengfish and two rice rice. After waiting for half an hour, no dishes were not put. Ask our dishes when it will be cooked, you can cook it without starting to cook it. The meal is unclear and loudly louder, saying how can I not eat it like this, and I do n’t know what to say if I do n’t eat it early. The point is that we just ask about it. We just want to eat it. Do you need to do it for a long time?It takes half an hour to even have a flavor of soup?Stupid, shops that do not pay attention to the feelings of the guests, are extremely negatively reviewed"
接電話的女服務生態度有夠差，講話愛理不理的態度，聽不清楚多問一遍還會跟客人發脾氣，還真是第一次遇到這種怪事,"The ecosystem of the female service who answered the phone was poor enough, and the attitude of being ignored, I couldn't hear it clearly, and I would lose my temper with the guests again. This is the first time I have encountered such strange things."
綜合烏龍麵不錯吃，有種老媽煮的家常菜回憶感覺。肥腸挺推的料大且味道足夠，明太子雞肉串好吃，味道濃郁回味無窮。牛肉感覺還好沒有特別驚豔。缺點大概是酒類選擇感覺有點太少了。算是不錯吃的小店,"The comprehensive oolong noodles are good, and there is a feeling of recalling the home cooked dish with a kind of mother.The fat intestines are pushed up with a large and tasteful taste.The beef feels okay. It is not particularly amazing.The disadvantage is that the choice of wine is a bit too little.It's a good shop that eats good"
"點兩碗牛丼，卻等了50分鐘，在這期間我前面那桌的兩碗鮭魚炒飯和後面的兩盤手捲和兩碗炸蝦飯都上了，摧了三遍都還沒來，直接走人。

8/25更
重點不是這個問題，而是為什麼別桌比我「晚來晚點」的「炸」天婦羅丼都來了，我只是點牛丼而已，為什麼要等那麼久？

更何況我之前來了好說有十次以上都沒有這個狀況，我那天就碰上？

還有，我當天看了兩桌比我晚到10分鐘的都上菜了，就我這桌都空的，別桌點的東西可比我點的多，整個桌子都是滿的。

你說你速率比不上其他店家，可是兩碗牛丼需要做50分鐘？？？？？

真的太誇張了。","Ordered two bowls of beef, but waited for 50 minutes. During this period, the two bowls of salmon fried rice in front of the table in front of me and the two bowls of hand rolls and two bowls of fried shrimp rice in front of me were put on. Walk.

8/25 more
The point is not this problem, but why do n’t do the “fried” tempura of “fried” that is “late late” than me. I just have some cow. Why do you have to wait so long?

What's more, I have come to say that there are no more than ten times before. I met this day?

Also, I watched two tables on the same day and was served as 10 minutes later than me. I was empty at this table. The things at the table were more ordered than me. The whole table was full.

You said that you are not as good as other stores, but you need to do 50 minutes for two bowls of cattle?IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection

It's really exaggerated."

"菜上很慢，只有一組客人菜可以花3,40分上。師傅的手全年復健中，握壽司的飯都沒捏緊，一夾就散。附近的澄食小人屋隨便都贏他","The dishes are very slow, only one group of guests can spend 3,40 points.In the rehabilitation of the master's hand all year round, the sushi rice was not pinched, and it was scattered.The nearby Chengshi House has won him casually"

But I often wait until the fire is big, take a sushi for an hour and not exaggerate (the guest is only me), the normal movement is slow"
附近的常客，連續吃兩年多了，但近期品質下降很多，餐點常常漏做，或是等很久（半小時）詢問之後才說還沒做，雖然夫妻倆邊帶孩子邊做生意挺辛苦的，但，想長久經營的話，希望改善一下用餐品質，不然控管一下用餐人數吧…,"The nearby frequent customers have been eating for more than two years, but the quality has decreased a lot in the near future. The meal often missed, or after asking for a long time (half an hour), she said she had not done it yet. However, if you want to run for a long time, I hope to improve the quality of dining, otherwise the number of meals is controlled ..."
超好吃！ 但是建議老闆收錢完可以用肥皂洗手不是只是清水洗手這樣製作生食比較衛生,"Super delicious!However, it is recommended that the boss can use soap to wash your hands after receiving money."
店內氣氛佳，食物好吃。不過店內會有狗走來走去並且可憐兮兮的盯著你看討食物，和店家反應過後店家沒有處理，可能是店長的朋友。怕狗的人在店內用餐要三思(有提供外帶),"The atmosphere in the store is good and the food is delicious.However, there will be dogs walking around and staring pitifully at you to discuss food. After responding to the store, the store may not be dealt with. It may be friends of the manager.Those who are afraid of dogs should think twice in the store (there are take -off)"
