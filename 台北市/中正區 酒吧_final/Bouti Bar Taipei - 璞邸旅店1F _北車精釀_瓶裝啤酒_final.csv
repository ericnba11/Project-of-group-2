"地點在北車M8出口附近（墊腳石書局旁邊），是一件位在旅館一樓的酒吧（看起來是提供給住宿的旅客使用為主，對外可能比較還好，店裏的限制低消每人是新臺幣200元，酒單除了精釀啤酒、基本的highball、長島冰茶之外，也有自己特色調酒（但沒有特別華麗的杯盤，跟其他一半調酒用的是一樣的杯子），也有提供像是黑麥汁、果汁及碳酸飲料等無酒精的軟性飲料，我們七位各點了一到兩杯調酒，還有一個綜合炸物拼盤（$499），付款是後結，差不多三千塊左右。

Seven of us have ordered one or two cups of bartender each, and a comprehensive explosive platter ($ 499). About three thousand yuan.

店裡氣氛不錯，但是酒單上的酒有一半沒有也沒表示在酒單上，服務員龜在一邊用電腦，也只會面無表情機械應答，體驗相當糟糕，不推。,"The atmosphere in the store is good, but half of the wine on the wine list did not say that on the wine list.
