這次冷前菜點了
紅甘魚底部有著透明的番茄澄清果凍酸酸的完全沒腥味只有新鮮，慢烤章魚肉質很軟嫩紅堅果醬好搭，滿驚豔的忍不住白酒再一杯🤭
還有一份煙花女炒海鮮的Casarecce 麻花捲麵料超多番茄醬汁味道很適宜不會太酸太重清香很舒服的口味，但需要預定。
最後是爐烤帶骨牛肉小排。旁邊的時蔬有淡淡的奶油香，牛肉軟嫩到不行，吃了好幸福搭配是義大利的紅酒～完全超搭差不多升天。
最後點了4杯新品調酒🍹
特巴奇鐵觀音🍵
基酒蘭姆酒 口味有鳳梨和鐵觀音尾韻有些許苦味，酒感輕鬆滿適合當第一杯。
蘋果焦化奶油🧈
蘋果白蘭地 焦化奶油 聞起來有牛奶糖的香氣，比較甜口，感覺很適合餐後像甜點一下。
洋甘菊烏龍🍵
基酒蘭姆酒 有洋甘菊 烏龍 金桔的氣息
這杯我自己挺喜歡的，口感偏酸，烏龍茶尾韻很耐喝。
最後是挑戰一點的

"很精緻也很舒適的用餐經驗。

趁平日約了友人來享用，點餐方式就是可以搭配一個主食，若不搭配就是純用自助吧。

點餐時，服務人員會清楚且中肯的給出建議，比如：某主餐份量大，建議一起享用之類的。也會觀察每桌客人的用餐情況，適時的提供詢問跟服務，比如，當桌上的飲料喝剩1/3，會來問是否需要加點。

食物方便，新鮮是一定的，口味也都很符合，今日點的戰斧豬排超嫩，搭配的胡蘿蔔泥好好吃。

甜點也是頗有水準，各式冷盤也不錯。

雖然少了熱食與海鮮等，但價格比起假日便宜，且對我們而言，主食搭配半自助的份量剛剛好。","Very delicate and comfortable dining experience.

For example, when the drinks on the table drink 1/3, you will ask if you need to add points.

Food is convenient, fresh is certain, and the taste is also very consistent. Today, the Tomahawk pork chop is super tender, and the carrot mud is delicious.

Desserts are also quite standard, and all kinds of cold disks are also good.

"必須說，能在東方文華開下來的店家肯定是有一點厲害之處。
前菜炸雞翅一入口就可以知道不是外面那種冷凍雞翅的調味，特殊的醃料配上辣美乃滋，表現非常不錯。
炸豬排三明治的豬排非常厚，多汁，第戎芥末讓油炸的口感被提升得更清爽，完全沒想到會是這樣的口感和體驗。美中不足是豬排裡的筋沒有挑乾淨或是切肉的走向問題會偶爾有咬不斷的情況，稍稍減分。
松露燉飯裡的菇類很多，松露味濃郁，切在飯上擺盤用的雞翅有點好笑不過無傷大雅吧。
接下來提服務跟氛圍，我們定位在十一點，十一點到現場後入座。入座後只有另一組客人，我們早早點完餐在現場機會沒有其他客人、我們點了一個前菜、一個三明治、一個燉飯的情況下，第一個上桌的是三明治。按理說前菜的意思就是應該要第一個上桌吧？在上菜的過程中，服務員端盤子過來看見擺滿碗盤的桌面會等待我們挪出空位後才放下，我的意思是，他們並沒有自己整理桌面調整桌面的意思，他們literally在等我們挪空位給他擺，不知為何有一種熱炒店的既視感，感覺還是蠻新鮮的，沒碰過這種情況。
最後是領班的態度，用完餐後向一位不穿花衣服的領班詢問有什麼果汁，我承認是我嘴快在他要給我菜單前先請他告訴我有什麼果汁，其實對話就是很順暢的進行並且結束了，但就是有一種很冷漠很高冷的感受。
但我這個人真的沒有特別追求服務，我唯一追求服務的時刻就是我叫酒的時候五分鐘內(我說單杯紅白酒)要上桌，我別無所求。
噢說到酒，我一入座，他們送上菜單，我馬上點一杯調酒。直至此刻才告訴我調酒兩點後才供應。坦白說menu送上桌那一秒你有什麼食材有缺、哪部分的菜單這時間不供應，不都是隨口一句隨便一間早午雌店都會做嗎。
算是一個很特別的體驗","It must be said that the shops that can be opened in Dongfang Wenhua must have a little bit more powerful.
As soon as the front vegetable fried chicken wings can be known as the seasoning of the frozen chicken wings outside, the special marinade is accompanied by spicy Mei Niji, which performs very well.
The pork chop of pork chop sandwich is very thick and juicy. Di Rong's mustard makes the fried taste more refreshing. I did not expect that it would be like this taste and experience.The disadvantage of the beauty is that the tendons in the pork chop are not picky or the direction of cutting meat will occasionally bite the situation and reduce points.
There are a lot of mushrooms in truffle stewed rice, and the truffles are rich in flavor. The chicken wings cut on the rice are a bit funny but no harmless.
Next, the service and atmosphere, we are positioned at eleven o'clock, and at 11 o'clock to the scene.After the seat, there was only another group of guests. We had no other guests at the scene at the scene. We ordered a former dish, a sandwich, and a stew.It stands to reason that the former dish means should be the first to be served, right?In the process of serving, the waiter's plate came over to see the desktop full of dishes, and it would wait for us to move out of the empty position before letting go. I mean that they did not organize the desktop to adjust the desktop. Putting him in the empty position, I do n’t know why there is a sense of vision of a hot speculation shop. It still feels pretty fresh and has not touched this situation.
Finally, the attitude of the foreman. After the meal, I asked a foreman who did not wear flowers and clothes. I admitted that I was about to ask me what juice was before he was about to give me a menu. In fact, the conversation was smooth. It is done and ended, but there is a very indifferent and cold feeling.
But I really did not particularly pursue service. The only moment I pursued the service was that I would be served within five minutes when I called wine (I said a single cup of red and white wine), and I had nothing to do.
Oh, when I get a seat, I will give the menu, and I will order a drink immediately.It was not until this moment I told me that it was supplied after two o'clock.Frankly speaking, the second in the second time MENU has the lack of ingredients, which part of the menu is not available at this time, isn't it all casually, will you make it casually?

海鮮天使細髮不是我吃過最好吃的。加上一些新鮮帕西里和檸檬皮和汁液，同時放大一下海鮮切片大小，可能會更好一點。

可惜","Marseille Soup makes me feel experience, especially he is at the level.

📌懶人包請看這：
餐點除了薯條其他份量都偏少，每一道口味都中上，服務不太用心，缺少五星級飯店的專業，但甜點很優秀，必點！！

| 環境 |
座落在東方文華中庭的一家餐廳，座位多且寬廣，有室內以及室外區，環境優美，氣氛優很適合拍照

| 餐點 |
#北海道干貝海膽燉飯 $480
裡面有加芥末，醬汁濃郁，整體幾乎都是芥末味較沒什麼海膽味（微微奶香），但不會感到嗆辣，燉飯偏熟吃不太到米心，干貝有微微炙燒過很好吃，燉飯本身表現普通，但干貝好吃，不雷也沒特別優秀的一道

#炸牛排三明治 $530
不錯吃，裡面的牛排沒什麼筋很好咬，但裡面的醬料口味偏鹹，有點重口味

#lugano細薯 $200
份量多且價格划算，單吃或搭配旁邊三種sauce都不錯

#經典油封鴨腿 $680
鴨腿外皮酥內肉軟，烹調的剛剛好很好吃，但份量小有點偏貴，旁邊搭配的醃漬花椰菜第一次吃有點嚇到...極酸

#柚子塔 $320
每日甜點都不太一樣，可以先詢問店員今天是什麼，當天吃到的柚子塔非常驚艷！！層次豐富，從入口到吞下去夾雜著好幾種風味，連上面的裝飾每一片都是不同口感，非常精緻且優秀，這絕對是我會回訪此店的理由之一❤️

| 服務 |
當天只有一位服務生態度友善，其他都偏冰冷且不專業，甜點菜單上寫280，實際結帳變成320，詢問才告知因為點的是限量的甜點價位不同，收拾餐盤的時候薯條掉落也看著不撿，有點意外這個服務😳
另外很重要的是要水費，服務生點餐只詢問要喝水還是氣泡水，而不是“點水”，白白花了120喝水...

The meals except for the other amount of fries, each taste is too small, each taste is high, the service is not attentive, and the specialty of a five -star hotel is missing, but the dessert is excellent, it must be ordered!Intersection

| Environment |
A restaurant located in the Oriental Mandarin Atrium. There are many seats and wide seats. There are indoor and outdoor areas. The environment is beautiful and the atmosphere is very suitable for taking pictures.

| Meals |
#Hokkaido dried scallion sea urchin stewed rice $ 480
There are mustard minced inside, and the sauce is rich. The overall flavor is almost no sea lime flavor (slightly milk flavor), but it will not feel spicy. It's delicious, the stew itself is ordinary, but the scallops are delicious, and there is no particularly excellent lane

#Steak sandwich $ 530
Good eat, the steak inside has no tendons to bite, but the sauce inside is salty and a bit heavy.

#Lugano fine potato $ 200
The portion is large and the price is cost -effective.

#Classic oil seal duck legs $ 680
The duck legs are crispy and the inner meat is soft, and the cooking is just delicious, but the portion is a bit expensive. The pickled cauliflower next to it is a bit scared ... Extremely sour

#Grapefruit tower $ 320
The daily desserts are not the same. You can ask the clerk today. The grapefruit tower he ate that day is very amazing!IntersectionThe level is rich, and there are several flavors from entrance to swallowing. Even the decorations above are different tastes, very delicate and excellent. This is definitely one of the reasons for me to visit this store. ❤️

| Service |
On the day, there was only one serving and friendly service, and the others were cold and unprofessional. The dessert menu was written 280, and the actual checkout became 320. I asked because the limited dessert price was different. I don't look at the drop, it's a bit unexpected this service 😳
The other important thing is to cost water. The waiter ordered only to drink water or bubble water, not ""ordering water"", and spend 120 to drink water ...

炸牛排三明治牛肉軟嫩，調味剛好！外面的麵包是布里歐，鬆軟香氣十足！真的好吃的沒話說！,"Fried steak sandwich beef is soft and tender, seasoning is just right!The bread outside is Berio, full of soft aroma!It's really delicious!",False
地點完美就不用說，交通方便，飯前一杯調酒開胃，從第一道菜開始我就想加點，還好忍住，到最後還是吃很飽，意猶未盡；菜單是訂製的，非標準，松露也是自備的，酒是餐廳配的，一切美好；相片因為打燈的關係有些偏藍，只有後幾張有開閃光比較正常,"Needless to say, the location is convenient. The traffic is convenient.

燈光美氣氛佳，用餐環境舒適，位於台北最高級的飯店中庭，價格卻意外的親民，細脆薯必點，白醬松露手工麵醬濃麵Q，不論是調味還是口感以及上桌時的溫度都是五星級的水準，里肌豬排三明治的豬排有點過於厚切，肉比較不好咬，建議可以用略帶油花的部位會比較柔軟，芥末籽醬的味道有點太強烈，酸度稍微破壞了整個三明治的調味，但整體的口味依然優秀，總結來說這是一個想要私藏的好地方。,"The lights are beautiful and the dining environment is comfortable. It is located in the most advanced hotel atrium in Taipei. The price is unexpectedly affordable. The crispy potato must be ordered. They are all five -star level. The pork chop of the pork chop of the pork chop in the library is a bit too thick, and the meat is not easy to bite. It is recommended that the part with a slightly oily flower will be soft.

點了大家最推薦的細薯，剛炸出來酥酥脆脆口感真的不錯，搭配三種口味的醬-塔塔醬，煙燻辣椒美乃滋，薑味番茄醬，吃起來還是番茄醬最對味，哈哈哈！份量有點大，以二個女生來說真的吃不完，人數不多可能要考慮，北海道干貝燉飯雖然說裡面有加哇沙米但完全吃不出嗆辣感，還蠻好吃的，份量對女生來說剛剛好，干貝有炙燒過還蠻鮮嫩的，好吃！松露野菇細扁麵蕈菇味很重，但奶味不重味道吃起來不會很膩，綜合果汁就是奇異果+蘋果，中規中矩，整體來說用餐風味不錯，唯一可惜就是服務生跟大家評論的一樣滿不用心的，平日中午去吃，餐廳明明很空卻把客人全部集中在一區！？有反應因為疫情關係能不能換個位置，不要那麼擠（附近三桌包圍）明明很多空位，我們也只有二個人，結果服務生說全部有訂位不能換，結果吃到完明明那些位置都沒人來，感覺有點差....，用餐完畢因為朋友生病需要吃藥，跟她要杯白開水，結果她說只有熱水，還要我們請她幫忙加一二個冰塊變溫，因為要吃藥她才幫忙處理，這....實在不是一個飯店甚至餐廳服務生該有的應變能力！,"I ordered the finest potato that everyone recommended. The crispy crispy and crispy taste is really good.

For two girls, it is really incomplete. The number of people may be considered. Although Hokkaido dried scallop stew, it is said that it can be eaten at all. The amount of weight is just right for girls. The scallops have been burned and they are quite tender and delicious!Tulu wild mushrooms have a heavy flavor, but the milk taste is not heavy. It will not taste very greasy. The comprehensive fruit juice is kiwi+apple. It is as full of carelessness. I go to eat at noon on weekdays. The restaurant is clearly empty but concentrated all the guests in the first district!IntersectionThere is a response because the epidemic relationship can change the position, don't be so crowded (three tables nearby) obviously have a lot of vacancies.

Comprehensive handmade bread 250 yuan ~ There are 4 different breads in it, and it also offers oil vinegar sauce and cream. This is not bad

Coffee latte 220 yuan ~ The coffee base is a strong type, which is too bitter for me. Some of them asked the waiter for sugar

由於今天主要是想消滅ㄧ整份威靈頓牛排(需提前預定，現場還要等30分鐘）。所以3人只加點了一份沙拉。結果主廚又送了一份沙拉跟招牌細薯跟法式豬肉抹醬，加上附餐的時蔬跟馬鈴薯泥，讓我飽到天靈蓋。還把媲美侯布雄的馬鈴薯泥打包回家。用餐時不管是要茶水還是換餐盤只要把桌子原本立著的木頭骰子轉到需要服務品項的那一面，馬上有人出現，都不用舉手了。主角威靈頓牛排的邊角冷掉後更酥又是另一種風味。,"Since today I want to eliminate the entire Wellington steak (need to book in advance, wait 30 minutes on the spot).So only three of them added a salad.As a result, the chef gave a salad and signature fine potato and French pork sauce, plus the vegetable and potato puree with the meal, so that I was full to the heavenly lid.I also pack the potato puree comparable to Houbuxiong.Whether you want to have tea or change a meal, just turn the wooden dice that the table originally stands on the table to the side of the service item.The corner of the protagonist Wellington steak is more crispy and it is another flavor.",False

餐廳很好，但服務充其量只是平庸。我們從隔壁的麵包店買了蛋糕後要求提供餐具和盤子，服務生請我們自己去麵包店拿餐具。也許這不是咖啡館的責任，但對於文華東方這樣的水準的酒店來說，我們期望提供超越一般的服務。我們從咖啡館點了茶和飲料，這並不是說我們什麼也沒點。我們之前多次在盧加諾咖啡館吃過晚餐、午餐等。豪華酒店不應該目光短淺，因為在一次特定訪問期間沒有訂購大件商品而對顧客無禮。沒有人排隊，大約一個小時後，女服務員在我們要求之前就給我們帶來了支票，這是一種被動的方式讓我們迷路。我對文華東方酒店糟糕的服務感到非常失望。,"The restaurant is very good, but the service is only mediocre.After buying the cake from the bakery next door, we asked to provide tableware and plates.
