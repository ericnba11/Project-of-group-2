晚上來喝一杯，徐徐涼風吹來真的很不錯。推薦酒樂的烤物，有自己的烤肉架，專業也用心，所以雖然貴了點，還是覺得划算。餐點倒是一般，孩子覺得好吃就沒踩到雷。

今天就抱著要在戶外喝兩杯的心情選了這家店，信義區的熱鬧真的名不虛傳，越夜越美！
餐點都很好吃，頓飯得到孩子5⭐評價（自己也覺得很好吃）去看了場威秀電影，回來吃點宵夜也剛剛好。
服務速度是跟著客人數來看的，我覺得很不錯了，在國外，如果沒坐吧檯，也是要等些時間，小費更是驚人。建議坐在走廊的位置，有帥哥美女可看，怕冷的話就多考慮囉。
洗手間在室內，而且小，走趟室內，就會感覺室外與室內氣氛的差別哦！但是我還是喜歡室外啦啦啦啦啦

P.S.推薦給“不會看價錢+就想坐室外喝酒+要跟帥店長聊兩句”的你","2024/05
Come to drink a drink at night, it is really good to blow the cool breeze.Recommended barbecue of Jiu Le, has its own barbecue rack, is also careful, so although it is a bit expensive, it is still cost -effective.The meal is average, and the child feels delicious when he feels delicious.

Today, I chose this store with the mood of drinking two glasses outdoors.
The meals are delicious. I got the child 5 ⭐ Rating for meals (I also think it is delicious) to watch the show movie.
The service speed is followed by the number of guests. I think it is very good. In foreign countries, if you do n’t sit on the bar, you will have to wait some time, and the tip is even more amazing.It is recommended to sit in the corridor. There are handsome guys and beautiful women to see. If you are afraid of cold, consider more.
The toilet is indoors, and it is small. When you walk indoors, you will feel the difference between outdoor and indoor atmosphere!But I still like outdoor la la la la la la la
