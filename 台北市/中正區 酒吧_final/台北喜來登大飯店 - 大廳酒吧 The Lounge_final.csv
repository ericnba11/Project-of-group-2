海南雞飯和沙叼麵、牛肉麵都不錯吃，紅酒燴牛肉飯就普通，咖啡也不錯喝，但竟然有休息時間？！傻眼！傻眼！大傻眼！聽說是為了要騰位子給隔壁十二廚的客人使用？！若是這樣，一二廚的訂位不該超接，若一直是這樣，我吃十二廚就好，去大廳酒吧吃什麼？！頭一次碰到五星級酒店的大廳酒吧下午限時間的，這很瞎，不會再去消費！,"Hainan chicken rice, sand noodles, beef noodles are good, red wine stewed beef rice is ordinary, coffee is also good, but there is a rest time?IntersectionDumb!Dumb!Big dumbfounded!I heard that it is for the guests of the twelve chefs next door?IntersectionIf this is the case, the reservation of the first two kitchen should not be overwhelmed.

"一樓大廳的酒吧的半自助式餐點水準頗高，此次選擇的主餐口味皆在水準之上，唯一比較可惜的是，1:20分左右（取餐時間到2:00）自助吧的蛋糕甜點就沒有繼續補餐，多次反應皆沒有回應…
其實並不會因為區區幾塊蛋糕就全盤否定這次的用餐體驗，只是會覺得不解，不過我們對這次的用餐還是給予高評價😊","The semi -self -service meal at the lobby of the lobby on the first floor is quite high. The taste of the main meal you choose this time is all on the standard. The only unfortunate thing is that about 1: 20 (take meals at 2:00) buffet. The cake and desserts did not continue to replenish meals, and no response did not respond ...

台北喜來登大飯店 - 大廳酒吧 THE LOUNGE：假日中午，座位會分給自助餐12廚客戶所以若單純點飲料、漢堡、海南雞飯或牛肉麵，就會需要候位，但因為整體服務好，等個15分鐘也很值得，牛肉麵牛肉份量大又足，也很軟嫰不塞牙縫，十分推薦！,"Taipei Sheraton Hotel-Lounge The Lounge: At noon on holidays, the seat will be distributed to the buffet 12 kitchen customers, so if you simply order drinks, burgers, Hainan chicken rice or beef noodles, you will need to wait, but because the overall service is good, wait for someone, wait for someone It is also worth 15 minutes.

"環境很棒，座位區不擁擠很舒服，餐點也有一定的水準；但，提醒點總匯三明治的訪客，如果喜歡白吐司的總匯三明治要特別交代，否則現在的綜合三明治就是很像用軟式法國麵包做的總匯三明治斜切對半的感覺，我們點了實在不太習慣。

服務上，服務生一直很認真在整理座位，但對於客人的需求不是那麼主動到位的服務，例如，我們點一壺熱菊花茶，茶壺不大，倒兩杯就沒茶了，我們只能一直請服務生來加熱水，但因為服務生忙到像陀螺一樣，根本很多次，走過我們桌邊，還沒聽到我們在叫他們，最後只能大更聲叫住他們，這跟我去別的五星飯店的咖啡廳的服務不太一樣，通常是會注意客人，然後會主動過來詢問是否要加熱水，而不是要客人要一直盯著服務生來要求加熱水的服務。

我們因為是下午2:45左右入座，服務人員叮嚀我們，只能用餐到5:30，可能是晚餐時段要特別清場吧。                             2024-Jul-5","The environment is great, the seat area is not crowded and comfortable, and the meal also has a certain level; however, the visitor of the reminder of the summary sandwiches should be explained in a special explanation if you like the White toast. Otherwise The grinding sandwiches made by French bread for the half of the sanctuary is not used to it.

In terms of service, the waiter has always been very seriously sorting out the seats, but the demand for guests is not so actively in place. For example, we order a pot of hot chrysanthemum tea. The teapot is not large. Ask the waiter to heat the water, but because the waiter is so busy that he is like a gyroscope, he has many times at all. After walking through our desk, we have not heard us call them. In the end, we can only call them. The service of the five -star restaurant's cafes is not the same. Usually, they will pay attention to guests, and then they will take the initiative to ask if they want to heat the water, instead of the guests to keep staring at the waiter to ask for the service of heating water.

Because we are at about 2:45 pm, the service staff dodge us, we can only eat at 5:30, it may be a special clearing during dinner.2024-jul-5",False,0.066,0.041,0.893,0.7221

久違的造訪喜來登，來到了熟悉的大廳酒吧用餐，其他服務生也都服務的很好，會主動幫忙加水，有一個短髮齊耳的女服務生讓我印象深刻，即使戴著口罩也能感受到笑容，領檯帶位的服務生都很熱情，即使很久沒來，這樣的服務品質真的很棒。(^^),"The long -lost visit to Sheraton came to the familiar lobby bar for dining. The other waiters also served very well. They would take the initiative to help add water. A female waiter with short hair and ears impressed me.
