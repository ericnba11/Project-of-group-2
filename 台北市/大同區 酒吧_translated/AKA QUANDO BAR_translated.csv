"目前此餐廳只有提供兩種牛肉麵且無酒單；紅燒湯頭讓我聯想到滿漢全席，白湯部分則是比較像排骨湯，價格讓人驚訝。

調酒部分第一杯Gin fizz 氣泡感幾乎沒有，融水過度導致味道分離；第二杯Bee's knees喝起來蜂蜜與檸檬的味道沒有銜接的很好，主角Gin味道幾乎消失。

但店員服務態度很棒。","At present, there are only two kinds of beef noodles in this restaurant and no wine list; the braised soup heads reminds me of the full seat of Manhan, and the white soup part is more like pork rib soup. The price is surprising.

The first cup of the bartender part of the GIN FIZZ bubbles are almost absent, and the excessive melting water causes the taste to separate; the second cup of Bee's Knees has no connection with the taste of honey and lemon, and the protagonist GIN tastes almost disappear.

But the clerk's service attitude is great.",False
"酒吧和咖啡廳是在同個場地，也可以選擇吧檯的位置，晚上只提供調酒，沒有咖啡。

鹹食的部分只有兩款牛肉麵，上回吃過紅燒，這回選擇清燉。
清燉的白湯比較清淡些，但麵體一樣好吃，不過我個人比較喜歡紅燒，湯頭更有味道。

調酒的部分點了一杯“西西里的天空”，威士忌的味道比較嗆。
另外，還點了一杯「無酒精調酒」AKA Bubble，作為收尾。

調酒師很親切，耐心解說menu，剛好同時段有16人在戶外花園座位，頗熱鬧！

There are only two beef noodles in the salty food. I have eaten braised burn last time.
The stewed white soup is lighter, but the face body is as delicious, but I personally prefer braised, and the soup is more flavorful.

The bartending part ordered a cup of ""Sicily Sky"", and the taste of whiskey was more stunned.
In addition, I also ordered a cup of ""wineless"" Aka Bubble as the end.

第一次跟朋友來慶生就愛上這家迪化街附近的酒吧，剛好當天大稻埕煙火也能些微看見。店內裝潢很有質感且氣氛非常棒，調酒也非常好喝且不貴。壽星朋友相當滿意，大力推薦！,"For the first time, I fell in love with this bar near Dihua Street with my friends.

"這曾經是我在台北最喜歡的工藝雞尾酒吧。雞尾酒美味且原創，調酒師友好且才華橫溢。我和我的朋友每次回到台北都會在這裡至少喝一次酒（上次是一年多前）。

昨晚我終於回到了 AKA 酒吧，經歷了一次極其令人失望的經歷。長直髮的男調酒師似乎對我們想坐在吧台的位置感到惱火（儘管我們特意預訂了兩個吧台座位）。他懶得向我第一次來的朋友解釋他們的無菜單概念，所以我不得不向她講述整個故事，就像我在那裡工作一樣。由於雞尾酒是調酒師根據我們的口味在現場調製的，所以調酒師通常會在上桌時向我們介紹飲品。這位長髮調酒師一言不發地把飲料遞給我們，當我要求他簡單解釋一下飲料是什麼時，他再次表現出了他的惱怒。最糟糕的是，在他們關門前一個小時，他開始打哈欠並抱怨太晚了，讓我們感到不受歡迎。

如果這位調酒師製作的飲料非常棒，那麼他的惡劣態度也許還可以忍受，但說實話，它們很平庸。發生了什麼事，又名 Quando 酒吧？

跳過這個地方，試試 PUN 或 Bar Pine 的 Nest。","This was my favorite craft cocktail bar in Taipei.The cocktails are delicious and original, and the bartender is friendly and talented.Every time my friends and I return to Taipei, I will drink at least once here (last time it was more than a year ago).

Last night I finally returned to the AKA bar, experiencing an extremely disappointing experience.Long -hair male winemakers seem to be annoyed by the position of us wanting to sit on the bar (although we deliberately book two bar seats).He was too lazy to explain to my first friend to explain their menu concept, so I had to tell her the whole story, just like I was working there.Since cocktails are prepared on the spot according to our taste, the bartender usually introduces us drinks to us when serving.The long -haired winemaker gave us the drink without saying a word. When I asked him to explain what the drink was, he showed his anger again.The worst thing is that one hour before they closed the door, he began to yawn and complained too late, making us feel uncomfortable.

If the drink made by the bartender is great, then his bad attitude may be tolerated, but to be honest, they are mediocre.What happened, also known as Quando bar?
