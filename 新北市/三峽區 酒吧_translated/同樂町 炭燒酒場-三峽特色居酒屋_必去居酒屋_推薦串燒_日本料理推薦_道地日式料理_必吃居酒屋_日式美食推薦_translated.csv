"整體評分：3.8顆星

店內環境：3顆星🌟
店內冷氣非常不冷，只有後面吧台位置有冷氣。前面的位置因為門開開關關冷氣全跑光，加上晚上室外桌抽菸的人非常多，冷氣不冷，煙味又一直往裡飄，說實話，座的很不舒服。希望能改善這點。

餐點：4顆星🌟

👉🏻5星推薦：烤脆腸、烤魷魚、酥炸鮮蚵、烤魚下巴、炸牛蒡、烤麻吉。
以上6道無雷推薦！

👉🏻不推薦：
1. 酒蒸蛤蜊(很鹹)，如果能改善調味或重鹹者可試。
2. 炒烏龍麵：調味偏甜，非常不喜歡吃到甜味的炒烏龍，如果對甜味不敏感的可試。
3. 任何烤時蔬：都不推薦，因為量都非常少，少到你會後悔點。

【整體評價】因為菜量都很少，單價偏高，想吃飽不太可能，不太適合當晚餐。

Recommended by 5 stars: roasted crispy intestines, grilled squid, fried fresh fried fresh, grilled fish chin, fried beef grilly, grilled hemp.

整體感覺其實很好，不過流暢度一致或廚房真的卡單可以主動告知客人東西正在做或稍等之類感覺上會更好，不然也是傻等不知道東西是漏了還是正在做。","The two -three -five -six -six -six -six -six -. I really liked the poor impression for the first time.

"禮拜二有個特別活動是五串199元。可惜今天服務人員沒有介紹到這個，讓人不免有點小小的遺憾，也會覺得今天吃的CP值不夠高~

今天點了六樣東西。

1.醬燒雞腿 $60
雞腿蠻嫩的，醬燒味道不會太重，還吃的到雞肉本身的甜味，雞腿肉本身不會柴，還算蠻嫩的。 這道菜蠻好吃的！價錢小貴。
⭐⭐⭐⭐

2.鹽烤五花肉 $90
五花肉有把油脂逼出來，香氣也有出來，又還保有豬肉本身的多汁。算是烤的蠻不錯的！也是一道蠻滿意的料理。價錢小貴。
⭐⭐⭐⭐

以上兩種其實味道都蠻不錯的，之後來應該都會再點，可惜沒有搭上5串199元的優惠，不然滿意度會更高~

3.澎湖冰卷（季節限定） $280
今天來吃，最不令人驚艷的應該就屬這個了。味道普通，就是川燙過的中卷去冰鎮，然後沾醬油和Wasabi吃而已。 價位來說是小貴，但因為味道跟料理方式真的沒有什麼特別的，所以就會覺得沒那麼值得。反而我還比較喜歡下面生洋蔥的甜味。
⭐⭐⭐

4.讚歧炒烏龍 $110
份量中等，不算大盤，味道還算不錯，價格小貴但還可以接受，算是可能會再點的選項。
如果肚子餓，可以點來增加飽足感！
⭐⭐⭐⭐

5.香烤玉米筍 $90
這個是今天第二個相對比較沒那麼推薦的。
價格有點小貴，份量不多，但烤的其實還算不錯。今天的玉米筍品質相對較差一點，中間萎縮，玉米呈現啞鈴狀（中間窄，上下寬）。
雖說盤子上有附玫瑰鹽可以沾，用來凸顯玉米筍本身的清甜，但鹽巴的多寡不容易拿捏，反而是沾了冰卷的日本醬油，可以不會太鹹鹹，又更能引出玉米筍的甜味，還能讓玉米筍吃起來相當多汁。個人覺得對於普羅大眾，可能手法沒那麼厲害的話，沾醬油會是更安全的選擇。
⭐⭐⭐

6.烤飯糰 $100
烤飯糰算是我相當喜歡的一道料理。
價格中等，份量中等。
飯糰烤的外酥內嫩，而且感覺有用鰹魚醬油下去烤，讓吃飯糰的時候也能感受到香氣，算是烤的相當不錯！
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

之後可能還會再挑週二再訪。想吃吃其他串燒。今天唯一小遺憾就是不知道5串199元，菜色感想如上，其他都還不錯。
總平均⭐⭐⭐⭐

會再來！","There is a special activity on the twoths of Wednesday. It is 199 yuan.Unfortunately, the service staff did not introduce this today, it is a little regrettable, and I also feel that the CP value I eat today is not high enough ~

I ordered six things today.

1. Grawed chicken legs $ 60
The chicken legs are quite tender, the sauce will not be too heavy, and the sweetness of the chicken itself. The chicken legs itself will not be firewood, which is quite tender.This dish is delicious!The price is small.
Bleak

2. Salt grilled pork belly $ 90
The pork belly has pushed out the fat, the aroma also comes out, and the juice of the pork itself is kept.It's pretty good!It is also a very satisfactory dish.The price is small.
Bleak

The above two types are actually pretty good. After that, they should be ordered again. Unfortunately

3. Penghu ice roll (seasonal limited) $ 280
Come to eat today, the least stunning thing should be this.The taste is ordinary, that is, the medium roll of Sichuan to ice, and then eat soy sauce and WASABI.The price is small, but because the taste and the way of cooking are really not special, it will not be worth it.Instead, I also like the sweetness of the raw onion below.
Bleak

4. Loving 赞 4 $ 0 $ 110
The portion is medium, not a large market, the taste is pretty good, the price is small but acceptable, it is a option that may be ordered again.
If you are hungry, you can click to increase satiety!
Bleak

5. Fragrant roasted corn bamboo shoots $ 90
This is the second one is relatively not so recommended today.
The price is a bit expensive, and the portion is not much, but the baking is actually pretty good.Today's corn bamboo shoots are relatively poor, shrinking in the middle, and corn is dumbbell -shaped (narrow in the middle, width up and down).
Although there is a rose salt on the plate that can be stained, it is used to highlight the sweetness of the corn bamboo shoots itself, but the amount of salt is not easy to handle, but the Japanese soy sauce with ice rolls can not be too salty, and the corn can also lead to corn. The sweetness of bamboo shoots can also make corn bamboo shoots quite juicy.I personally think that for the general public, it may not be so powerful that soy sauce will be a safer choice.
Bleak

6. Baked rice ball $ 100
The grilled rice ball is a dish I like quite quite.
The price is medium and the portion is medium.
The rice ball grilled the inside and tenderness, and it feels that the catfish soy sauce is used to roast it, so that you can feel the aroma when the dinner ball is baked!
Bleak

After that, you may visit again on Tuesday.Want to eat other skewers.Today, the only little regret is that I do n’t know that the 5 string 199 yuan. The dishes are as good as above.

Miss Sister Recommended: 姐

Because this house izakaya is near the younger sister's house
So I have already visited the second visit and visited many times ~
For the three gorges, a good mountain, good water, and boring
If you have a chance to come here and don't know what to eat?
You can choose to try this izakaya!
Often when I am too lazy to come to the Three Gorges or friends to come to the Three Gorges to find me
Here is one of the places where I will bring friends to dinner
Food is good, the price is OK, and the atmosphere is also good!
I was very happy to date with my outstanding coach last night.

"門面不大、但入店後別有洞天，前方為四方桌、後方則有吧台位，一人用餐也方便.
第一次到訪、先亂點了一通～脆皮肥腸、烤香菇、明太子山藥、炒烏龍、蜆湯⋯串燒&烤物都有水準👍
唯獨裹粉的食材、外層的粉很厚，應該可以再調整的喔","The facade is not large, but there is no hole in the store after entering the store. There are tanks in front of the square table and behind. It is convenient to eat.
For the first time, I made a messy order ~ Crispy fat intestines, grilled shiitake mushrooms, Ming Prince Yam, fried oolong, skewers and skewers & roasted

"▼蔥燒牛肋$120（2串）：

牛肋條上灑滿蒜泥，一入口真的是濃濃的蒜味馬上衝擊整個嘴巴，辛辣的滋味就像嗆辣的口香糖一樣，瞬間讓人精神百倍，眼睛都亮了起來！

整體鹹味很足，最好配點茶水，牛肋有些咬勁，不是完全軟爛的口感。

▼鹽烤下巴$100：

鹽烤後的魚下巴，散發出微微的苦味，擠上幾滴檸檬汁能平衡焦苦並解膩。

油脂分佈豐盛，魚肉不算多，但吃魚下巴本來就是要享受「挑肉」的樂趣啊哈哈，不過不太適合我這個懶人就是了

▼香烤玉米筍$90：

香甜的玉米筍，沾上些許玫瑰鹽後，其中的甜味更是被全然帶出，清爽可口的滋味，可以稀釋一下串燒的重鹹。

▼烤麻糬$70（2串）：

糰子狀的烤麻糬，口感紮實，而且彈性十足，Q嫩的模樣既好吃又可愛。原以為會是薄薄的麻糬，沒想到像圓滾滾的糰子一樣，無論口感或者口味都很棒。

沾上滿滿的煉乳與花生粉，煉乳不是一般的死甜，感覺有混合一點奶粉，吃得出細脆的顆粒與甜甜的奶香，飯後甜點來份烤麻糬絕對是必須的滿足！

◎屬於中價位的同樂町，當天點的餐點幾乎不踩雷，居酒屋式的經營模式，店內環境很有日式風格。

很適合來這兒談天說地順便配個下酒菜，但如果想當正餐飽餐一頓的話，每人大概要抓個五百元的額度比較剛好唷！","▼ Onion roasted beef ribs $ 120 (2 string):

The ribs are sprinkled with garlic, and the mouth is really a thick garlic smell immediately impacted the entire mouth. The spicy taste is like a spicy gum. It instantly makes people feel full of energy and the eyes are bright!

The overall salty taste is very sufficient. It is best to match a bit of tea. The beef rib bites a bit, not a completely soft taste.

▼ salt roasting chin $ 100:

The chin after the salt is grilled, exuding a slight bitterness, squeezing a few drops of lemon juice can balance and be bitter.

The oil distribution is rich, and the fish is not much, but eating fish chin has to enjoy the fun of ""picking meat"" haha, but it is not suitable for me to be a lazy person.

▼ Fragrant roasted corn bamboo shoots $ 90:

After the sweet corn bamboo shoots are stained with a little rose salt, the sweetness in it is completely brought out. The refreshing and delicious taste can dilute the skewers and salty.

▼ Baked tweet $ 70 (2 string):

The grilled hemp -ramp, the taste is solid, and it is full of elasticity. The appearance of Q tender is delicious and cute.I thought it would be a thin hemp. I did not expect that like a rolling dumplings, it was great whether it felt or taste.

It is full of alcohol and peanut powder. The condensed milk is not ordinary sweetness. It feels mixed with a little milk powder. It can eat crispy particles and sweet milk fragrance. After the desserts of the meal, roasted hemp is definitely satisfied!

"那天餐點吃季節限定的澎湖冰卷、讚岐炒烏龍、醬燒烤飯糰、香烤玉米筍、醬燒雞腿串、鹽烤五花肉

醬燒雞腿串，味道不會太重，肉質也不會太老，蠻嫩的！但唯一缺點是，份量有點點少...

鹽烤五花肉，烤得蠻香的，肉質不會太老，味道拿捏的恰到好處，份量價格中等偏高

香烤玉米筍，整體蠻一般的，今天的玉米筍品質似乎好像沒有控管好？ 份量價格中等偏高
（他們提供玫瑰鹽容易不小心手滑變沾太多，後來自行沾醬油提味，意外也蠻搭的）

醬燒烤飯糰，我平時其實不太愛吃烤飯糰，但他們的烤飯糰表皮烤的酥酥脆脆的，不會太硬！意外的讓我願意吃下去，份量價格算中等

讚岐炒烏龍，味道拿捏不錯，份量價格算中等

Salt grilled pork belly, grilled pretty fragrant, the meat will not be too old, the taste is just right, and the price of the portion is high.

Fragrant roasted corn bamboo shoots are quite ordinary. The quality of corn bamboo shoots seems to have not controlled it?The price of the portion is medium and highly high
(They provide rose salt and it is easy to accidentally slip and change too much.

Sauce barbecue rice balls, I usually don't like to eat roasted rice balls, but their grilled rice balls are crispy and crispy, not too hard!I was willing to eat it unexpectedly, and the weight price was medium

Zanqi fried oolong, the taste is good, the weight price is medium

Seasonal limited-Penghu ice rolls, this dish is ...

"時隔快一年，憑著先前對您們食物的好印象，再次與朋友前來用餐，但沒想到這次讓我非常失望。

貴店上菜並不遵循先來後到，讓人感覺就是以人數大桌為優先，明明與朋友已到場且點餐完畢，卻只看到旁邊比較晚來的大桌上菜超快；後續經兩次提醒餐點未上齊，才通知我們大阪燒因為太忙沒辦法上(！？)(´⊙ω⊙`)因為大桌點太多，所以沒辦法上這道菜，看要不要取消…

當下其實挺傻眼的…
畢竟我朋友就是看上這道料理，我們才一起約出來吃飯，讓我對我的朋友深感抱歉，讓他大老遠跑過來一趟…

原本想說鬧劇也該就此結束…
但服務人員思維更讓我不敢恭維，我朋友回應取消餐點沒關係之後，他居然開始以隔桌也能聽見的音量跟我朋友說，「你看起來好像不開心欸拜託不要給差評啦」然後講了幾次之後，就說「不然這桌算我的啦」搞得好像我們是奧客，因為他就在那邊僵持說不要給差評，不知道的還以為我們好像在欺負店家 ＝＝

以這樣的看似低姿態方式，真的不會讓人覺得有被尊重，只覺得被情勒…被少上一道菜連一丁點情緒上的失落，都被拿出來這樣講得好像奧客在欺負你們，覺得感受超差勁…

希望貴店處理問題的方式是從根源做處理，而不是以這樣情勒的概念去圓好結果…然後也沒圓好：）畢竟我朋友不寫評論，但身為推薦餐廳的人，真的對他深感抱歉，就來留評論了…

因為沒辦法不給星，所以硬著頭皮按了一顆，不然超想給零… 然後我很少留評論，但貴店這樣的處理方式讓我傻眼到想留言了…希望您們好好改進，以上個人經歷抒發，各位斟酌參考：）","After almost a year, I came to dine again with my friends with my previous impression of your food, but I did not expect to make me very disappointed this time.

Guiden does not follow the food first and then arrives. It makes people feel that the large table is preferred. Obviously, with friends who are present and ordering, they only see that the big table next to the table is super fast. Remind that the meal is not available, and then notify us that Osaka is too busy (!?) (´⊙ω⊙`) Because there are too many big tables, there is no way to go on this dish, depending on whether to cancel ...

The moment is actually dumbfounded ...
After all, my friend just looked at this dish, and we just came out to eat together, so I was deeply sorry for my friend, and let him run around ...

Originally wanted to say that the farce should end ...
But the service staff's thinking made me dare not compliment. After my friend responded to canceling the meal, he actually started to tell my friends that he could hear the volume that he could hear at the table, ""You seem to be unhappy. After talking a few times, I said, ""Otherwise, this table is me,"" it seems that we are Olympic, because he is stalemate there and said that you should not give bad reviews. ==

In this seemingly low -attitude method, it really does not make people feel respected, but I feel that I am loved ... I have been emotionally lost by a little dish, and I have been taken out like this. Bullying you, feel that feelings are super bad ...

I hope that the method of dealing with your store to deal with the problem is to deal with the root causes, not the result of the concept of love ... and then not to be good :) After all, my friend does not write comments, but as a recommended restaurant, it is really Sorry for him, come and leave a comment ...

Because there is no way to give the star, I pressed one with a hard scalp, otherwise I would like to give zero ... Then I rarely leave a comment, but the processing method of Guidian made me dumbfounded. I hope you improve it. Express the above personal experience, please consider for reference :)",False
