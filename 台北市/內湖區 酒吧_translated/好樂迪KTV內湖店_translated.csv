男店員人超好 我們一群女生然後兩個男的在廁所都不方便進去叫人 他幫我們叫了他們 💗,"The male clerk is super good, our group of girls, and the two men are not convenient to go in the toilet and ask him to help us call them."
"滷味超好吃
包廂沒有什麼煙味
燈光配合著音樂非常有氛圍感
最後結束的時候
分別兩個服務人員來敲門詢問付款方式
其實不用特地來敲，很干擾唱歌
不能再唱的時候我們會出去結帳的","Beefi is super delicious
There is no smoke in the box
Lighting with music is very atmospheric
At the end of the end
Two service staff to knock on the door to inquire about payment methods
In fact, you don't need to knock on it, very interfere with singing
When we can't sing anymore, we will go out to checkout"
"這五顆星是給牛肉麵的
好樂迪就是要吃牛肉麵
其他真的都還好
菸味重廁所小
這裡的特大包廂是南部的超小包廂我傻眼...","These five stars are for beef noodles
Good Leddy is to eat beef noodles
Others are really okay
Smoke and heavy toilet
The big box here is the super small box in the south. I am dumbfounded ..."
"環境蠻乾淨的，廁所環境衛生也不錯。
音響設備很棒～
排骨飯很好吃～～～","The environment is quite clean, and the toilet environment is also good.
The audio equipment is great ~
Pork ribs are delicious ~~~"
食物飲料普普，算不上美味但費用也還好，覺得比較好的是炸物，有薯條、檸檬雞柳條和玉米布丁酥，如果有辦威力卡，周六晚上三小時一個人470，但同行友人說點歌設備似乎比較老舊，但我覺得經典的歌曲都有，所以還可以接受。,"Food and drinks are not delicious but the cost is also good. Those who feel better are fries, with fries, lemon chicken wicker and corn pudding crisp. But fellow friends say that the song equipment seems to be older, but I think there are classic songs, so I can still accept it."
"櫃台短髮戴眼鏡的小姐服務超親切
一進門心情就特別好😊😊
愉快的唱歌體驗","Miss who wears glasses at the counter is super kind
The mood is particularly good as soon as you enter the door 情
Happy singing experience"
好樂迪品質一直不錯，但廁所只有一間，所以會有人在那邊偷抽煙，這點你們需要加強管理。這次剛好也遇到臨檢。,"The quality of Hollydi has always been good, but there is only one toilet, so someone will steal smoke over there. You need to strengthen management.This time I happened to encounter a test."
"真的是很不ok的KTV
但離家近偶爾還是會和朋友同事來

真心希望可以改善一切的一切！
環境、品質、服務、食物等等⋯。","It's really OK KTV
But occasionally I will still come with friends and colleagues

I sincerely hope that everything can be improved!
Environment, quality, service, food, etc."
好久沒有回來唱歌了，包廂設備升級了，有點不太會用 🤣,"I haven't come back to sing for a long time, the box equipment has been upgraded, it is a bit uncomfortable 🤣"
"服務員不斷進入包廂打擾，導致唱歌體驗很差。時間一到就急著進入收拾東西也讓人不太舒服。
第一次遇到唱歌唱到一半近來收錢的，唱到喜歡的歌被打斷心情真的會很差，制度能改成進場前收費或結束後再付款更好。
另外建議等唱歌時間結束後，再詢問滿意度及需改進的部分，否則唱的得正開心還要突然停下來聽服務員講話，氣氛直接冷掉。
不過有芭樂歌很棒 :)","The waiter continued to enter the box to disturb, resulting in poor singing experience.It is not comfortable to enter cleaning as soon as time comes.
For the first time, I encountered half of the time to sing and sing. The singing mood will really be very poor when the singing song that I like to be liked. The system can be changed to charges before entering the market or paid after the end.
In addition, it is recommended that after the singing time is over, then ask the satisfaction and the part that needs to be improved.
But there is a Belo song very great :)"
"服務人員態度真的值得五星推薦
相較於Sing go,星聚點雖然氣氛沒這麼奢華
但也比較不會需要等包廂以及人擠人

評論可能都是跟現在的KTV,會所比較會略遜一點
個人覺得如果熟識的三五好友非常適合來好樂迪👍🏻","The attitude of service staff is really worthy of five -star recommendation
Compared with Sing Go, although the atmosphere of the star gathering point is not so luxurious
But it is better to wait for the box and crowded people

The comments may be more inferior to the current KTV, the club will be slightly inferior to
I personally think that if you know the three or five friends you know, it's very suitable to come to Loidi 👍🏻"
"晚上這一區就是美食沙漠
這兒的餐點CP值高
夜唱划算
之前早上來也很便宜
有ㄧ次來，巧遇會員日吧🤔️🤔️
2佰多唱四個小時
也太賺了👍👍👍👍","In the evening, this area is the food desert
The meal here is high in CP value
Night singing
It's cheap to come in the morning before
Come again, meet Member Day 🤔️🤔️
2 Bai Bai sing and sing and four hours
I also earned it too much 了"
"服務人員很用心。
空間較小，一間只有兩隻麥克風，無法增加。
包廂位於地下室，手機收訊會受影響。","The service staff is very careful.
The space is small, and only two microphones cannot increase.
The box is located in the basement, and the receipt of mobile phones will be affected."
"（2022.05.27消費）
這次消費體驗比預期的好許多，因原本看到眾多評論感到有些擔心。
不過這次的包廂無菸味、服務員雖忙碌但態度也都良好、廁所算是乾淨無異味、水餃好吃，整體感受良好，是會願意再訪的分店。","(2022.05.27 consumption)
This consumption experience is much better than expected, because I was worried about many comments.
However, this time the box has no smoke, the waiter is busy, but the attitude is also good. The toilet is clean and odorless, the dumplings are delicious, and the overall feelings are good. They are willing to visit again."
有些包廂距離廁所有點遠！歌更新的蠻快,Some boxes are far away from the toilet!The song update is pretty fast
跟朋友逛完美麗華來這邊唱歌，這間好樂迪還有歡樂吧，可惜中午的兩點就沒有了，三個人唱完五小時大概1200多還算便宜，只是我們只有低消的飲料,"Tarked with a friend to sing here to sing here. This Holy Di has joy. Unfortunately, two points at noon are gone. Three people sing about 5 hours and about 1,200."
服務生強調他們的包廂很溫馨建議大包廂，很好笑,"The waiter emphasized that their boxes are very warm and suggestions for large boxes, funny"
服務生態度很差，大的房間真的很小，餐點一般,"The service ecosystem is very poor, the large room is really small, the meal is average"
"位於捷運內湖站附近的好樂迪！騎機車來的話，店外有幾個機車停車格，若是開車前來的話，可能要停附近的citylink停車場！
包廂的大小還可以，冷氣也夠涼，5個人的包廂整體而言還蠻舒適，但包廂間的隔音沒有很好，有時會聽到隔壁包廂的聲音比我們包廂的聲音還要大聲（？）
服務員的態度都不錯，不論是剛開始帶位的人員、送餐的人員，甚至是入內請我們按滿意度調查的人都很好！（第一次看見入內和出來都會90度鞠躬的服務員！？）
雖然唱歌的中間有麥克風沒電的問題，但服務員也是很快的來幫我們處理好！","Located near the MRT Neihu Station!If you ride a motorcycle, there are several motorcycles outside the store. If you drive, you may stop the nearby Citylink parking lot!
The size of the box is okay, and the air -conditioning is cool enough. The box of the five people is quite comfortable as a whole, but the sound insulation between the box is not very good. Sometimes the sound of the box next door is louder than the sound of our box (?)
The waiter's attitude is good. Whether it is the person who has just started the position, the meal delivery person, or even the person who invited us to investigate the satisfaction!(The waiter who bowed 90 degrees in the first seeing and coming out for the first time!?)
Although there is a problem with microphone in the middle of the singing, the waiter will soon help us handle it!"
"2/28更新
今天又來消費
雖然體驗比上次好一點，可以加回一顆星
但是前台還是一樣對威力卡的優惠很不了解。
因為當下有壽星在場，可以領取壽星優惠折$300
進場前也有問前台，但前台說必須威力卡本人生日才可以使用⋯以為是2024改版，結果結完帳兩千六百多元，離開後再仔細看了一下使用注意事項，發現其實是可以使用⋯⋯又被誆了⋯

—————————
用威力卡消費，卻告知不是壽星沒有任何優惠
不懂當初一直推銷威力卡原因不就是因為有消費9折，來到了內湖店就沒有了⋯
希望使用威力卡消費的顧客可能要考慮一下了⋯","2/28 Update
Come again today
Although the experience is a little better than the last time, you can add a star
However, the front desk is still very unknown to the discount of the powerful card.
Because there are birthday stars present at present, you can receive a preferential discount of $ 300
I also asked the front desk before entering the field, but the front desk said that it must be used for the birthday of the power card. It is thought that it was 2024. As a result, it was more than 2,600 yuan. After leaving, I took a closer look at the precautions. Use ... I was stunned again ...

————————————
Consumption with a powerful card, but notify that there is no discount on Shouxing
I don’t understand that the reason for the promotion of the power card is not because there is a 10 % discount on consumption.
The customers who want to use the Trust Card consumption may consider it ..."
服務費收了300多，但服務生只有幫忙端個食物和收盤子而已……包廂清理很多都是我們自己處理的，掃把在垃圾上揮幾下說彩帶根本清不起來 光是清理我們就少唱了20多分鐘，我承認服務業很辛苦 但是垃圾也沒有必要叫我們清那麼多次吧？？？連續叫我們清了三次才放我們走……而且服務生口氣也不太佳😅前面還跟我們說清潔費還要收1000 真的不懂,"The service fee was collected more than 300, but the waiter only helped bring food and closing the plate ... Many of the box cleaning was handled by ourselves. After singing for more than 20 minutes, I admit that the service industry is very hard, but there is no need to call us so many times, right?IntersectionIntersectionI asked us to clear it three times before letting us go ... and the waiter is not very good. I also tell us that the cleaning fee is to collect 1000. I really don’t understand"
昨日把一個塑膠水壺杯確實放在包廂桌上忘了拿走，離開沒多久發現後有馬上打電話，也說了包廂號碼然後服務生卻每個都很快跟我回絕說沒看到，感覺就是騙人的，我說想要回去找，就一直說包廂已經接其他客人，是不是根本為了要趕緊接客快速清場面的時候覺得看起來是不值錢的東西所以當垃圾直接丟了，怕麻煩所以才隨便敷衍，連找都懶得找,"Yesterday, I really put a plastic kettle cup on the box table and forgot to take it away. After leaving, I immediately called and immediately called the box number and then the waiter. It is a lie. I said that if I want to go back, I always say that the box has been connected to other guests. Is it because I want to quickly pick up the guests and clearly clear the scene. That's why I was just perfunctory, I was too lazy to find it"
"服務水準低，態度差，很會趕客人 ～
時間到了是沒錯 不能等客人從包廂出來在進來整理嗎？有這麼趕嗎？很急喔？是有多急？  有差那幾分鐘的時間嗎？客人還沒從包廂出來，剛從廁所走回包廂 看到服務人員把包廂桌面東西掃空 真的很令人傻眼 客人還沒走東西全掃空 感覺真的很差，一點禮貌都沒有，沒禮貌也不尊重客人，還有問服務員問題愛理不理的，在不耐煩什麼？請問一下～還是說客人都不能問問題呢？這是服務員該有的態度嗎？一點都不尊重客人，真的很傻眼，趕客人第一，進場時間也會偷跑，花錢的還要看服務人員臉色喔？進場時間會偷跑是重點

服務也沒好到哪去！！！","The service level is low and the attitude is poor.
Is the time that is right, can't wait for the guests to come in from the box and come in and sort out?Is there such a hurry?Very anxious?How anxious is it?Is it time for a few minutes?The guests have n’t come out of the box yet. I just walked back to the box from the toilet to see that the service staff cleaned the box desktop. I do n’t respect the guests, and I ’m not impatient?Excuse me ~ or do you say that the guests can not ask questions?Is this the attitude of the waiter?I do n’t respect the guests at all, I am really dumbfounded. I caught up with the guests first. I will steal the time when I enter the scene. If you spend money, you have to look at the service staff?Stealing will be the focus when entering the venue

The service is not good!IntersectionIntersection"
環境還不錯，但12點才開有點晚了，如果能提早1小時開店會更理想。,"The environment is not bad, but it is a bit late to open at 12 o'clock."
"報到時櫃檯詢問是否有當月壽星，並推薦辦威力卡，但是結完帳才告知當天辦卡無法使用壽星優惠，那我也不知道幹嘛辦卡。

人多時會強制以包廂計費，訂位時未說明這點，導致花費會跟預期有差距，要注意。

菸味頗重，絕對有人正在抽菸。

炸物跟滷味都還不錯。","When I registered, the counter asked if there was a monthly star in the month and recommended a power card, but I told that the card was unable to use the Shouxing discount on the day after finishing the account. Then I did not know what to do.

For a long time, people will force the box to pay the box. This is not explained when reservation, resulting in a gap between the cost and expected. Pay attention.

The smell of smoke is very heavy, and someone is smoking.

Both the fried and feds are pretty good."
雖然是禁菸區域，但是還是可以聞到非常濃厚的煙味。連空氣中都飄著一堆煙霧。,"Although it is a non -smoking area, it can still smell a very strong smoke.There was even a pile of smoke in the air."
"地點不錯，但在地下室，我們2位用小房型，厠所在外。燈光效果蠻好的，但空調不太好調整。音效調整後還ok, 但是跟喇叭串音很頭痛，要移位置才行。發現現在的選歌系統都蠻難找歌，用注音選還蠻特別的。歌曲真不好找，最後乾脆就只能選點歌排行中的歌，這不適合全家連長輩一起歡唱，因為找不到歌，我覺得古老的我還是歌本比較友善，好找，螢幕選歌真的麻煩。服務人員很認真，我們這間服務人員非常有禮貌，點了一盤炸物，好吃，魚條熱吃，小雞腿不材，薯條也很滑潤冷了吃也還不錯。餐點普遍比星聚點貴，茶水一壼就破低消了，但鐘點費用比較便宜。","The location is good, but in the basement, we use small room types and toilets.The lighting effect is pretty good, but the air conditioner is not easy to adjust.After the sound is adjusted, it is also OK, but it is very headache with the horn skewers. You need to move the position.It is found that the current song selection system is quite difficult to find songs, and it is quite special to choose from.The song is really hard to find. In the end, you can only choose the song in the row. This is not suitable for the whole family to sing together. Because I ca n’t find the song, I think the old one is still friendly, easy to find, the screen Choosing songs is really troublesome.The service staff is very serious. Our service staff is very polite. We ordered a plate of fried objects, delicious, hot fish, and chicken legs are not expected, and the fries are very smooth and cold.The meal is generally more expensive than the stars, and the tea is low, but the clock is cheaper."
空間有點小但空調很ok不會悶，太久沒唱歌不太會用點歌機 XD,"The space is a bit small, but the air conditioner is very OK and will not be stuffy."

跟一般的好樂迪ㄧ樣，並無特別之處。,There is nothing special like the general Haolei.
"小包廂塞七個還是蠻擠，只有兩支麥
拼盤很讚","The seven small boxes are still quite crowded, only two wheat
The platter is great"
剛好在晚上9:30-11:45間帶孩子一起唱，食物供到11:00，炸物，炒青菜，白飯，味噌湯…………都很好吃，服務人員也很勤著來收拾碗盤，看孩子有需要也立刻幫忙，服務態度很好。,"It happened to be sang with children from 9: 30-11: 45 in the evening. The food was provided at 11:00, fried, fried vegetables, rice, miso soup ... Bowls, you can help immediately when you see your children, and the service attitude is very good."
"內湖店的包廂以KTV來說有點偏小，而且小包廂內沒有廁所，還要跑出去上有點麻煩，優點是沒有什麼煙味。
平日7點進去含低消大約400元。","The box of Neihu Store is a bit small in terms of KTV, and there is no toilet in the small box, and it is a bit troublesome to run out. The advantage is that there is no smoke.
In the 7 o'clock on weekdays, it contains about 400 yuan."
"因為位在地下室
整體菸味超重，散不去
包廂偏小
但是內湖也沒啥可以唱歌的地方
麥克風、喇叭還算可以
膨大海味道很怪
柳橙汁還算不錯喝","Because in the basement
The overall smoke is overweight and can’t be scattered
The box is small
But there is nothing to sing in Neihu
Microphone, speakers are okay
The flavor of the expansion is very weird
Orange juice is pretty good"
價格算平民，廁所走道很特別，因是假日去消費，包廂沒廁所就算了，去公廁還排了一下，有點不便～,"The price is considered a civilian, and the toilet aisle is very special. Because it is spending on holidays, there is no toilet in the box, and it is a bit inconvenient to go to the public toilet."
"這是我家族聚餐歡樂的好地方，
年輕老少都很愛呀！

5/18 煙味真的太重了，出來衣服超臭,"5/18 The smell of smoke is really heavy, the clothes are super smelly"
"住內湖來這邊唱歌很方便～不用跑到市區，而且平日人少少的臨時起意去唱都沒問題
服務人員的態度也都很不錯，很少遇到這麼有熱忱的KTV員工，滿加分的～
可惜就是煙味好重啊！一下樓就濃濃的煙味…","It's easy to sing here to sing here ~ No need to go to the urban area, and there are few people on weekdays to sing.

"自從疫情後就沒有自助吧
房間有菸味
去ktv抽菸的都去下地獄","There is no buffet since the epidemic
The room has a smoke flavor
Go to KTV to smoke and go to hell"
讚了有有提供樓梯給客人上下樓,Praise that there are stairs to provide stairs for guests upstairs
"食物很好吃～～
但唱歌的時候工作人員一直進來
收盤子2次 填寫滿意度調查1次 推銷會員卡一次
我們也才點1碗牛肉麵 1個拼盤 1壺彭大海
其實可以等唱完再收啊！
而且其中一次收盤子還差點要把沒吃完的拼盤收走 超問號
但最扯的是最後剩下五分鐘左右直接進來擦桌子？！？！！！邊擦邊說今天比較多客人在等
然後我們走出去結帳的時候沒看到半組人？？！
就算有人也不是提早進來擦桌子吧 有差這點時間嗎？ 感覺差很多欸

以上種種體驗是蠻差的～～","The food is delicious ~~
But the staff came in when singing
Fill in satisfaction 2 times and investigate 1 sales member card once every time
We also ordered 1 bowl of beef noodles 1 platter 1 pot Peng Dahai

Then when we went out to check out, I didn't see half of the group?IntersectionIntersection
Even if someone comes in early to wipe the table, is there a difference?I feel a lot worse

對於家庭學生消費上較能接受，交通上便利環境上也不錯。,"It is more acceptable to family students' consumption, and the convenience environment in transportation is also good."
唯一缺點是包廂菸味太重，去廁所還有人在偷抽菸。,"The only disadvantage is that the box has a heavy smell of smoke, and people who go to the toilet are stealing smoking."
雖然有主動跟我介紹辦什麼卡的200元有多送一小時跟送一壺飲料，但我還是沒考慮，哈哈,"Although I took the initiative to introduce to me what card I do to get a more hour more and give a pot of drinks, I still don’t think about it, haha"
服務生很親切，一個唱歌的好地方!,"The waiter is very kind, a good place to sing!"
服務態度還不錯 整體唱起來的感覺也還ok 但因為包廂比較小所以廁所是共用的 而且包廂也有些許煙味 有點小可惜,"The attitude attitude of the service is not bad. The feeling of singing is also OK, but because the box is relatively small, the toilet is shared and the box is a bit small. Unfortunately, it is a pity."

才結完帳，明明時間還沒到就直接關掉所有電源，真的問號…（？）第一次來體驗好差。,"After finishing the account, it turned out that all the power supply was turned off without the time, and the question mark was really ... (?) For the first time to experience the poor."

2月12日21點09分時有6個大1個小～進去消費，結果21:50分左右又多來2個進去很久了也都沒補杯子進來，大概23:15:46秒有先去結帳，結帳時我們跟櫃台說妳們餐點的內容送來都沒問客人ok嗎？就直接上~她回她們的套餐內容都是這樣～這樣如果去問消保官不知是否是強制推銷，我們去問櫃台回吃不完可以打包，我們先去結帳時問櫃台可以唱到什麼時間她回淩晨12:08分，我們家女兒還在包廂唱11:45分唱歌長唱到一半就被關掉，打去問說會在延3分所以等於到淩晨11分，因為歌一直被關掉23:50就被氣走了，請問你們收的服務費是這樣服務客人的嗎？那可真的很棒很厲害耶。,"At 21:09 on February 12th, there are 6 big and 1 small ~ enter the consumption.

Do n’t you ask the guests?Just go directly ~ Her back of their package content is like this ~ If you ask the insurance officer if you do n’t know if it ’s forced sales, let’ s ask the counter to eat it. We can ask what the counter can sing when the counter is at a checkout. At 12:08 in the morning, our daughter was still singing at 11:45 in the box to sing halfway until half of the singing. Turn off 23:50 and get angry. May I ask your service fee to serve guests like this?That's really great."
設施算新，但店員沒在管有人在廁所群聚抽菸，真的不守法。,"The facilities are new, but the clerk does not care about someone else to smoke in the toilet group."
今天來這邊消費，服務人員一直跑進來打擾亂氣氛，然後話都還沒講完就先跑出去了，都不用聽客人在講什麼嗎？,"Come here to spend today, the service staff has been running in to disturb the atmosphere, and then I ran out before the words were finished. Do you have to listen to what the guests are talking about?"
一進去包廂 滿屋子煙味 連出來以後 都還是渾身煙味，真的不推薦。,"As soon as I entered the box full of smoke, the smell of smoke was still full of smoke, and it was really not recommended."
"煙味真的臭  不喜勿進

服務人員熱心、環境清潔用心、戶外警車常駐安心，謝謝！,"The service staff is enthusiastic, the environment is clean, and the outdoor police car is resident. Thank you!"
服務品質可以選非常不ok，但會被經理或是店長逼問，一、設備偶爾會有當機、有些歌沒有。二、歌房煙味過重。三、餐點份量過少。四、店長或是經理態度甚差帶改善，選非常不ok會被質問且語氣咄咄逼人。五、價目表應該涵蓋低銷，3小時300元，含餐飲低銷則是410元，有種被詐騙的感覺。12月18號，15:30～18:30分消費於此,"The service quality can be selected very not OK, but it will be forced by the manager or the manager.Second, the smell of cigarettes in the song house is too heavy.Third, the meal is too small.Fourth, the store manager or manager's attitude is very poor, and the selection is very not OK to be questioned and aggressive.Fifth, the price list should cover low sales, 300 yuan for 3 hours, and low sales of dining and drinks are 410 yuan. There is a feeling of being fraud.On December 18, 15: 30 ～ 18:30, consumption here is here"
10/14 內湖店 卡友通霄119包廂 一進門伴唱機就有問題但是沒關係單純只是覺得進來查看伴唱機是否有問題的服務人員態度不佳請加強員工訓練 之後5點30分時竟然有服務人員詢問是否可以清理包廂我覺得很傻眼回應說通霄時間不是六點嗎？我也跟他再三確認服務人員也說沒錯之後5：55就直接收掉了我們貴重物品都放在包廂憑什麼服務人員可以隨意提早進入包廂萬一什麼損失又是誰要負責呢？請拜託加強員工素質好嗎不要讓客人感覺到壓力到底是有多趕著下班何況我們根本沒超過你們所說的卡友通霄六點的時間真的非常誇張我們只要唱歌都去好樂迪但是第一次來內湖店唉沒遇過這麼差勁的員工(伴唱機，收包廂是不同的員工)可見內湖店素質很低呢。本次歡唱體驗非常不愉快，也不會在來內湖店了。,"10/14 Neihu Store Card Friends Tongxiao In the 119th box, there is a problem with the entrance to the door, but it doesn't matter just feel that the service staff who have a problem with the reciproca machine is not good. The personnel asked if they could clean up the box. I felt very dumbfounded and responded that Tongxiao was not six o'clock?I also repeatedly confirmed to him that the service staff also said that after 5:55, we directly collected our valuable items in the box. Why can the service staff enter the box at will. What losses are in charge?Please strengthen the quality of employees. Do n’t let the guests feel how the pressure is rushing to work, let alone we did n’t surpass what you said at six o'clock. The second time I came to Neihu Store, I have never encountered such a bad employee (accompanied by a singer, and the charter is a different employee) can see that the quality of Neihu shop is very low.The singing experience is very unpleasant and will not come to Neihu Store."
跟其他好樂迪差不多，但在地下室會有個味道,"Similar to other good Leddy, but it will taste in the basement"
服務不錯，曲庫也豐富，但就是包廂內煙味重且隔音差，體驗不佳！,"The service is good and the curved library is rich, but the smoke in the box is heavy and the sound insulation is poor. The experience is not good!"
"今天過年期間去唱歌，在此感謝辛苦的服務人員，謝謝你們！
服務人員態度都很好，也很客氣，會來詢問客人的滿意度，很不錯💖💖 …","Singing during the Chinese New Year today, thank you for the hard work staff, thank you!
The attitude of the service staff is very good and very polite. They will come to ask the guest’s satisfaction, very good ..."
"很熱⋯沒看過怎麼熱的ktv
冷氣壞就應該要維修跟告知客人
不是我們進來消費才說中央空調無法動溫度
明明就壞還不承認！非常糟糕","Very hot, I haven't seen any hot KTV
If you are cold, you should repair and inform the guests
It ’s not that we come in to consume and say that the central air conditioner cannot move the temperature
Obviously it will not admit it!Very bad"
全家去唱了三小時，全身吸滿煙臭味的回家，真的超級臭的，廁所也很髒有濃濃尿臭味。環境衛生堪憂！服務人員多問兩句，睜大眼睛看著你。實在不推！不會再去！,"The family sang for three hours, and the whole body was full of smoke and smelling home. It was really stinky, and the toilet was dirty and thick.Environmental hygiene is worrying!The service staff asked two more words and looked at you with wide eyes.Don't push it!I won't go again!"
內湖最好的k歌場所，常有臨檢，相當安全，交通方便,"The best K song place in Neihu is often inspected, which is quite safe and convenient for transportation."
因為松隆店收了只好到此消費，包廂超小，非常擁擠真的不舒服，包廂也沒廁所要到外面上，沒有沙拉吧，食物不多，全部在地下室還擁擠，若有事故實在危險，非常不建議去遊玩的地點，能不去就不去,"Because the Songlong store had to consume here, the box was super small, very crowded and uncomfortable, the box did not have a toilet to go outside, there was no salad, there were not many foods, all of which were crowded in the basement. It is not recommended to go to the place where you can play, you can not go if you can"
"包廂選擇上，真的很不舒服。
7個人擠在一個小空間，還必須要向服務人員提出開成兩間包廂，完全失去了唱歌的興致。","The box choice is really uncomfortable.
Seven people are crowded in a small space, and they must also propose to the service staff to open into two boxes, which completely lost the interest of singing."
"沒有確實說包廂能容量的人數，提早訂位說可以給大包廂，但我們已經說有10人以上，但實際被安排的包廂只能有5個以內的，跟櫃台反應還跟我們說是大包廂，到底哪裡大？
自己員工塞進去唱唱看","The number of people who do not say the capacity of the box can be booked early, but we already say that there are more than 10 people, but the actual arranged box can only be less than 5. The box, where is the big?
His employees plug in and sing"
沒進包廂就要我們先決定好要要點什麼低消，問他不能進包廂在點嗎，還口氣很差的說現在先看，螢幕椅子摸起來也都有灰塵,"If we do n’t enter the box, we must first decide what the important thing is to be eliminated, ask him if he cannot enter the box, and say that you can look at it now, and the screen and chairs are dusty."
整個好樂迪都煙霧瀰漫有夠誇張！像失火一樣！距離包廂到的時間還有半個小時就瘋狂進來結帳收盤子整理包廂，員工素質超差，員工訓練絕對要加強！唱得非常不愉快，瘋狂趕人！看評分就知道這家好樂迪為何評論那麼低！超級掃興！爛到爆炸！失望透底！,"The whole good music is exaggerated enough to smoke!Like a fire!There is still half an hour from the box to the time of the box to come in and check out to collect the box. The employee quality is overworked. Employee training must be strengthened!Singing very unpleasant, catching people crazy!See the score and know why this good Le Di commented so low!Super sweeping!Bad to explosion!Disappointed!"
平日晚上歡唱挺好的，人不多，也不用等。服務生很有禮貌，也細心比較歡唱方案，雖然最後沒有採納主推活動，但也很客氣。位於地下室的包廂區整體不算大，可惜的是廁所在B1層右轉較深處的坡道，若在入口處包廂的使用者，走往廁所稍嫌遠一點。,"Singing well on weekdays is very good, not many people, no need to wait.The waiter is very polite and carefully compares the singing scheme. Although the main promotion activity is not adopted in the end, it is also very polite.The box area located in the basement is not large as a whole. Unfortunately, the toilet turns deeper on the right side of the B1 layer. If the user at the entrance is a little farther, the toilet is a little farther."
覺得這間好樂迪服務很好，離內科近，是下班紓解壓力的好地方,"I feel that this good LEDI service is very good, which is close to the internal medicine. It is a good place to relieve stress after get off work."
"負責門口櫃台的小姐感覺一副職業倦怠
在接待上表情就是不耐煩

7人包廂真的很小，有股煙味。

送餐點的服務生整體素質還不錯","The lady in charge of the door of the door feels a professional burnout
The expression on the reception is impatient

The 7 -man box is really small and has a smell of smoke.

The overall quality of the waiter at the meal delivery point is not bad"
"新歌更新的很慢
搜尋系統也只能找中文歌
最讓人不滿的是差10分鐘就11點
可以算下個時段的價格又外加一小時
但接待人員看起來是個剛來的妹妹
事後查才發現的感覺讓人覺得有待加強","The new song is updated very slowly
The search system can only find Chinese songs
The most dissatisfied is that the difference is 10 minutes at 11 o'clock
It can be counted as the price of the next time plus one hour.
But the reception staff looks like a newer sister
The feeling of finding only afterwards makes people feel that it needs to be strengthened"
麥克風很好唱，服務人員很親切。包廂很乾淨。推推推,"The microphone is very easy to sing, and the service staff is very kind.The box is very clean.Push"
有服務生刻意「順走」朋友的皮夾，調監視器都看到了還不承認，找警察來眼見騙不下去了還想私下解決，這樣叫顧客以後怎麼放心消費唱歌？,"Some waiters deliberately ""go away"" their friends' leather clips. The monitoring device saw that they did not admit it. They couldn't afford to see the police. They couldn't deceive them. They wanted to solve them privately."
價格高⋯品質差，包廂很臭⋯瀰漫著濃濃的陳年菸味。裝潢很舊，很多歌都點不到。,"The price is high, the quality is poor, and the box is stinky.The decoration is very old, and many songs cannot be ordered."
"因為疫情的關係
所以 自助式的沒了
這樣造成餐點有點少
選擇性較少
然後
歌單的部分
我覺得可以更多元了一點
或是 一些較流行的音樂
可以在更多","Because of the epidemic relationship
So the self -service type is gone
This causes a bit less
Less selective
Then
Part of the song list
I think it can be more divening
Or some more popular music
Can be more"
整體感受都還可以，但就是感覺歌比較舊，能點的比較少…,"The overall feel is okay, but it just feels that the song is older, and the less can be ordered ..."
雖然被評定為無菸地區但是相較其他ktv我覺得這裡的煙味重了很多但是整體品質還算不錯 價格也還有平價,"Although it is rated as a smoke -free area, I think the smell of smoke here is much heavier than other KTV, but the overall quality is pretty good and the price is still parity."
有位髮色較淺的女服務員態度很差，我們還再問話，她直接掉頭就走，請做好員工訓練。桌上放喉糖的小盤子灰塵很多，廁所的環境衛生也有待加強,"There is a female waiter with a lighter hair color. We also asked again. She turned around and left. Please do a good job of employee training.There are a lot of dust on the table on the table, and the environmental hygiene of the toilet needs to be strengthened."
我覺得還有很大的進步空間，煙味實在太濃了，即使是不抽菸，房間的味道也是嚇死人的重，點唱機的歌曲量感覺不太夠，很多歌曲都找不到......,"I think there is still a lot of room for improvement. The smell of smoke is too strong. Even if it does not smoke, the taste of the room is scared to death. The amount of songs of the singer feels not enough. Many songs cannot find it ... Elastic"
在地下室的關係，所以包廂空間不是很大，但是硬體設備還可以接受，跟台北很多間比起來偏中下，真的沒有場地才會選擇這裡嗨一下,"In the basement relationship, the box space is not very large, but the hardware equipment is still acceptable. Compared with many Taipei, there are really no venues to choose here. Hi."
颱風天先打了電話說現場候位，還特別問了現場目前沒人候位~結果到那邊，說唱一個半小時要收三個小時的錢，問我們能不能接受？請問為什麼電話不說清楚？這根本就是在騙~服務人員臉臭又態度差，要一個解釋就說“所以現在問你們能不能接受阿”~請問颱風天，本來就用假日收費，又剩下一半的時間可以唱，誰會接受？我其實想問的是，好樂迪現在都可以這樣嗎？明著搶錢沒有任何保障？真的很糟糕。,"Typhoon Tian first called and said on the scene. He also asked the scene at the scene. No one was waiting at the scene. As a result, when he came there, he had to collect three hours and half an hour of rap. Ask us if we can accept it?Why not make the phone clear?This is simply deceiving ~ The service staff has a bad face and a poor attitude. If you want to explain, ""So ask you if you can accept it"" ~ I would like to ask Typhoon Tian, ​​I used holidays, and the remaining half of the time can sing. Who can sing? Will it accept it?What I actually want to ask is, can Holydi be like this now?There is no guarantee for grabbing money?It's really bad."
"環境蠻乾淨的，服務人員也親切～
食物好吃～而且最近還更新了不少新歌～","The environment is quite clean, and the service staff is also kind ~
The food is delicious ~ and a lot of new songs have been updated recently ~"
超久沒唱了，有個女服務生，讓人感覺親切，服務很好，但疫情還是有影響消費的意願,"I haven't sang for a long time, there is a female waiter, which makes people feel kind and service is very good, but the epidemic still has the willingness to affect consumption."
服務生親切，餐點也蠻快的，缺點就是包廂太小了，10人的包廂超擠,"The waiter is kind, and the meal is quite fast. The disadvantage is that the box is too small. The 10 -person box is super crowded."
"假日以包廂計費
後來唱歌人數減少
想要轉小包廂
服務人員回答現在只剩大包廂
費用比特大包廂便宜790
只透露差價，不願意透露真實價格
後來和朋友討論還是轉去其他地方唱歌時
服務人員突然開門進來說有中包廂
態度勢利，感覺套好招數
整體感覺不佳","Holidays at the box
Later, the number of singers decreased
Want to transfer to a small box
The service staff answered now only a large box is left
The cost is cheaper than the big box 790
Only reveal the difference, unwilling to disclose the real price
Later, when I discussed with my friends, I transferred to other places to sing
The service staff suddenly opened the door and said that there was a mid -box
The attitude is snobbish, I feel that the trick is good
It feels bad overall"
"機台歌的數量偏少，三個人去給只二隻麥克風。
有低消","The number of machine songs is small, and three people go to two microphones.
Downside"
什麼年代了包廂內還沒廁所(還是8人包廂).這樣真的喝酒客會容易起衝突不是嗎?應該附近沒有別的KTV競爭比較吧~,"In what age, there is no toilet in the box (or 8 -person box). This will be easy to conflict if you really drink it? There should be no other KTV competition nearby ~"
歡樂吧東西很少，包廂很熱都沒冷氣……,"Happy, there are very few things, the box is very hot, there is no air -conditioning ..."
"不會再去了
也要唱歌的人也不要去
服務人員訂位時候說大包廂沒問題
到現場傻眼
什麼大包廂
只有6塊塌塌米大小
睜眼說瞎話
說什麼這是大包廂，哪裡大？
哪裡大!","I won't go again
Don't go if you want to sing too
When the service staff booked a place, it is no problem in the big box
Farewell to the scene
What big box
Only 6 pieces of collapsed rice
Open your eyes and talk nonsense
What is the big box and where is it big?
Where is big!"
"奶茶好喝😆
剛好遇到的包廂麥克風都很好唱","Milk tea is delicious 好
The box microphone that happened to be met is very easy to sing"
好樂迪的包廂音響設備 不知道為什麼就是不好唱耶~現在的版權問題 很多A咖歌手的連續劇搭配主題曲都沒有耶！失望,"Haoleudi's box audio equipment, I do n’t know why it is not easy to sing ~ Now the copyright issues are not available for the continuity of A coffee singer with the theme song!disappointment"
連假與週末價位不便宜，但本分店整體來說還算OK，沒有菸味強烈到難以忍受或是有生命安全的顧慮，唯一的缺點是包廂裡的牆面裝飾圖案很可怕,"The price of even holidays and weekends is not cheap, but this branch is OK as a whole. There is no smoking taste that is strong enough to bear or have life safety. The only disadvantage is that the wall decoration pattern in the box is terrible."
包廂內無訊號，不確定是不是每間都這樣，希望可以改善。,"There is no signal in the box, not sure if it is like this, I hope it can be improved."
設備還行，服務態度也不錯，缺點為裡面包廂（地下）可能會手機沒網路,"The equipment is okay, the service attitude is also good, the disadvantage is that the box (underground) inside (underground) may not have the Internet"
"酸民們別挑了! 在罵下去! 內湖沒歌唱了!
裡面的工作人員真的很辛苦！謝謝你們照顧這麼多喝醉的內湖人!
還好有你們默默的守護我們的失態! 大!感!謝!","Don't pick it up! It's scolding! Neihu hasn't sang!
The staff in it really worked!Thank you for taking care of so many drunk Neihu people!
Fortunately, you have to silently guard our disappointment! Big! I feel! Thank you! Thank you!"
服務態度很好哦，優惠主動告知，也會協助處理客人的疑問疑慮，除了有一點點老舊菸味 在內湖有一間好樂迪真的棒！！！,"The service attitude is very good. The discount takes the initiative to inform and help the doubts of the guests. In addition to a little old smoke, there is a good music in Neihu!IntersectionIntersection"
"女襄理服務態度超好 而且專業 但是其他人感覺 都很一般的服務  還忘記客人需求。。。

水點了三次 最後跟襄理告知才立馬送來。。

環境還不錯但是。。壞的壞。。然後很多設備都需要更新！","Women's service attitude is very good and professional, but other people feel very general services and forget the needs of guests.EssenceEssence

After three times the water, I told Xiangli three times and told Xiangli immediately.Essence

The environment is not bad, but.EssenceBad bad.EssenceThen many devices need to be updated!"
"11/21現場定位，11/22去的時候才被告知沒有歡樂吧而且還要低銷110/人，消費時間也有說錯(少說一個小時)。
其實這些在11/21都可以提前告知，當天才告知真的讓人很無言。

以前都沒有這樣，雖然能理解平日白天人比較少所以取消歡樂吧，但希望在訂位時能提醒一下。","11/21 On -site positioning, when I went to 11/22, I was informed that there was no joy and it had to sell 110/person. The consumption time was wrong (less hour).
In fact, these can be informed in advance on 11/21, and only the day is really speechless.

There was no such thing before. Although I can understand that there are fewer people during the day, so I cancel the joy, but I hope to remind you when you order."
本來想說內湖店客群的素質會比較好~結果一整間濃烈刺鼻的煙味，一群小朋友之間在廁所前抽煙，菸蒂直接就往地毯上丟，非常糟糕！😅 …,"I originally wanted to say that the quality of the customer group of the Neihu store will be better ~ As a result, a strong and pungent smoke smell of smoke. A group of children smoke in front of the toilet, and the cigarette butt will be thrown directly on the carpet. It is very bad!😅 😅 ..."
自助吧很豐富好吃，服務ok,"The buffet is rich and delicious, serving is OK"
開店已久硬體稍嫌不足，但每次來幾乎不用等太久就有包廂，算是稍稍加分,"It has been a long time to open the store and the hardware is slightly insufficient, but every time I come, I have a box hard for too long."
"真的很會拖  真的很故意
讓客人在前台一直等就算了
進來時間明明是17：30多一些    結果故意拖到快18：00在告知客人強制使用沙拉吧
有沒有需要這麼故意    真的爛透了","I really can drag it really deliberately
Let the guests wait on the front desk
The time to come in is obviously more than 17:30. Some results deliberately dragged to almost 18:00 and inform the guests for compulsory use of salads.
Is there any need to be so deliberate really rotten"
"打電話去問兩人唱歌的價錢
服務人員不知道在兇尛
我從頭到尾都客客氣氣的問
某兇八婆口氣越來越不耐煩加大聲
這種爛態度不要出來做服務業
希望妳趕快被炒掉👎🏻","Call to ask the price of the two to sing
The service staff does not know that in the fierce
I asked from beginning to end
A fierce eight -in -mys are getting more and more impatient and loud
Don't come out to do the service industry in this rotten attitude
I hope you will be fired quickly 快"
被朋友拉著來的，氣氛很棒，煙味很重，餐點份量少,"It was pulled by a friend, the atmosphere was great, the smell of smoke was very heavy, and the meal was small."
唱歌的好去處，辦了會員卡優惠多更多，還有很多折扣的劵耶,"Singing a good place, there are more discounts for membership cards, and there are many discounts."
人手明顯不足、裝潢連假、隔音差，一直聽到隔壁的歌聲，跟員工無關，好樂迪總公司該來看看經營環境,"The manpower is obviously insufficient, the decoration is false, and the sound insulation is poor. He has always heard the singing of the next door, which has nothing to do with the employee."
台北市僅存不多的好樂迪，包廂不大，設備一般，工作人員態度很好,"There are not many good Leddy in Taipei City, the box is not large, the equipment is average, and the staff attitude is very good."
"大廳接待人員超級貼心
因為這間好樂迪沒有套房式包廂
接待人員看見我大腹便便
還特地安排的黎洗手間最近的包廂給我們
而且我們顧著唱歌都沒有出去拿自助吧
他們還會來關心一下
真貼心","The lobby reception staff is super intimate
Because this Holydi has no suite -style box
The reception staff saw my belly to poop
The nearest box in Li's hand in the hand that was specially arranged for us
And we care about singing and not going out to get a buffet.
They will also care about it
Really considerate"
歌曲太舊，沒有伍佰的鋼鐵男子...硬體太爛，反應遲鈍。要耐心等待不然會當機。請服務生重開機浪費超久時間。可是服務人員親切美好。,"The song is too old, without Wu Bai's steel man ... the hardware is too bad, and the response is slow.Waiting patiently or not.The waiter is requested to re -start and waste for a long time.But the service staff is kind and beautiful."
可能是疫情關係，週四晚上，人不多，太久沒去，不會點歌了...XD....,"It may be an epidemic relationship. On Thursday night, there were not many people. I haven't gone for too long."
"以KTV來說 價格評價 以人頭計費
再加$150就可以自助吧吃到飽哦~~
但是有個缺點 菜色變化不夠多 久了會膩","In terms of KTV, the price evaluation is based on the head of the person
Add $ 150 and you can eat it when you are full ~~
But there is a disadvantage that the dish is not changed enough for a long time and will be tired."
"訂22:00結果22:51才走進包廂
不知道這麼好的效率是怎麼訓練出來的","Book 22:00 results 22:51 before entering the box
I don't know how to train such a good efficiency"
服務不錯，環境也蠻乾淨的，當然菸味還是蠻重的啦,"The service is good and the environment is quite clean. Of course, the smell of smoke is quite heavy."
服務態度非常不友善，菜單上的很多餐點也無法點。包廂沒有廁所，很糟糕的一次消費經驗,"The service attitude is very unfriendly, and many meals on the menu cannot be ordered.There is no toilet in the box, a bad consumption experience"
包廂內燈光單一沒什麼變化，要點餐時都找不到人，很多歌曲都沒有,"There is no change in the light in the box, you can’t find anyone when you order meals."
煙味很重，趕人趕很快，螢幕偏老舊。食物部分，尚可，不難吃。,The smell of smoke is very heavy.The food part is still acceptable. It is not difficult to eat.
"小包廂沒有廁所還是有點不便
其他都很好 服務也很好","There is no toilet in the small box, there is still a bit inconvenient
The others are very good and the service is also very good"
"煙味滿重的 包廂都滿小的
餐點也普通而已
但是價位相較其他好樂迪算偏高","The fumes with heavy smoke are full of small boxes
The meal is just ordinary
But the price is high compared to other good Ledi"
"環境乾淨，服務👍氣氛佳
餐點好吃","The environment is clean, the service atmosphere is good
Meal delicious"
前幾天去唱歌問一位員工廁所在哪裡，她好心帶我們去結果被另一個員工直接在大廳罵下班不打卡，罵的很慘，覺得很對不起那位姐姐，請問工作有必要這樣嗎？,A few days ago I went to sing and asked where one employee was in the toilet. She kindly took us to take us to scold by another employee directly in the lobby without checking in. She was very sorry for the sister. Is it necessary to work like this?
"還.... 不錯 只是服務員的臉色....有點不太好看
我們剛的 再點食物難免有一點超吵
服務員臉色就僵住了....","Also ... yes, it's just the waiter's face .... It's a bit not very good -looking
We just order food again, it is inevitable that there is a little noisy
The waiter's face froze ..."
"服務員一直進來很壞氣氛
但主要給3星是因為
看到天花板上黏著一大堆不明的衛生紙
覺得超噁 至少心情沒有被砸光","The waiter keeps coming in very bad atmosphere
But the main 3 stars are because
Seeing a lot of unknown toilet paper on the ceiling
I feel that super evil is at least not being smashed"
社區型態的環境，有間KTV蠻好，雖然無法和商業區的KTV相比，但作為熱炒之外的選擇，還能喝兩杯，唱歌，夠了。,"The community -type environment has a good KTV. Although it cannot be compared with the KTV in the business district, it can also drink two glasses and sing as a choice other than fried."
"貼禁煙卻有煙味扣一星
包廂過小扣一星
服務人員有提供椅子加一星
低消制扣一星
歌單過少扣一星
燈光設備差扣一星","There is a smell of smoke and a star with a ban on smoke
The box is too small, one star
The service staff provides a chair and a star
Low disappear deduction
Too little song list
Lighting equipment poorly deducts a star"
包廂太小，廁所只有男女各一間，服務人員服務還可以。,"The box is too small, and the toilet is only one of the men and women, and the service staff is okay."
讚,praise
2.30來唱三個小時 5.打烊也沒有先告知 只唱2個半小時卻收我們三個小時,"2.30 Singing three hours 5. I didn’t tell me first only 2 and a half hours, but I received us for three hours."
感覺服務佳！,Feel good service!
歡樂吧種類少，隔音有點差，一直聽到隔壁咚此咚此，服務員臉也滿臭的，如果不是因為近則不會想再去。價錢還行,"There are few types of joy, and the sound insulation is a bit bad. I have been heard next to this nap. The waiter's face is also stinky.Price is OK"
"自備酒開瓶費居然要1200元
這真的是太太太離譜了吧
真的不會再選擇好樂迪了","It costs 1200 yuan to open the bottle opening fee
This is really the wife's outrageous, right?
I really won't choose Holydi anymore"
男服務員態度不好，明明可以續包說不行，最後女服務員感覺職位比較高，專業度也比較夠，就可以續包了,"The male waiter's attitude is not good, you can obviously continue to say no. In the end, the female waiter feels that the position is relatively high, and the professionalism is enough, so you can renew"
空間狹小，包廂更小，廁所要共用還很小超小，旁邊的人噓噓時還會滴到你，是啥小,"The space is small, the box is smaller, and the toilet should be very small. The people next to the people will drop you when they boo."
餐點不多，大包廂點歌螢幕只有一個，沒有立麥，歌曲之間都是廣告。,"There are not many meals. There is only one screen on the big box. There is no Li Mai, and the songs are all advertisements."
还好，極少去唱KTV，也不太喜，也講不出什么缺点。牛肉麵和水餃貴了点但不錯吃。,"Fortunately, I rarely sing KTV, not very happy, and I can't tell any shortcomings.Beef noodles and dumplings are a bit expensive but good."
包廂在地下室，歡樂吧跟其它分店比起來稍顯不足，不過價格還算合理。,"The box is in the basement. The joy bar is slightly insufficient than other branches, but the price is reasonable."
"好樂迪的價格
地點在地下，旁邊有撞球間，可以續攤","Good Leddy's price
The location is underground, there is a ballroom next to the ball, you can continue the stall"
給51還認真工作的小姐姐點讚，餐點好吃，包廂沒什麼煙味是大驚喜！,"I like the lady who is also serious about 51, and the meals are delicious. There is no smoke taste in the box!"
設備新穎，歌曲更新很快，隔音效果不錯，附設的餐飲品質良好，閒暇可來此高歌一曲舒舒心,"The equipment is novel, the song is updated quickly, the sound insulation effect is good, the attached catering quality is good, and the free time can come here to sing a lot of comfort."
好久沒來內湖好樂迪了！覺得滷肉飯跟雞塊好好吃，住在內湖的朋友想唱歌可以記得來內湖好樂迪，唱歌聚會的好選項！,"I haven't come to Neihu Holudi for a long time!I feel that the braised pork rice and chicken nuggets are delicious. Friends living in Neihu who want to sing can remember to come to Neihu Hosudi, a good option for singing party!"
服務可以好便宜 週日才一人420 3hr 但煙味實在臭的很難受,"The service can be good and cheap Sunday only 420 3HR, but the smell of smoke is really stinky and uncomfortable"
雖然是新年較 貴，但家人相聚--太珍貴了，值得投資-親情-多照幾張，留住當下!可帶餐哦!,"Although it is more expensive in the New Year, the family meets-too precious, it is worth investing-family-family photos, retain the present! You can bring meals!"
