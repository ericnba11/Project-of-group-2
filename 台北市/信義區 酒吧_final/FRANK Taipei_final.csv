"帶爸媽北上體驗台北夜生活的重要元素 信義區、酒吧，融合以上兩點特地選看了可以看夜景並且也是自己存在口袋名單很久的酒吧。

我們大約8位，20:30時提前致電詢問8個人的位子，電話回覆說需要低消$15000，其餘的位子不需要這麼高低消的位子也只剩四人位（同時他們也回覆說這類位子的低消為一杯飲品），我們預算沒那麼高所以有點猶豫，但因為真的太喜歡所以決定還是到現場詢問看看。

21:00左右抵達我跟家人總共先四位先抵達，接著我就入內到櫃檯詢問是否有位子，狗眼看人低的女服務員（我管她是不是主管階級，總之這種沒禮貌的服務態度連服務生都不如）說如果沒有要特地包廂位子的話就不需要上萬的低消，而且現場都還有位子，所以人齊了就可以直接進去（這時態度很好），接著我就走到門口跟家人討論完之後（此時我妹又進去詢問是否還有樓上可以看夜景的位子，而且也確認了低消是否一樣一杯飲品，他們也回答說有位子，低消為一杯飲品）。

接著我馬上就帶著家人入內進到櫃檯，沒想到我們才一走進去，那女的竟然馬上跟我說沒位子了，我眼睛瞄了她的訂位本反問她剛剛不是還有位子怎麼這麼快就沒了（這短短幾分鐘的時間我們一直站在門口，也沒看到多龐大的團體人物入內），她可能心虛，故意把本子蓋住然後說呃對就是沒位子了，我秒懂她的意思於是就把家人帶出來了。

我家人當然也馬上理解，而且當下也感受到臭跩女的鄙視眼神。

那女的可能覺得我家人的穿著不像她一樣時尚，或者嚴格來說她應該是覺得穿著很俗很鄉下，然後可能會拉低她們酒吧的格調，但老實說，妳們沒有服儀規定吧？重點我家人也沒有說多邋遢，也沒有全身髒兮兮像流浪漢，請問是在跩3小？試問一下，妳家人如果被這樣用眼神鄙視，請問妳做何感想？妳們店有妳這種服務生，我覺得才是拉低格調的最大老鼠屎。

回到飯店後仔細看了一下google 評論，原來，只要給一顆星評價的，都是前台安管的臭跩態度，沒有說當服務業要多畢恭畢敬，但沒惹到你們也要態度這麼差？我家人每個薪水都肯定高你們好幾倍，對你們態度也很有禮貌，請問你們是在跩3小？","Take your parents to experience the important elements of Taipei Night Life in the Xinyi District and Bar of Taipei.

"儘管我與調酒師的遭遇不愉快，但為了其他客人和酒吧老闆的利益，我會公平地評價這個地方。

我非常喜歡這個地方。氣氛很棒。我在台北最喜歡去的地方。
尺寸並不純粹，這使得它變得親密、舒適和特別。

這是一家高檔酒吧，提供相對昂貴但優質的飲料，我喜歡這一點。
人群很酷，25歲以上，典型的富裕的見多識廣的人，衣著時尚，平和，舉止得體，比交往更私密。

外面的景色很美，裡面的氛圍很合我的口味，光線昏暗，不拘一格，有異議，組織得很好，有一個一流的酒吧，有多種酒/雞尾酒可供選擇。

音樂是雜貨店類型的，所有流行的類型/流派和熱門歌曲，令人愉快，但沒有個性/簽名。

出於尊重，我主動向業主提出兩個建議，因為我喜歡這個地方：

1.音樂選擇要更加精細、有針對性。

就像是，
主流和流行的流行週六，
週五爵士樂，
迪斯可舞廳週四，
週三放鬆一下，等等

2.門童、保鑣、收銀員、服務生、調酒師的態度。

噢，夥計，僱用那些懂得禮貌但不順從的人，
那些沒有脾氣暴躁外表的人，
聰明又冷靜的人，
在那裡服務的人們，
熱愛自己正在做的事情的人...

最終，他們並不重要或更好，他們和其他人一樣重要。

他們的存在只是因為您作為投資者投入了資金並承擔了風險來開設這家企業，更重要的是，因為我們，贊助人，欣賞您所創造的一切並經常光臨您的地方。

這就是他們在那裡的原因，也是他們擁有這份出色工作的原因。

所以，請把這種「我很重要」的態度留在家裡，打扮出最好的自己，不要變得順從，幫助人們享受他們的夜晚，用更多的辛苦賺來的錢來繼續幫助你保住工作。

聰明一點，如果你真誠、樂於助人，但又不走得太近，人們會感覺更好，從而花更多的錢。

2018 年 10 月 6 日","Although my experience with the bartender is unhappy, I will evaluate this place fairly for the interests of other guests and bar owners.
In addition, there is water under the bridge.

I like this place very much.The atmosphere is great.My favorite place in Taipei.
The size is not pure, which makes it intimate, comfortable and special.

This is a high -end bar, which provides relatively expensive but high -quality drinks. I like this.
The crowd is cool, over 25 years old, a typical rich and well -known person, fashionable, peaceful, decent, more private than communication.

The scenery outside is beautiful, and the atmosphere inside is very suitable for my taste. The light is dim, eclectic, objections, and organized well. There is a first -class bar, which has a variety of wines/cocktails to choose from.

Music is a grocery store type. All popular types/genres and popular songs are pleasant, but they have no personality/signature.

Out of respect, I took the initiative to make two suggestions to the owner because I like this place:

1. Music selection should be more fine and targeted.

It's like,
Mainstream and popular on Saturday,
Jazz on Friday,
Disco Ballroom Thursday,
Relax on Wednesday, wait

2. Attitude of Men's, Baozhang, Cashiers, Water, and Boamer.

Oh, guys, hire those who know how to be polite but not obedient,
Those who do not have a irritable appearance,
Smart and calm person,
People who serve there,
Those who love what they are doing ...

In the end, they are not important or better, they are as important as others.

Their existence is just because you have invested funds as investors and bear risks to open this company. More importantly, because we, sponsor, appreciate everything you create and come to you often.

That's why they are there, and they are the reason they have this excellent work.

Therefore, please stay at home with this ""I very important"" attitude, dress up the best self, do not become obedient, help people enjoy their night, use more hard money to continue helping you to save you Work.

Smart, if you are sincere and helpful, but do not go too close, people will feel better and spend more money.
