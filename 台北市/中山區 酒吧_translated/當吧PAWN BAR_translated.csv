烏醋也不錯，其他特別的酒調也非常棒
當舖x酒吧的概念非常新鮮
店員Alice的story telling技巧非常厲害～感謝你的耐性去聽我們的故事，為我們帶來特別的體驗🥹

The above is a thick layer of milk foam and biscuits.
Black vinegar is also good, and other special wine tunes are also great
The concept of pawnshop X bar is very fresh
The Story Telling skills of the clerk Alice are very powerful ~ Thank you for listening to our story, bringing us a special experience 🥹
Next time I come to Taiwan again, I will come again Pawn❤️"
"外觀就是一間當鋪，經過店員的介紹之下，了解這間店原本就是當鋪，而酒吧保留當鋪的裝潢，並沿用典當的特色，邀請客人用物品及故事來換取折價。

每杯酒都是典當的故事而特別調製而成，邊品嚐著調酒跟故事，不一樣的體驗。

店員十分的熱情會為你介紹酒的故事👍","The appearance is a pawnshop. Under the introduction of the clerk, it is understood that this shop was originally pawnshop, and the bar retains the decoration of the pawnshop, and follows the characteristics of the pawn to invite guests to use items and stories for discounts.

Each glass of wine is specially prepared by a pawn story. It is a different experience with bartender and stories.

The clerk's very enthusiastic will introduce you to the story of wine 👍"
很有趣的酒吧。本身是一間當舖，所以客人可以用自己的物品加故事去作抵狎，去換取一杯調酒。而店中的調酒都是別人的故事，店員送酒時都會詳細介紹調酒的成份及故事。調酒師很有心思，每一杯都另人有驚喜。基本上，我和朋友兩個人喝完menu上八成的調酒。,"Very interesting bar.It is a pawnshop in itself, so guests can use their own items and stories to make a cricket for a cup of bartending.The bartender in the store is the story of others. When the clerk sends alcohol, the ingredients and stories of bartending are introduced in detail.The bartender is very thoughtful, and every cup is surprised.Basically, the two of my friends and I drank 80 % of the bartender on Menu."
前當鋪改建，極具特色，原先走過門外，都不以為意這是一間酒吧，都是路過的年青人，問了一句「找酒吧？」 就是這進去… 真大鄉里出城… ；店內提供的調酒更是特別，都是調酒師精心炮製，都是有名堂😂,"Former pawnshop rebuilt, very distinctive. Originally, when I walked outside the door, I didn't think that this was a bar. They were all young people passing by. I asked, ""Find a wine bar?"" The bartender is special, all of which are carefully prepared by the bartender, all of which are famous."
"把當舖的故事融合很好的一間酒吧
很有特色，酒也調得很有自己的味道
可惜的是假日只限定兩小時，訂位時沒有事先告知","A well -fused bar of the pawnshop
Very distinctive, the wine is also adjusted with its own taste
Unfortunately, the holiday is limited to only two hours, and no inform in advance when reservation"
酒很好喝、我點了一杯烏魚子調酒，味道完全不違和，很有層次感。而且咪咪很帥，像崔宇植。,"The wine was delicious, I ordered a cup of mullet seeds to bartender.And Mimi is handsome, like Cui Yuzhi."
很特別的一間酒吧！名符其實的當鋪☺️☺️☺️ 還可以典當自己認為有故事的東西來換酒，這邊的每一杯酒都有自己的故事！很特別～唯一可惜的就是沒有餐點，所以來這邊的朋友們就是要吃飽飽才可以！第二次到訪時，我們典當了兩樣故事共換到六杯shot 😝😝😝,"A special bar!Famous pawnshop ☺️ 当️☺️ can also be paid to change the wine that you think of the story. Every glass of wine here has its own story!Very special ~ The only pity is that there is no meal, so friends who come here just have to eat!During the second visit, we paid two stories to a total of six cups of shot 😝😝😝"
很有趣的酒吧體驗，菜單很有趣，服務人員很棒，歌都超好聽！,"Very interesting bar experience, the menu is very interesting, the service staff is great, the song is super nice!"
"店面前身是當舖 保留下很多當舖元素
除了喝酒也可以拿東西典當換酒
酒單都是店家根據客人的典當物和故事做設計
蠻新鮮有趣～

因為本身沒有賣吃的食物
當天有和樓上造糕的人合作販售的2款蛋糕
還有就擺在店門口的窯烤pizza攤「Pizza boy」
點完之後會直接幫忙送進來～

附上當天點的酒們還有pizza
印象最深的是ZIPPO香水還會現場燒聖木 煙霧瀰漫❤️‍🔥","The predecessor of the store is the pawnshop to keep a lot of pawnshop elements
In addition to drinking, you can also use Dongxi Dianzhang to change wine
The wine list is designed according to the pawns and stories of the store
Quite fresh and interesting ~

Because I didn't sell food itself
On the same day, there were 2 cakes sold with people upstairs in cooperation with people upstairs
And the kiln baked Pizza stall ""Pizza Boy"" at the door of the store
After clicking, you will help it directly to send in ~

Attached to the wine on the day, there are pizza
The most impressed is that Zippo perfume will also burn the sacred wood smoke on the spot ❤️‍🔥"
"酒單和店內裝潢及氣氛都很有趣，一樓位子比較少，但也可以坐在二樓有不同的氣氛。可以點早糕的人的蛋糕，調酒配蛋糕是很不錯的組合。
酒的單價略高一點，但搭配著故事還是覺得很新奇。有機會的話在十點前來可以典當東西抵酒錢或換shots～","The wine list and interior decoration and atmosphere are very interesting. There are fewer seats on the first floor, but you can also sit on the second floor with different atmospheres.The cake of the person who can order the morning cake, the bartending and cake is a very good combination.
The unit price of wine is slightly higher, but it still feels novel with the story.If you have a chance, come at 10 o'clock and you can take things to get wine or change Shots ~"
"挺特別的一家當舖改的酒吧，❤️推薦，來試試，有趣，沙發也好坐🥰

我點白玉手鐲，一個悲傷，未婚夫婚前死了，白玉手鐲沒辦法當嫁妝的悲傷調酒🐣

如果你有故事，也可以來典當🐣","Quite a special pawnshop bargain bar, ❤️ Recommended, try it, interesting, the sofa is also easy to sit 🥰

I ordered the white jade bracelet, a sadness, the fiance died before marriage, the white jade bracelet could not be the sad bartender of the dowry 🐣

If you have a story, you can also come to the pawn"
"經過許多次，怎麼看都是一家普通當鋪，結果確是一家酒吧！朋友也是不小心發現，今天太早吃完阿財蔬菜羊肉爐就走過來續攤。

不用怕把門推開，進門櫃台大掌櫃就會詳細介紹店的歷史跟消費方式，非常和藹可親，不用怕，最特別的是還真的可以典當自己的東西換酒喝，但是得先跟掌櫃說能感動他的故事才能決定收不收當及價值幾杯shot。

同行的新加坡友人成功典當了一張過期的星展銀行提款卡價值4杯shot, 另一位日本友人則當了一個剛才喝的18天啤酒蓋，獲得2杯shot.🤣🤣🤣

很有意思的一家酒吧，晚只有20:00及22:30 二個時段，記得先訂位。","After many times, it looks like an ordinary pawnshop, and the result is indeed a bar!Friends also accidentally discovered that after eating too early, I came over to the stall.

Don't be afraid to push the door away, the main shopkeeper at the door of the door will introduce the history and consumption methods of the store in detail. It is very amiable. The story that moved him could decide not to be paid and value a few cups of SHOT.

Singapore friends who accompany the peers successfully paid a expired star exhibition bank withdrawal card worth 4 cups of SHOT, and another Japanese friend became a 18 -day beer cover that just drank, and obtained 2 cups of Shot.🤣🤣🤣

A very interesting bar, only 20:00 and 22:30 in the evening, remember to book a place first."
"酒吧外觀真的就像當舖！
假日去低消兩杯調酒🍹
一樓客滿可以坐在樓上造糕的人
（超多酷東西的店👽）
調酒屬於有特色每一杯都有故事
建議吃飽飯再來👌
開到半夜兩點半🥱聊到天荒地老","The appearance of the bar is really like a pawnshop!
Two cups of bartending on holidays 假
The first floor is full of people who can sit upstairs to build cakes
(A lot of cooler shops 东西)
Blooming is a story with a special feature
It is recommended to have a full meal again 饱
Open until 2:30 in the middle of the night, talk about the old land of the sky"
"以當舖為主題的特色酒吧，前身是真的當舖
酒單內的酒是以不同的典當品作為發想

限定時間內有可以以典當物品交換酒水的活動","The special bar on the theme of pawnshop, the predecessor is really a pawnshop
The wine in the wine list is based on different pawn products

In the limited time, there are activities that can exchange drinks with pawn items"
"承襲當舖的門面，撥放著80年代的歌曲
萬物皆可當，是他們的中心思想
完美的詮釋那句: 我有酒，你有故事嗎?
---
他們的Menu也很有趣
是一張張票據，典當的故事
每一杯調酒是他們用傳遞
當時那位典當者的心情
---
今天嘗試的是他們第二季的酒單
烏魚子禮盒
咸感的口感 如料理
如果不想只喝酸甜為主的調酒
這杯一定要試試

泡泡玩具
是一個漂亮的調酒
適合拍照 喝到鼻子上><

藍白脫
酒感不重 很清爽 果香帶氣泡感
是一杯很適合第一杯的酒

九份芋圓
與其說是調酒 不如說是甜品
適合後面幾杯 好喝

當吧的調酒師
喜歡聆聽你們的故事
也許這個故事
會成為未來酒單上的一杯酒

是一間很有趣的酒吧","Inheriting the facade of the pawnshop, the song of the 1980s is allocated
All things can be proper, it is their central thought
The perfect interpretation of that sentence: I have wine, do you have a story?
---
Their menu is also very interesting
It's a note, a pawn story
Each cup of bartender is for their passing
The mood of the pawn at that time
---
What I tried today is their second season's wine list
Mulleton gift box
The taste of salty feeling is like a dish
If you don't want to only drink sour and sweet bartending
You must try this cup

Bubble toy
It's a beautiful bartender
Suitable for taking pictures and drinking on the nose> <

Blue Baiqi
The wine feel is not heavy, very refreshing fruit aroma bubble feel
It's a glass of wine that is very suitable for the first glass

Nine -respectable taro circle
It's not so much bartending, it's better to be dessert
Suitable for the next few cups to taste delicious

Dangba's bartender
Like to listen to your story
Maybe this story
Will become a glass of wine on the future wine list

It's a very interesting bar"
每杯酒都有故事性，特色十足，有自己風味的一間店，氣氛很不錯，每一季都會換酒單，酷的！想換換風格可以光顧^_^,"Each glass of wine has a story, full of characteristics, and a shop with its own flavor. The atmosphere is very good. Every season will change the wine list, cool!If you want to change style, you can patronize^_^"
"故事的寓意與當鋪的歷史性。
店員的熱忱還有與當天大學學姐的巧遇😂
只有巧還是巧，朋友介紹的店。
每杯酒都有主人的故事，漸漸流傳下來。
老闆選擇留下原本的當舖想像也是一個很重感情的人，環境很舒適，假日的晚上是客滿的。
酒感我覺得即使是最濃的我覺得也都還好，喝個3-5杯肯定不是問題。
嘗試了心臟病藥-味道很特別，很見仁見智，我是會嘗試看看、香水、制服等等。
感覺是比較chill的酒吧，有低消，有官網😂建議先訂位。但喝到後面多次沒水服務生可能都在忙都沒有來補～","The meaning of the story and the historical nature of the pawnshop.
The enthusiasm of the clerk is also the coincidence with the sister of the university that day.
Only the shop introduced by friends.
Each glass of wine has the story of the owner, and it gradually spreads.
The boss chose to leave the original pawnshop imagination is also a very emotional person. The environment is very comfortable, and the holiday night is full.
I feel that even the strongest, I think it's okay. Drinking 3-5 cups is definitely not a problem.
I tried the heart disease-it was very special, and I was very kind. I would try to see, perfume, uniform, and so on.
It feels like a bar that is relatively Chill, there is a low consumption, and there are official websites.But after drinking many times, no water waiters may be busy and have not come to make up ~"
"走進當舖喝酒是一種特別的體驗，有創意的調酒，每杯酒都有自己的故事，
店員解說詳細，喝到快打烊還請我們喝bye bye shots把我們送走🤣","Walking into a pawnshop to drink is a special experience, creative bartending, each glass of wine has its own story,
The clerk explained in detail, and when you drink it, you also ask us to drink Bye Bye Shots to send us away."
點了太多杯已經不記得哪杯好喝(印象中茶酒不錯！)，酒單就是客人們的故事好特別，當鋪可以點當故事的概念也好喜歡！名片是打火機😆 …,"I ordered too many cups. I don’t remember which cup is delicious (the tea wine is good in the impression!), The wine list is the story of the guests, the concept of the pawnshop can be used as a story, and I like it!The business card is a lighter ..."
前身是當舖，變成特色酒吧。調酒都是有故事，上酒時會說故事，很有氣氛。無酒精也有2種選擇，也都是有其故事的，感受得到用心。,"The predecessor was a pawnshop, and it became a special bar.There are stories in bartending. When you drink alcohol, you will tell the story, which is very atmospheric.There are two options without alcohol, and they also have their stories, and feel attentive."
"超酷的店，很符合 speakeasy 精神。
原本的確是一間當舖，改裝成的酒吧後保留著門面，甚至還維持可以典當的服務。

酒本身很有特色，許多台灣或是古早味的元素；而且店裡竟然接受帶小朋友，讓爸媽晚餐後還可以喝一杯再回家育兒挺不錯。","The cool store is in line with the spirit of Speakeasy.
Originally, it was a pawnshop. The facade was retained after being converted into the bar, and even the service that could be paid.

The wine itself is very distinctive, many elements of Taiwan or ancient flavors; and the store even accepts children, so that parents can drink a drink after dinner and then go home to childcare."
"以當鋪做發想
典當回憶來換兌酒單
完全是一種「我有酒你有故事嗎？」的概念

店門口看上去真的就是當舖貌
要去的人要仔細看一下地址
不然可能會直接路過想說酒吧在哪😂

進門後稍微有一點酒吧感覺了
門上的對聯看了就是覺得該多喝幾杯
招呼的櫃檯上有著借條範例
如果真的有想要典當的物品
在這裡就可以先做兌換
店家會依你的「物品故事」精彩程度
來決定可以獲得多少價值的酒單
然後就可以在店內點酒做更換

不過這次去的算是蠻突然的
沒有打算做典當的動作
也是可以直接在店內消費喝酒啦～

經過第二道門就正式進入店內了
內部裝潢整個很復古風
入店直接有穿越的感覺
搭上近期很紅的「華燈初上」風潮
想感受一下70.80年代喝酒氣氛的
這裡真的超級適合

酒單不用多說
既然有這麼多客人典當故事
當然是依照故事相對特別的
來當作酒單的依據
根據典當物品以及故事去延想酒的風味
所以每杯都有它的獨特性及意義

與友人點了大概全部一輪
整體覺得酒感都不算太重
但每一杯在味道上
因為搭配著故事都有獨特的風味

如果喜歡一邊喝酒一邊感受時光
這家店真的非常合適

不過在食物部分
店內只提供小零嘴
就是很復古的餅乾
像是金牛角、飛機餅乾這類的
每包都是50元
可以點個幾包來解饞下酒

所以建議想來的朋友
可以吃飽飯後再來這裡
店內無提供熱食及熟食噢
另外店內的桌數也不算太多
去之前還是要先打個電話詢問訂位才不會撲空","Take care of the pawnshop
Memories of pawn to change the wine list
It is a concept of ""I have a story, do you have a story?""

The door of the store looks really like the appearance of the shop
Those who are going to go should take a closer look at the address
Otherwise, you may pass by and want to say where the bar is 😂

After entering the door, I felt a little bit of the bar.
The couplet on the door just saw a few more glasses to drink a few more cups
There is an exclusive example on the greeted counter
If you really want a pawn item
You can do it here first
The store will be exciting according to your ""item story""
Let's decide how much value of wine can be obtained
Then you can change the wine in the store for replacement

But this time it was quite sudden
No intended to do a pawn action
You can also consume and drink directly in the store ~

After passing the second door, I officially entered the store
The interior decoration is very retro style
There is a feeling of crossing the store directly
Come on the recently popular ""Chinese Lantern"" trend
Want to feel the atmosphere of drinking at the 1970.80s
Here is really suitable

Do not say more about wine list
Since there are so many guests a pawn story
Of course it is relatively special according to the story
Come as the basis for the wine list
Depending on the flavor of the wine according to the pawn items and the story
So each cup has its uniqueness and meaning

Order with friends, probably all rounds
I feel that the wine is not too heavy as a whole
But every cup is on the taste
Because it has a unique flavor with stories

If you like to feel the time while drinking
This shop is really suitable

But in the food part
Only a small snack in the store
It's a very retro biscuit
Like golden cow horn, aircraft biscuits
Each package is 50 yuan
You can order a few packs to solve the wine

So I suggest friends who want to come
You can come here after eating full meal
There is no hot food and cooked food in the store
In addition, the number of tables in the store is not too much
Before you go, you still have to make a phone call to ask the reservation so that you won't flutter"
"當吧
典當你的故事 典當你的回憶 折抵酒錢 甚至是變成常駐的酒品
這是在台北裡頭一個浪漫
在當鋪的外觀下 很容易錯過 另外需事先訂位
有區間時段
那天剛結束了勞資調解 覺得調解委員 還有資方都是一群白癡
見到朋友後 卻什麼也不想抱怨了
入座前 店家說：等等可以典當故事
我心想：工作上遇到的鬼故事也可以嗎？
但是典當的時間到了 我沒有去櫃檯訴說我的故事
我什麼也沒有說
看著朋友們詢問我早上的開會過程 我也簡單帶過
看著酒飲 以及眼前的朋友 整個店面的氛圍以及每杯酒的故事
我覺得：算了
我們是來尋找Friday night 的快樂
一切苦楚與怨氣 就算了 留到早上那討厭的當下
我沒有想要典當的糟糕故事
人生或許沒有很順遂 但是酒入喉卻很順
這樣就夠了吧","Be
The story of pawn your story, you can turn your memories and even turn the wine or even become a resident wine.
This is a romance in Taipei
It is easy to miss it in the appearance of the pawnshop.
Interval time
I just finished the labor and capital mediation that day, I felt that the mediation members and the management were all a group of idiots.
After seeing friends, I don't want to complain anymore
The shop before seating said: Wait can be a pawn story
I thought: Is the ghost story encountered at work?
But the time of pawn is here, I don’t go to the counter to tell my story
I didn't say anything
Watching my friends ask me about my morning meeting, I also brought it simply
Looking at the atmosphere of the whole store in front of the friends and the story of each glass of wine
I think: forget it
We are here to look for the joy of Friday Night
All suffering and resentment, even if the current now stays in the morning
I don't want a bad story that wants to be a pawn
Life may not be smooth, but the alcoholic throat is very smooth
That's enough"
"原先是一間老舊當舖，後來改裝成酒吧。
真的可以來這邊當東西，與其說是當東西，其實是當自己的故事，當吧把來當掉的故事做成酒單，讓來當掉的物品變的更有價值性了。
別出一番的質感，特別有意義的酒吧！

優點💎
1. 整間店讓人感覺非常舒適，也很有質感，舊式的感覺，連音樂都不放過，都是年代金曲，個人非常喜歡！
2. 在這裡能感受到店員們風趣幽默，帶三五好友一起來，完全不冷場！
3. 店家也超級NICE，從進來坐下到現在，喝了不知道第幾杯招待Shot😂
4. 調酒好喝～十分順口！
5. 還有做「無酒精」的飲品，照顧到開車的朋友🖤
6. 假日非常多人，建議要定位！
7. 六日店家和樓上造糕的人合作，風格也是復古電玩遊戲感，很特別！
8. 造糕的人可以打電動😀
很值得常來光顧的店！
謝謝店家，讓我來到一個充滿溫馨氛圍的地方🥰

缺點
沒缺點，抱歉。","Originally an old pawnshop, later converted into a bar.
You can really come here as things. Instead of being a thing, it is actually a story. When you should make the story that comes out, make it more valuable.
Don't have a sense of texture, a particularly meaningful bar!

Advantage 💎
1. The whole shop makes people feel very comfortable and very textured. The old -fashioned feeling, even music does not let go, it is the golden song of the age. I personally like it very much!
2. Here you can feel the fun and humor of the clerks. Take three or five friends together, not cold at all!
3. The store is also super nice. From coming in to sit down to now, I don’t know how many cups are entertaining shot😂
4. Blooming is delicious ~ Very smooth!
5. There are also drinks that are ""no alcohol"" to take care of friends who are driving.
6. There are many people in fakes, it is recommended to locate!
7. On the 6th, the store cooperates with the cake -making people upstairs. The style is also a sense of retro video game. It is very special!
8. Cake -making people can play electric 8
Very worth visiting shops!
Thank you for the store, let me come to a place full of warm atmosphere 🥰

shortcoming
No disadvantages, sorry."
"是家有故事的酒吧，適合著有故事的人，更適合會說故事的人。
帶著故事與物品，有機會兌換不等值的當票，可以抵酒錢，也可以保留將來贖回物品。
調酒都有自己的故事，是否充滿歡笑或發人省思因人而異，但都是各種人生百態。
座位不多，也有時間限制，記得要預約再來喔。","It is a bar with a story, suitable for people with stories, and more suitable for those who tell stories.
With stories and items, you can redeem the value of the equivalent, you can deduct the money, or you can retain the future redemption items.

There are not many seats, and there are time limit. Remember to make an appointment again."

"太愛吃呷滴，在某次呷滴打烊後發現當舖門口好像變得有點微妙和本來不太一樣⋯⋯
看呀看的突然有人走出來說了聲歡迎光臨還問號了一下，想說當鋪有在跟人家講歡迎光臨的嗎？
接著呷滴店員下樓問了他以後，他說對啊是新開的，以前是當舖沒錯。Wow！Amazing！立刻揪團喝起來～
當吧將典當這件事與飲酒做了完美的結合，在這裡你可以帶東西來典當，當票可以折抵當日酒錢，這項服務真的是新鮮到很有趣啊～典當過程中的對談也很鬧，快來這裡用典當物和大家分享人生故事吧😂😂😂
招牌調酒們的取名很台很有意思，喝起來也都很有味道，服務人員也會親切介紹調酒的種類，保證不會喝到自己不愛的雷酒👍🏻👍🏻
希望零食和下酒菜可以愈來愈多，因為喝多的時候會很想一直吃🤩
微醺著要趕搭最後一班捷運時服務人員還不小心講錯方向，抱歉打趣的說下次來找他欠我們六杯shot～好喔！這不二訪三訪N訪怎麼能夠！","I love to eat dripping too much. After a little bit of dripping, I found that the door of the pawn shop seemed to be a bit subtle and the same is different.
Suddenly someone came out and said, please come to the question mark. Do you want to say that the pawn shop is welcomed to others?
After the clerk went downstairs and asked him, he said that it was newly opened. It used to be a pawnshop.Wow!Amazing!Drink the group immediately ~
Dangba is perfectly combined with the matter with drinking alcohol. Here you can bring things to the pawn. When the ticket can be discounted to the day's wine, this service is really fresh and interesting. It's also very noisy, come here to share the life story with you in a pawn thing 😂😂😂
The names of the signature bartenders are very interesting, and they are also very delicious when they drink. The service staff will also introduce the types of bartending to ensure that they will not drink the thunder wine they don’t love.
I hope there can be more and more snacks and jams, because when you drink too much
Wei Wei was going to accidentally talk about the wrong direction when he was going to rush to the last MRT. Sorry to say that he would come to him to owe us six cups of SHOT next time ~ Okay!How can this visit to the three visits N visit!"

這裡真的就像當舖一樣，你可以把你自己有回憶或是不到的東西拿過來典當，典當的錢可以拿來折抵店內的消費，非常特別；裝潢也是很復古，音樂也很常播放一些復古的歌曲。
這季的酒單主要就是一些很有台灣本土風味的特調，像是用津津蘆筍汁的調酒、芋頭冰、甚至用台啤整瓶600ml的熱炒類調酒，不但有特色且也都很好喝。
店長跟bartender 也都非常熱情，讓人整個體驗是非常舒服的，建議去中山區跑吧的時候別忘了進去試試看這家特色酒吧。","A very distinctive bar, it is said to be re -decorated into a bar after being packed with a pawnshop with a old -fashioned name.

This season's wine list is mainly specialized in Taiwan's local flavors, such as bartending, taro ice with Jinjin asparagus juice, taro ice, and even a full bottle of 600ml of hot frying. Very delicious.

在12/25零晨到訪，剛好第一天上新酒單，喝完結帳時有詢問我們對新酒單的意見，讓我們感到店家對客戶十分重視。特別喜歡這次新酒單裏的Zippo 香水，糅合了秘魯聖木與鼠尾草兩種我喜歡的配方。推薦大家如果當天不順推喝這杯，可以淨化自己一下。,"Visit in the morning on 12/25, just on the first day of the new wine list. When I finished drinking, I asked our opinions on the new wine list, which made us feel that the store attaches great importance to customers.I especially like the Zippo perfume in the new wine list, which combines the two formulas I like two types of Peruvian St. Wood and sage.It is recommended that you can purify yourself if you do n’t push this cup that day."
很特別的一間店，菜單設計也很用心，每一個典當品代表一杯酒，酒吧內只有小零食沒有熱食，適合朋友聊天的地方，酒吧門口也很特別，就像來當舖一樣😂 …,"A very special store, the menu design is also very careful. Each pawn represents a glass of wine. There is only small snacks in the bar without hot food. It is suitable for friends to chat."
超酷的一家店，點的調酒店員都會親切仔細介紹👍口味也很特別，有別於一般調酒❤️ …,"The cool shop, the ordering staff who ordered the cordially introduced 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 超 超 超 超 超 ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤…… ..."

以茶為基酒，加上高粱的香，還有高山茶梅，好喝，記得，茶梅要嚼十下以上，才能品嚐處甘甜的口感！,"Taking tea as a base wine, with the fragrance of sorghum, as well as alpine tea plums, it is delicious. Remember, the tea plum must be chewed more than ten times to taste the sweet taste!"
有幸參加Kazuya的酒會，店內氣氛很棒，而且有著“典當”換酒或是可以贖回典當物的服務，每個典當物都有自己的故事；調酒技術不錯，Bartender風趣幽默，非常適合自己放鬆來這小酌一番，亦或是帶朋友來！,"Fortunately to participate in Kazuya's reception, the atmosphere in the store is great, and it has a ""pawn"" service that changes wine or can be redeemed.

"這杯「前公司的名片」承載著一段剛出社會新鮮人的故事，盼了許久終於長大成人工作，拿到夢寐以求代表自己的簡介的名片，那份悸動。酸酸甜甜的滋味猶如初戀那般令人難以忘懷。
整家店面以當舖為主題，裝潢、氣氛、音樂走一個復古老式的風格，讓人彷彿走入時空隧道，體驗了過往人們的一種生活方式。","This ""former company's business card"" carries a story of new people who just came out of society. After a long time, I have finally grown up an adult work.The sweet and sour taste is as unforgettable as the first love.

"酒吧前身是當鋪，因此在菜單設計上加入此巧思，非常有意思。
環境燈光令人放鬆，只是對坐的沙發有點距離，要跟同行者聊天需要費點力氣。","The bar is a pawn shop, so it is very interesting to add this ingenuity in the menu design.
The environmental lights are relaxed, but it is a bit far away for the sofa you sit. It takes some effort to chat with your colleagues."

"以前身當舖為出發點是一個很酷的點子，很早就想體驗看看典當商品的過程，如果你有好的故事，都可能可以獲得一些不錯的回報哈哈哈，但典當的過程才是重要的

酒都是以典當商品作為命名，上面也有介紹典當的過程與故事，與當時所獲得的典當結果，整體來說滿酷也滿新鮮的，調酒師應該都試了滿多次才能得到這些調酒

整體感受很棒，有機會會再來的！","The starting point of the predecessor shop is a very cool idea. I want to experience the process of seeking a pawn product very early. If you have a good story, you can get some good returns hahaha, but the process of pawn is important.

可以典當自己有故事的物品

假日低消兩杯調酒
沒有食物自己覺得喝得有點累","The shop is very distinctive, it is a bar transformed into a pawnshop
You can take the item that you have a story

I feel a little tired to drink without food"

Shot起來的好地方！","You can take your own story ...

"裝潢跟酒單的設計都別有風格

不過我們10人點了各項飲品，大家普遍認為有很大的改善空間；

我自己也試了兩種招牌調酒、一種經典調酒、一種無酒精，也覺得味道有些差強人意，可惜。","The design of the decoration and the wine list has different styles

However, 10 of us ordered various drinks, and everyone generally believes that there is a lot of room for improvement;

I also tried two signs of bartending, a classic bartending, and a kind of alcohol, and I also felt that the taste was a bit unsatisfactory, but unfortunately."
氛圍很讚，調酒也好喝,"The atmosphere is great, and the bartender is also delicious"
"杯口破掉完全沒關心客人，還說要收破杯費200？
完全不推薦大家來，要來的話記得小心飲用😊

真的氣到不行，只大概記得以下片段。
今天來到這間酒吧總共點了4杯調酒，其中在喝Mai Tai經典調酒時，喝到一半杯口竟然破掉，當下我還嘴巴馬上小心吐出兩片玻璃，友人協助告知服務生，女店長沒說什麼拿走破口玻璃杯後離開，之後我為了檢查口中是否還有碎片以及傷口去了廁所，接著服務生來詢問友人，開始以下對話：
服務生：請問還有需要加點嗎？
友人：沒有
服務生：那這樣的話我們要收破杯費200元
友人當下來不及反應，回答：嗯
友人反應過來之後找來服務生反應疑惑。
友人：今天破杯這種情形不是摔破或是惡意用破，是破在杯口的位子，感覺收破杯費不太合理
服務生：好，我去回應一下
之後我從廁所回到位置
工讀服務生來回應：因為這是我們店長說的，所以可能⋯
我們：還是可以找你們店長來討論嗎
服務生：好
過大概約五分鐘
店長：因為今天杯子是你們用破的，所以需要收破杯費200元，但沒關係，今天幫你們扣掉
我們：因為今天是破在杯口，也沒辦法保證上酒時杯子是不是完全完好，也有可能其實有裂縫
店長：因為之前也有客人發生這種問題，客人都會說自己咬的
我們：所以之前有發生過這種問題？
店長：嗯
我們：那每個人喝酒習慣不同，杯子可能當時也有問題
店長：你們沒有問題，那我們也確認過我們沒有問題
我們：你們這樣的處理方式蠻奇妙的
店長：（沒說話）
我們：沒關係 結帳 謝謝

然後收到帳單時（如圖），上面還是有破杯費，馬上詢問服務生這明細上面怎麼還是有破杯費用，服務生告知：我們幫你們扣掉了。
結帳應該提供最終明細吧？？？
之後去門口結帳（確實有扣掉200），結完帳要踏出門口之前，服務生說了一句：下次請小心喔！
我：什麼意思？
服務生：嗯 沒事
（請問是誰該小心？誰知道喝酒喝一喝會杯口破掉？去過很多酒吧都沒發生過這種問題）

原本喝酒喝的好好的，突然發生這種事情，加上這種處理態度真的是非常非常不滿意。

告知杯口破了之後，完全沒有關心客人是否受傷？接著說要收200元破杯費，請問有辦法確認杯子完全毫髮無損沒有裂痕？如果之前發生過類似情形（而且聽起來不止一次），為何不著手改善？要馬1.沒辦法更改杯子款式的話，上酒前請提醒客人杯口偏薄請注意飲用如果有破杯情形要酌收200元破杯費，客人就會先檢查杯子並且「非常小心」飲用，2.換杯子款式。

兩者都沒做到且處理流程及態度非常不好，完全不推薦大家來，免得自己受傷了還被要求賠200加上一肚子氣☺️

說實在的，一杯酒350、400元，還要加收服務費，一個杯子成本多少？
這樣的處理態度有合理？？？

附圖為破杯的原貌
就是很普通的玻璃杯
不是玻璃達人應該沒辦法第一時間知道他多薄🥰","The cup mouth was broken and did not care about the guests at all, and said that it would take 200 cup fees?
Don't recommend everyone to come at all, remember to drink carefully if you want to come 😊

It's really angry, just remember the following fragments.
I came to this bar for a total of 4 cups of alcohol today. Among them, when I drank Mai TAI classic bartending, I drank half of the mouth and broke. At the moment I still spit out two pieces of glass, and my friends helped to inform the waiter. The female store manager did not say that he took away the cup of cup and left. After that, I went to the toilet in order to check whether there were fragments and wounds in the mouth, and then the waiter asked friends to start the following conversation:
Water: Do you need to add some more?
Friends: No
Water: Then we have to charge a cup of 200 yuan
Friends are too late to respond, answered: um
After the friend reacted, he found the waiter to respond.
Friends: Today, the situation of breaking the cup is not broken or maliciously broken, but a seat that breaks at the mouth of the cup. It feels that it is not reasonable to collect the cup.
Water: Okay, let me respond
After that, I returned from the toilet to the position
Response of the waiter: Because this is what our store said, it may be ...
We: Can you find your store manager to discuss?
Waiter: Okay
About five minutes
Store manager: Because you use the cup today, you need to collect a cup fee 200 yuan, but it doesn't matter. Today
We: Because today is a cup mouth, there is no way to ensure whether the cup is completely intact at the time of wine, and there may be cracks.
Store manager: Because there were such problems before there were guests, guests would say that they bite themselves
We: So have such problems before?
Store manager: um
Us: Everyone has a different habit of drinking, and the cup may have problems at that time
Store manager: You have no problem, then we have also confirmed that we have no problem
Us: You have a wonderful processing method like this
Store manager: (I didn't speak)
We: It's okay to checkout. Thank you

Then when receiving the bill (pictured), there is still a cup fee on it. I immediately asked the waiter for the details of this detail. The waiter informed that we helped you deduct.
Should the final details be provided at checkout?IntersectionIntersection
Then go to the door to check out (indeed deduct 200). Before finishing the account, the waiter said: Please be careful next time!
Me: What do you mean?
Waiting: Um is okay
(Who should be careful? Who knows that drinking and drinking a cup can be broken? There have been no such problems before I have been there)

Originally drinking and drinking well, this kind of thing suddenly happened, plus this processing attitude was really very dissatisfied.

After the cup was broken, he didn't care whether the guest was injured at all?Then say that you need to charge a 200 yuan cup fee. Is there a way to confirm that the cup is completely without damage and no cracks?If similar situations have occurred before (and sound more than once), why not start to improve?If you want to change the cup style, please remind the guests before the wine to remind the guest cup. Please pay attention to drink it if you have a cup. If you need to charge a cup fee of 200 yuan, the guest will check the cup first and ""very careful"" drinking. , 2. Change the cup style.

Neither of the two and the processing process and attitude are very bad. It is not recommended everyone to come at all, so as not to be injured and be asked to pay 200 plus a stomach ☺ ☺ ️

To be honest, a cup of wine is 350, 400 yuan, and the service fee is added. What is the cost of a cup?
Is there a reasonable attitude of treatment?IntersectionIntersection

It's very ordinary glass

Bartender介紹的也非常詳細好理解
classic也在水準之上，下次一定還要再去 …","The flavor level of Signature is very good.
Bartender introduced very detailed and well understood
Classic is also on the level, and you must go again next time ..."
充滿趣味，但酒偏淡（也可能是我自己味覺問題）,"Full of interest, but the wine is light (maybe it may be my own taste)"
現在有新酒單了～每杯酒都有它的小故事😉打火機喝起來感覺很養生，牛蒡的味道很特別～阿嬤的梳子是羅勒+微酸感，也很好喝 …,"Now there are new wine list ~ Each glass of wine has its little story. The lighter feels very healthy, and the taste of beef is very special ~ Grandma's comb is Laler+slightly sour, it is also delicious ..."
經營模式太卓越了吧！還沒有入店就有強烈的帶入感。櫃檯人員會悉心介紹入店方式，其中當然包含實名制登記以及重頭戲的典當流程。那天典當了一則故事，雖然離店時還是將商品和故事一併贖回了，不過體驗非常完整、特別。酒單設計和調酒的內涵也是超越很多新興酒吧，光是店內播放的音樂、擺飾、風格營造就大勝。點了芋頭伯youtuber，基酒最多，酒感最重的一款，飲品上頭的芋頭冰淇淋讚不絕口，混入酒裡，風味獨特。是會一去再去的好店！,"The business mode is too outstanding!There is a strong sense of bringing in before entering the store.The counter staff will introduce the way to enter the store, of course, including the real -name registration and the pawn of the highlights.On that day, a story was paid. Although the goods and stories were redeemed together when they left the store, the experience was very complete and special.The connotation of the design and bartender design of the wine list also exceeds many emerging bars. It is a great victory for music, decoration, and style created by the store alone.Order the taro Bo Youtuber, the most foundation and the heaviest wine, the taro ice cream on the drink is praised, mixed in the wine, the flavor is unique.It's a good shop that will go again!"
"老闆很帥很親切，酒很好喝，氣氛很舒服
有趣的一間酒吧","The boss is very handsome and kind, the wine is delicious, the atmosphere is very comfortable
Interesting bar"
外面是保有原來當舖的樣子，裡面翻新裝潢，復古風格非常值得朝聖，甚至可以典當自己的東西換酒，個人覺得特調很好喝也很特別，完全沒有想過的調酒滋味在這裡都可以喝到！是台北相當難得一見的酒吧！,"The outside is the appearance of the original pawnshop. The decoration inside is refurbished. The retro style is worthy of pilgrimage. You can even change your own things to change the wine. Personally, it is very delicious and special. Drink!It is a rare bar in Taipei!"
"典當東西的體驗很有趣，特調的調酒都各有故事，口味也很有特色。
是一間氣氛沉穩舒適的好店。","The experience of a pawn thing is very interesting. The special bartending has its own stories, and the taste is also very distinctive.
It is a good shop with a calm and comfortable atmosphere."
酒不好喝，而且很小杯，冰塊太大融化後影響酒感，除了有特色跟一些噱頭外，一次店,"The wine is not delicious, and it is a small cup. After the ice cubes are too large, the wine affects the wine. In addition to the characteristics and some gimmicks, the shop is"
"進去後，接待的女員工告知所有座位都可以入座，
包含吧台以及牆邊的三人座
但是坐下之後1分鐘，
一位男員工以待會會有其他人數之客人為理由，
要我們移動到別的座位，
而請我們移動座位的員工也沒有說任何的不好意思，
好像我們本來就應該要被動來動去一樣。

那是否一開始可以先搞清楚座位的安排
再請我們入座

所以一進去以後，歡愉感受度瞬間降低了一半
要求我們更換座位以後，
又若無其事地跟我們解說酒單特色，
但當時候其實是聽不太下去他講話的
喝完一杯酒之後，就草草離開
無心眷留，可惜。

雖然換座位不是什麼困難的事情，
但其實就是一種感受問題。","After entering, the receiving female employees informed that all seats can be available.
Including the three -seater of the bar and the wall by the wall
But 1 minute after sitting down,
A male employee on the grounds that there will be a number of other people in the meeting.
Ask us to move to other seats,
And the employees who asked us to move their seats did not say any embarrassment,
It seems that we should have been passively moved.

Can you figure it out at the beginning?
Please take a seat again

So after entering, the joy of joy has been reduced by half an instant
After we ask us to change the seat,
And to explain the characteristics of the wine list without any matter,
But at the time, he couldn't listen very much
After drinking a glass of wine, leave the grass
Unfortunately, unfortunately.

Although it is not difficult to change seats,
But it is actually a problem."
"當鋪在台灣是個很有趣但逐漸沒落的文化，許多人改用線上平台來變賣自身的用品，而這也因此產生了這間店，如果家裡有不想要但有具有故事的東西，都可以拿來這邊點典當。講到典當，就想起了許多在電影或是影集中看到的典當內容，當鋪拿著專業的眼鏡看著鑽石、珠寶或是寶物，講出一個較為低廉的價錢，看賣家是否想要售出，而通常會前去當鋪的都是有緊急金錢需求。不過事實上真是如此嗎？或許也不一定

Be shop holding professional glasses to watch diamonds, jewelry or treasures, and talk about a relatively low price. See if the seller wants to sell it. And usually there are emergency money demand for the pawnshop.But is this really the case?Maybe not necessarily

酒單有更換過，但幾次去都覺得品質很不錯，很有創意也兼具氛圍感的酒吧，很棒～要去記得先訂位！,"The wine list has been replaced, but several times I feel that the quality is very good, very creative and atmospheric bar, great ~ Remember to book a place first!"
Bar很有特色，前身真的是當鋪！調酒除了很特別外，也很好喝，我們ㄧ行人都很滿意❤️Bartender 眯眯很有趣，是會想要再去一次的地方👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 …,"BAR is very distinctive, and the predecessor is really a pawnshop!In addition to being very special, bartending is also very delicious. We are very satisfied with ❤️Bartnder."
特色酒超好喝，老闆超帥，氣氛超好❤️,"The specialty wine is super good, the boss is super handsome, the atmosphere is super good ❤️"
"當鋪改造的酒吧，除了經典調酒外，還有很多創意特調，每杯都很好喝完全不踩雷👌
八天德還會跟你介紹調酒研發背後的故事，讚讚讚
一定會再去！ …","In addition to the classic bartending bar, there are many creative special adjustments, and each cup is delicious.
Eight Tian De will also introduce the story behind you to bartender research and development, praise and praise
Will definitely go again!Mowing"
座位不多，裝潢氣氛自己的個性。Bartender是愛聊天的人。典當遊戲似乎很有趣。特色調酒值得嘗試。,"There are not many seats, and the decoration atmosphere has its own personality.Bartender is a chatter.The pawn game seems to be interesting.Specialty bartending is worth trying."
"酒單的品項很特別，整家店是用當鋪去改的，店內氛圍很不錯，調酒師咪咪相當親切服務用心。

唯一可惜的點是沒有提供炸物，如果能有的話，會更棒。","The quality of the wine list is very special. The entire shop is changed with a pawnshop. The atmosphere in the store is very good. The bartender Mimi is quite intimate.

The only pity is that it does not provide fried objects, and it will be better if it can be available."
"實在是一顆星都不太想給🥲
9點打電話訂位說沒位置，問了前面是否有人候位，店家回答沒有，我們是第一順位。
後來9:30到了店面，店員回答說至少要等到10:30才有位置，我們等了。
後來9點四十幾分又問了一次，另一個店員又說要等到10:45⋯
我們就在附近超商等到了10:45
結果，一通電話也沒有⋯⋯
嗯，真的是蠻疑惑的，我是不懂店家的規矩是如何，但三次詢問都得到不同的答案，到最後不了了之，只能說感覺蠻差的🙃","I really don’t want to give it a star
I called at 9 o'clock and said that there was no place. I asked if someone was waiting before.
Later, I arrived at the store at 9:30, and the clerk replied that at least 10:30 did you have a place. We waited.
Later, I asked again at 9.40 again, and another clerk said that he would wait until 10: 45 ...
We waited at 10:45 at the nearby supermarket
As a result, there is no phone call ...
Well, it is really puzzled. I don’t understand how the rules of the store are, but the three inquiries have received different answers. In the end, I can only say that it feels quite bad."
有趣的酒吧 整體氣氛也很讚,The interesting bar as a whole is also very good
創意調酒和氛圍都特別的店家，店裡放的音樂是早期的華語歌曲，有趣的地方（btw打破酒杯要賠錢，要小心點）,"Creative bartending and atmosphere are special stores. The music in the store is early Chinese songs. Interesting places (BTW breaks the wine glass to lose money, be careful)"
"超有特色酒吧！
不單單是有創意，
高品質基酒+高技術bartender=滿分酒吧
值得再訪的好店，
建議事先上網訂位！","Super special bar!
Not only creative, just
High -quality base wine+high -tech Bartender = full bars
Good store worth visiting,
It is recommended to go online in advance!"
"調酒跟氣氛都不錯

雖然是pub 卻有古早味

洗手間也算乾淨

店內人員都是熱血青年

就是吃食少了點  目前好像只有乾糧類

所以朋友們要用過餐再去喔

你問我會不會再去？！

答案是……………………”會”","Blooming and the atmosphere are good

"當不掉的人生
就用一杯酒解決吧

"客服回覆速度超慢，3/10的23:04留言，也有看到回覆時間為18:00-22:00，這也沒問題

結果等到3/11的20:56才回覆，這也沒問題，但我當下21:01就再詢問其他問題，結果到現在都已經3/12了，相隔2分鐘的問題，就要等到隔天才能收到回覆

這樣的店，想比較現場的服務也是爛到爆，本來很期待很想去，但這就算了","Customer service reply is very slow, and the 23:04 message of 3/10 also sees that the reply time is 18: 00-22: 00, which is no problem.

As a result, it was not a problem until 20:56 of the 3/11, and this was okay, but I asked other questions at 21:01 at the moment. As a result, it has been 3/12 now. Only to receive a reply

Such a store, the service on the scene is also rotten. I was looking forward to going, but this is the case."
"酒很有趣也很好喝
店員親切‪(´•ᴗ• ก )‬՞ ՞","Wine is very interesting and delicious

一樓酒單比酒吧有特色，二樓甜點很好吃，三樓設計公司很有才,The wine list on the first floor is more distinctive than the bar. The dessert on the second floor is very delicious. The design company on the third floor is very talented.

這家酒吧提供獨特的體驗。從外面看，它看起來像一家當舖，甚至外面還掛著「當」的牌子，但實際上，裡面是一家酒吧。他們提供的飲料都有獨特的背景故事，值得一讀。他們的菜單上確實有英文，並且接受本地和外國信用卡作為付款方式。,"This bar offers a unique experience.From the outside, it looks like a pawnshop, and even the ""Dang"" brand is hung outside, but in fact, it is a bar.The drinks they provide have unique background stories, which are worth reading.Their menus do have English, and they accept local and foreign credit cards as payment methods."
"有趣的概念和雞尾酒的製作背後都有故事。這些飲料沒什麼好嘲笑的，它很重，但很精緻，可以平穩地喝下去，然後踢你。

調酒師非常友好，與他們就飲料的想法以及他們如何製作飲料進行了愉快的交談。這個故事是由顧客提交的，他們製作了一種與顧客留下的故事搭配的飲料。","There are stories behind the interesting concepts and cocktails.There is nothing to laugh at these drinks. It is heavy, but it is delicate, can drink smoothly, and then kick you.

The bartender was very friendly, and he had a pleasant conversation with their drinks and how they made drinks.This story is submitted by customers, and they make a drink that is matched with the story left by the customer."
當鋪改造成酒吧。每種飲料都有典當故事和價格。當舖保留了正宗的裝飾和經典台灣當舖的相似之處。雞尾酒融合了當地風味。調酒師（伊凡）很隨和而且專業。,The pawn is transformed into a bar.Each drink has a pawn story and price.The shop retains the similarities of authentic decoration and classic Taiwan pawnshop.The cocktail blends the local flavor.The bartender (Ivan) is very easy -going and professional.
真的很享受這裡的氛圍和音樂！感覺就像在跟現實生活不同的世界哈哈！有一天一定會再來！飲料也很特別，每一杯都讓我們驚嘆不已！,"I really enjoy the atmosphere and music here!It feels like a world different from real life haha ​​haha!Will come again one day!The drink is also very special, and every cup is amazed!"
很酷的酒吧。每一杯飲品都有一個故事。,Very cool bar.Each drink has a story.
小地方。聲音不大。美味又有趣的飲料。小菜單可供選擇。很棒的 11/10 服務。,Small places.The sound is not loud.Delicious and interesting drinks.The small menu is available.Great 11/10 service.
如此獨特的概念！這是一家當舖改建的酒吧。這些飲料具有有趣的台灣影響力，並且非常美味。飲料大約是350-400。,Such a unique concept!This is a bar that is a pawn shop.These beverages have interesting Taiwan influence and very delicious.The drink is about 350-400.
整體來說喝了很棒的飲料！  涼爽的環境和優秀的員工。每人最少飲酒 700 台幣，約 2 杯。,"Overall, I drank a great drink!Cool environment and excellent employees.Each person drinks at least 700 Taiwan dollars, about 2 cups."
雖然氣氛舒適，設計也很漂亮，但酒太平淡，味道也怪怪的。飲料不值這個價錢。,"Although the atmosphere is comfortable and the design is also very beautiful, the wine is too flat and the taste is weird.Drinks are not worth the price."
很棒的地下酒吧風格的酒吧，有著一個很棒的概念——以典當物品為基礎的雞尾酒，業主用這些物品（帶有個人故事）交換飲料。很棒的氛圍，美好的時光。,"The great underground bar style bar has a great concept -cocktail based on pawns items, the owner uses these items (with personal stories) to exchange drinks.A great atmosphere, good time."
很酷的台灣風格酒吧，提供獨特的雞尾酒。,The cool Taiwanese -style bar offers unique cocktails.

"我經歷過的最獨特的酒吧體驗。這家地下酒吧其實是在一家古老的當舖基礎上改建而成的，也是對這段歷史的致敬。你可以典當一件物品並寫一個關於它的故事，商店會用你的故事換取代金券。有些飲料是根據過去顧客的故事改編的。

整個店裡的氣氛非常輕鬆且高端，就像在銀行金庫裡用餐一樣。調酒師是我見過的最友善的。我很高興在這裡度過了一晚！","The most unique bar experience I have experienced.This underground bar is actually converted on the basis of an ancient pawnshop, and it is also a tribute to this history.You can take a item and write a story about it, and the store will use your story to exchange vouchers.Some drinks are adapted from the stories of customers in the past.

The atmosphere in the entire store is very easy and high -end, just like dining in the bank vault.The bartender is the most friendly I have ever seen.I am glad to spend one night here!"
