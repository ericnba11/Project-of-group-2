三個人一共點了2200  是剛好吃到9分飽的程度 再多就不行了 但每一道都很好吃 非常值得💕上菜速度超級快！（尤其是青菜）特別喜歡烤飯糰 表面煎的超級焦脆 超好吃🥹蒜味蛤蜊湯也是一口入魂 喝完很溫潤 身心舒暢～串燒 烤茄子 鯖魚等等都是水準之上✨btw店員很親切 還有提供英文菜單 非常推薦給所有人！,"Three people ordered a total of 2200 to eat just 9 cents full.

"在飲食這件事中的「可惜」有三層，第一層是美中不足，第二層是無緣享用，最高級便是曾經吃過，但卻再也無法品嚐，如果哪天再也吃不到子女，那應該是我人生中的一大憾事

不用多說，東西巨好吃，吃居酒屋不談CP值只談口味跟氣氛，食物基本上無可挑剔，口味、口感都很棒，消費了幾次，平均消費一個人7-800（如果大多都點一些串燒類的話），有點烤飯糰、炒飯的話比較容易飽，可能可以抓個500上下

冰釀梅番茄、塩烤豬五花、醬烤雞皮、七里香、明太子雞腿、酥炸天婦羅、粥品都令人驚艷，建議都要試過，沒有雷點

豬肝、茄子、烤飯糰、拌麵等也都在水準之上，可看個人口味而定

特別拉出來一段褒獎炸豆腐，外表看起來超普通，長得乾癟無趣，但一口咬下後我直接原地漏了兩滴，太瓜張了，這豆腐完美詮釋外酥內嫩這個詞彙，如果十五分鐘前的我因為覺得炸豆腐的上限就只能這樣所以不點，那我肯定是個蠢驢。

附近很適合散步，旁邊就是捷運站，喝酒不怕回不了家，但週末記得預約，以上

12/25 聖誕節晚上又去吃了一次，鮭魚炒飯也好好吃，雞心也有夠讚，以上

1/11 更新，炸魚還有玉米跟鬼一樣，好爽","There are three layers of ""pity"" in the diet. The first layer is inadequate in the United States, the second layer is not to enjoy. , That should be a big regret in my life

Needless to say, things are delicious. Do n’t talk about the CP value when eating izakaya. The food is basically impeccable. The taste and taste are great. If you order some skewers), it is easier to get full if you are a little grilled rice ball and fried rice. You may be able to catch 500 up and down

Ice plum tomatoes, grilled pork pork flowers, sauce roasted chicken skin, Qili Xiang, Ming Prince Chicken leg, fried frying tempura, porridge products are amazing. It is recommended to try it.

Pork liver, eggplant, roasted rice ball, noodles, etc. are also above the standard. You can see the person's taste and determine

In particular, a paragraph of praise fried tofu, the appearance looks super ordinary, grows dry and boring, but after a bite, I leaked two drops directly, too melon, this tofu perfectly interprets the vocabulary of the outer crispy and tender, if ten ten, if ten Five minutes ago, because I felt that the upper limit of fried tofu could only be like this, so I didn't order it, then I must be a stupid donkey.

It is very suitable for walking nearby, next to the MRT station. Drinking is not afraid to return home, but remember to make an appointment on the weekend, the above

-------------------------------

12/25 Christmas evening, I went to eat again again, salmon fried rice is also delicious, and the chicken heart is enough. The above

Update 1/11, fried fish and corn are like ghosts, so cool"
"居酒屋的氣氛很到位。
沙瓦還可以，烏龍口味high ball 第一次喝不太習慣。
在餐點上是蠻喜歡炒水蓮的，又脆又好吃。","The atmosphere of izakaya is in place.
Shava is okay, the oolong taste High Ball is not used to drinking for the first time.
I like stir -fry lotus at meals, crispy and delicious."
"類型 : 串燒店
體驗 :
點了幾種串烤肉類都很美味 , 服務也很OK , 環境乾淨舒適, 座位有分室外與室內, 都可以選坐, 整體而言算是很滿意","Type: skewed shop
Experience:
I ordered a few skewed barbecue to be delicious, the service is also OK, the environment is clean and comfortable, the seats have outdoor and indoors, you can choose to sit."
可以看得出生意真的是蠻好的 所以特別好奇 ! 果然食材方面都還蠻不錯的 蠻新鮮有品質 料理的部分也讓人覺得蠻有創意 跟用心的感覺 有去北投玩想找居酒屋的話可以考慮 !,"It can be seen that the business is really good, so it is particularly curious! Sure enough, the ingredients are quite good, which is quite fresh and quality dishes. Can be considered!"
"多年前吃過一次印象很好，覺得很好吃！

多年後帶妻小來用餐，感覺沒有以前好吃，不知道是不是沒有點到對的餐點🥲CP值也頗低，小可惜。兩大一小用餐3300元

比較推薦的餐點：雞肉丸子、粥","I have been impressed once many years ago, and I feel delicious!

After many years, I took my wife to eat. I felt that I was not delicious before. I do n’t know if I did n’t order the right meal 🥲CP value. It ’s a pity.3300 yuan for two big and one small meal

"七夕最後一刻，想說帶著老婆小孩吃個宵夜，大部分的居酒屋12:00就打烊了，特別挑了一點才打烊的店家。
興沖沖的於11:55到達，店員表明營業到一點，我們也很識相的回覆我們知道，菜單一上來就要求要一次點齊，口氣不是很好，怕我們賴著不走會拖台錢一樣，可以體諒，忙了一天想早點下班。
送餐過程中，剛開始烤好的串燒，還會用盤子裝一下，雖然廚房人員還戴著棉質防熱手套，但起碼還是放在盤子上，等上菜上了一半，直接不演了，戴著棉質手套，拿著肉串就要上菜，手套還不時接觸到烤好的肉串的肉品上，我的小孩跟太太不吃牛肉，也沒有問就把豬肉串放在留有牛肉汁上的碟子上，我都還來不及開口，人就不見了

過了15分鐘粥品才做好。
我跟太太一人裝了一碗粥，過了五分鐘，隔壁桌的椅子已經上了桌子，標準的打烊趕人態勢，我心想不是到一點嗎？
老實說，我並不是很在意，畢竟也知道人家一點打烊。
但是讓人生氣的是，冷氣竟然關了，不是一點打烊嗎？尤其是我們還在吃剛煮好的熱粥！
如果不想接我這組客人，可以拒絕，我絕對可以體諒，但不是用這種方式來表達想要客人離開的態度，這個過程，我不時的回頭看看店員的態度，稱不上友善，只感受到吃快一點，老子要下班的氛圍，
12:30，我實在受不了，匆匆買了單，抱怨了一下，反應冷氣問題，但是竟然得到「裡面哪一台冷氣有開」這樣的回覆，但是，你開一台讓客人吃飯會流汗，一點都不冷的冷氣是要幹嘛？
還好意思說，我有開冷氣，我本人曾經在遠企薈萃樓待過，也做過燒肉店五年的店長，更在連鎖速食餐飲待過十年，說實話，以這樣的服務，你們的價格絕對對不起消費者。

1.我沒有拖你們的下班時間
2.你們沒有關心顧客用餐情況
3.你們用餐的氛圍很糟

總之
我不會再來了⋯⋯
最後
附上消費明細
以免被人說是同業來找碴

PS點這麼一堆東西
烹調加上用餐時間
只花了30分鐘
我也是很佩服我自己","At the moment of the Qixi Festival, I wanted to say that I took a supper with my wife and children.
Xing Chong arrived at 11:55. The clerk stated that it was a bit of business, and we also responded to it. We know that when the menu comes up, we ask for a little bit. You can be considerate. After a busy day, you want to get off work early.
During the meal delivery process, the baked skewers were started, and they would be installed with a plate. Although the kitchen staff wearing cotton -proof hot gloves, at least it was placed on the plate. It is worn with cotton gloves, and the meat skewers have to be served. From time to time, the gloves are touched on the roasted meat skewers. My child and wife do not eat beef, nor do they put the pork on the pork. On the dish on the beef juice, I was too late to speak, and people disappeared

After 15 minutes, the porridge was done.
My wife and I installed a bowl of porridge alone. After five minutes, the chair of the next table had already been on the table. The standard snooze rushed to catch people. Isn't it a little bit?
Honestly, I don't care very much, after all, I also know that people are snoring.
But what makes people angry is that the air -conditioning is turned off, isn't it a little snoring?Especially we are still eating hot porridge!
If you don't want to pick up my group of guests, you can refuse, I can definitely be considerate, but not in this way to express the attitude of wanting the guests to leave. In this process, I look back at the attitude of the clerk from time to time. Feel the atmosphere of eating fast, Lao Tzu is going to work,
12:30, I couldn't stand it. I hurriedly bought the order and complained to reflect the problem of air -conditioning, but I got a reply such as ""which one in the air -conditioning inside"", but you open a one to let the guests sweat sweat for dinner. What do you want to do without cold air at all?
Fortunately, I have air -conditioning. I have been in the distant enterprise. I have been in the distant enterprise. I have also been a store manager who has been a roasted meat shop for five years. Your price is definitely sorry for consumers.

1. I did not drag your get off work time
2. You do not care about the customer's meal situation
3. The atmosphere of your meal is bad

Reason
I won't come again ...

"炒物跟烤物都好吃，可惜沒補到一夜干的照片，另外明太子山藥推薦。
葡萄沙瓦用於解膩，好喝！
氛圍跟服務都很可以～～","The frying and grilled items are delicious, but unfortunately it did not make up the photos of drying overnight.
Grape sauce is used for decomposition, delicious!
The atmosphere and service are very good ~~"
"氣氛不錯的居酒屋。在北投旅遊夜宿溫泉飯店後的晚餐。
沙瓦不錯，high ball 烏龍口味 第一次喝不太習慣😅","Hakuya with good atmosphere.Dinner after the Hot Spring Hotel in Beitou Tourism Night.
Salva is good, High Ball oolong tastes the first time it is not used to drinking 😅"
"店內座位少
想要坐戶外的朋友可以先噴防蚊液再入坐
餐點都還蠻好吃的","There are few seats in the store
Friends who want to take outdoors can spray the anti -mosquito liquid before sitting in
The meals are quite delicious"
"先談服務，這間絕對「不是」親子友善的餐廳，縱然訂枱時已告訴店主我們會帶一名兩歲多小孩，但最後被安排到戶外高腳椅，安排到戶外座不是問題，因為可以看看街景，但餐廳是沒有兒童高椅可提供，戶外餐枱不穩固亦是很大的問題，餐桌只是用一張圓形木板蓋在一個大鐵桶上，用手按是可翻桌的。
小孩子得兩歲多，用餐是我們要抱着他，又要防備小孩子打翻枱上的餐具，那張圓形枱不是固定的，可以完全翻過來，我們看到隔離有一張四人木椅木枱，坐了半小時也不見客人到，問問侍應可否轉枱，他們的回答是「絕對不能」」！ ！ ！到我們埋單時，那張四人枱仍是沒有人坐的，我非常不理解店員的安排！

食物方面是OK的，我們一餐吃了台幣琴晚2000 多元，食物質素是OK的，特別是清酒煮蜆，蜆非常飽滿，湯是很鮮甜的。","Let's talk about the service first. This is definitely ""not"" a friendly and friendly restaurant. Even when I booked a platform, I have told the owner that we will bring a two -year -old child, but it is finally arranged to the outdoor tall chair. You can see the street view, but the restaurant is not available for children's high chairs. The outdoor dining table is also a big problem. The dining table is just covered on a large iron barrel with a round wooden board. of.
Children are more than two years old. Dining is that we have to hold him, and we must prevent children from fighting the tableware. The circular platform is not fixed and can be completely turned over. We see that there is a four -person wood in isolation. The chair and wooden platform did not see the guests when they sat for half an hour. Ask the waiter if they could turn to the platform. Their answer was ""absolutely not""!IntersectionIntersectionWhen we paid the bill, the four -person platform was still no one. I didn't understand the arrangement of the clerk!

In terms of food, we have a meal for more than 2,000 yuan in a meal. The food quality is OK, especially the sake boiled cricket. The soup is very full and the soup is very sweet."
"餐點中規中矩
適合跟朋友聚餐聊天的地方
店內油煙味有點重
發現吃了人均快800有點驚訝，價位偏高","Meal is quite satisfactory
Suitable for meals and chats with friends
The smell of oil fume in the store is a bit heavy
I found that eating a per capita is a little surprised, and the price is high"
"回訪多次了，口袋名單的愛店之一。
每串都好吃！一上桌就掃光了😂
雞肉串/魚下巴/手羽先，皆是表皮略焦脆、香氣撲鼻，肉質鮮嫩。
牛豬肉串的熟度恰到好處，調味適中，能吃到食材的本味。

飲品的部分，螞蟻人推薦冬瓜檸檬，另外紅茶甜酒個人非常喜歡！
各類的果實酒也很棒，不愛喝酒的朋友也能輕易入口！","I have returned many times, one of the love shops on the pocket list.
Each string is delicious!Sweeps it at the table
Chicken skewers/fish chin/hand feathers are the first, all are slightly crispy, fragrant, and tender meat.
The cookedness of beef pork skewers is just right, the seasoning is moderate, and the taste of ingredients can be eaten.

In the drinking part, ants recommend winter melon lemon. In addition, black tea sweet wine personally likes it!
Various kinds of fruit wines are also great, friends who do not like to drink can easily enter the entrance!"
"小而美，適合冬天用餐聊天 。最特別的是居酒屋他們有賣粥品，雖然不是市面上料多豐富口味層次的粥，應該是炊，他們的粥是綿密細緻，沒有過多的調味，帶一點胡椒香及蛤蜊的鮮甜，蛤蜊飽滿多汁 ，都是當天新鮮採購的，真是不錯 。
店面座位不多，有室內及戶外座位，在下班後大概7-8點都會陸續有人進來小酌閒聊，愈晚愈多人，而我們只是來吃吃晚餐填補胃口 。客人很多除要預約外，餐點要先點好 。
其次，菜單非常豐富，從冷物、吸物、炒食、甜點、串燒、炊粥應有盡有，飲品則有無酒精～沙瓦、啤酒、甚至也有韓國燒酒，冬瓜檸檬首推，另除了菜單上的餐點，小黑板上都有每日限定菜單 。","Small and beautiful, suitable for dining and chatting in winter.The most special is that at izakaya, they have porridge selling porridge. Although they are not more ingredients on the market, they are rich in porridge. They should be cooking. Their porridge is dense and delicate, without excessive seasoning, with a little pepper and clam. The clams are full and juicy, all of which are freshly purchased that day, which is really good.
There are not many seats in the store. There are indoor and outdoor seats. At about 7-8 o'clock after get off work, someone will come in and have a drink and chat.Many guests have to make an appointment, and order meals first.
Secondly, the menu is very rich.

"日式氛圍的居酒屋
燒烤串不錯吃，偏甜口
若點單支的烤串有些店員會放在面前的盤子上，不太喜歡被放這裡，因為可能會碰到櫃檯牆面，建議可以留意改善一下
雖然是居酒屋但是酒類很普通
整體上還是不錯的","Izakaya in Japanese -style atmosphere
Barbecue skewers are good, sweet
If you order a single skewers, some clerks will put it on the plate in front of them, and you don't like to be put here, because you may encounter the wall of the counter. It is recommended to pay attention to improve it.
Although it is izakaya, the wine is very ordinary
Overall is good"
北投最棒的居酒屋🏮很好吃，服務貼心，已經回訪多次，子女醬烤飯糰🍙和醬烤手羽先很好吃，喜歡海苔醬，水蓮滿大盤的，鹽烤鯛魚下巴超好吃很大份也烤的很香必點！薰香紅茶甜酒很好喝，可惜沒有外賣，是店家自己調的，有點小杯（遺憾🤣）且冰塊有點多，希望可以大杯一點，但很推薦可以點來配食物喔👍🏻,"Beitou's best izakaya is delicious and intimate. It has been visited many times. Children's sauce grilled rice balls and sauce grilled hand feathers are delicious first. Eat a lot of sake and roast it, it must be fragrant!Xiangxiang black tea sweet wine is delicious, but unfortunately there is no takeaway, it is adjusted by the store itself, a little cup (regrettable) and there are a lot of ice cubes. I hope it can be a little cup, but it is recommended to order food."
不太懂為什麼生意這麼好，或許是我個人問題，甜不辣炸到會苦，炒高麗菜裡面很多黑黑的東西(或許是蒜頭炒焦了)也沒有清甜，黃金泡菜的刺激感很重，松坂豬很韌，串燒的肉不分雞豬牛都破柴，很難得吃到這些安全牌品項可以不好吃的，唯一能說得上好吃的就那個拌麵，然後不知道為什麼串燒上菜是服務生從另一個盤子直接用手放到桌上的公盤，用個夾子不是比較衛生嗎？也不是說很平價的店，來玩的時候在高朋滿座的店吃到這樣的品質真的滿失望的,"I don't know why the business is so good, maybe my personal problem, sweet and not bitterness, it will be bitter, and a lot of black things in the stir -fry (maybe the garlic is fried). Heavy, Matsuzaka pigs are tough. The skewers of the skewers are not divided into chickens, pigs and cattle, and it is difficult to eat these safety brand items. The only one can be delicious. Knowing why the skewers are serving the food from another plate to put the public plate directly on the table from another plate. Isn't it more hygienic with a clip?It is not to say that a very affordable store. When I came to play"
餐點好好吃！而且也不貴，口袋名單寶藏店家+1，老闆店員們都很客氣、態度非常好！太讚了，好驚艷！掃去了我整天得不愉快，果然最能療癒人心的是美食，下次再來~,"The meal is delicious!And it ’s not expensive, the pocket list treasure shop +1, the owner and shop staff are very polite and very good!It's so praised, so amazing!After sweeping away, I was unhappy all day. Sure enough, the best healing is the food. Come again next time ~"
"東西不到難吃，但也沒有什麼令人驚艷的
串燒跟自己在家用電烤盤烤出來的差不多
要點櫛瓜不如回家自己煎就好
就是普到不行但偏貴的居酒屋

服務人員態度也冷冷淡淡的
說實在的不知道為何評價這麼高🤔
吃了超級後悔，真的不要被評價給騙了","It is not unpalatable, but there is no amazing
Stringing is almost the same as that of my home electric baking tray at home
It's better to have a little melon to fry yourself by yourself
It is the izakaya that is not good but expensive

The attitude of the service staff is also cold and faint
To be honest, I don’t know why the evaluation is so high 🤔
I regret it after eating, really don't be deceived by the evaluation"
"🥩肉串類：

牛肉串一送上來吃第一口馬上知道為什麼他們家生意那麼好，醬烤/起司都超好吃，牛肉烤得正好，香又多汁，完全不乾不柴，超讚。

手羽先（雞翅）也很好吃沒有腥味！醬料有醃入味。

唯獨柚子胡椒雞腿稍鹹，但肉本身還是烤得很好吃。

🍙澱粉類：

醬烤飯糰 - 就是一顆飯糰，裡面沒包東西。烤得正好、不軟不爛，外面滿滿海苔粉，海苔控會很愛。

明太子山藥 - 脆的，上面鋪滿明太子醬，超超超超超超超好吃。

🍺喝的：

梅子沙瓦 - 清爽解膩，不會死甜，份量也很阿莎力，邊吃邊喝不會一下就喝光了。

星期天傍晚一個人walk-in，很幸運有位置，而且外場妹妹們服務很周到，反應快很貼心。

假日一個人低消500，點了四個串、一個明太子山藥、一個烤飯糰、一杯沙瓦，大概700多，女生一個人吃很正好，吃完很飽。

As soon as the beef skewers are given up to eat the first bite, they will know why their business is so good. The sauce and the cheese are super delicious. The beef is grilled just right.

Hand Yu Xian (chicken wings) is also delicious without fishy smell!The sauce is marinated.

Only grapefruit pepper chicken legs are slightly salty, but the meat itself is still delicious.

服務上我覺得做到基本服務，店員都已經忙不過來了，要體諒一下店家，不能要求太多。","The store is not big and the meals are very good. I personally recommend cod liver cold trays and skewers.
In terms of service, I think that the basic service is done, the clerk is already too busy. We must be considerate of the store, not too much."

They are not provided with the service fee but the service is very thoughtful.The shop is small and warm in the store, I like it very much 温

週末晚上提前預約朋友過生日，價格也不比其他居酒屋貴，而且只有我們，老闆一直播放韓國歌曲，以後我們吃蛋糕時，還播放了生日歌！ 食物也很好吃，7個人去了！

주말 밤에 친구 생일 축하하러 미리 예약하고 갔었는데 가격도 다른 이자카에 비해 비싸지도 않았고 또 테이블에 저희 밖에 없었는데 계속 한국 노래도 틀어주시고 케이크 먹으려고 하니깐 생일축하 노래도 틀어주셨어요!! 음식도 너무 맛있었구요 7명이소 갔습니다!","晚 上 預 預 友 生 生 日

I reserved my friend's birthday on the weekend night, but the price was not expensive compared to other Izaka, and we only had on the table.The food was so delicious. 7 people went!"
"忘記拍照，餐點很好吃。串燒好吃！五花肉串燒超香又Juicy，雜炊粥居然熬到看不見米粒，非常驚喜。桃子沙瓦很好喝，整體而言非常滿意。

店內氣氛和環境不會令人感到吵雜，帶小孩吃起來也很舒服。","Forgot to take pictures, the meal is delicious.Skewers are delicious!The pork belly skewers are super fragrant and juice. The mixed cooking porridge actually boiled into the rice grains, which was very surprised.Taozi Shava is delicious and very satisfied as a whole.

The atmosphere and environment in the store will not make people feel noisy, and it is comfortable to take children."

東西也好吃，會再回訪！","The atmosphere in this izakaya is great
It's very suitable to come here with three or five friends when they get off work here
Things are delicious, and they will return to visit again!"
吃一口烤串就知道不簡單。每一道料理都是用心的傑作！太美味了忙著吃沒拍照。海鮮粥也是精典。平常不愛吃肉的我都吃到加點！！記得要預約才吃的到喔👍👍👍,"It is not easy to eat a skewers.Every cuisine is a masterpiece!It's so delicious, busy eating and not taking pictures.Seafood porridge is also classic.I usually eat more if I do n’t like to eat meat!IntersectionRemember to make an appointment before eating it 👍👍👍"
"來北投泡溫泉時找到這家居酒屋小酌🏮在冷冷的天喝燒酌很讚！結果發現食物也超美味，一不小心就吃太飽啦！

在此必須先大推，串燒類必點「山葵黑羽雞腿」，肉質超嫩又多汁，搭配哇沙米口感層次更上一層！就算不點雞腿，也一定要試試山葵的口味。其他串燒口味我們有點鹽烤、醬烤、海苔椒鹽，覺得都沒有山葵好吃。

其他非串燒類的品項也都好好吃，明太子山藥永遠不敗！帶皮鹽烤茭白筍、醬燒豬肝、味噌脆皮豆腐、胡麻過貓都很不賴，完全不踩雷。至於炸牡蠣和松阪炒水蓮好吃但略普通。

蛤蜊老火雞炊粥以及愛嗆麵聽說是必點，前者的口感上非常特別，是熬到吃不出粥感的粥，至於調味上偏清淡。後者真的超辣，可是好好吃，但不吃辣的人奉勸不要輕易嘗試。

甜點部分，有品嘗冰釀梅番茄以及碳烤麻糬，都給過關！

總結：
💡非常好吃，會想再二訪！
💡店內空間蠻小的，記得要先打電話訂位。","When I came to the North Tubo Hot Spring, I found this atrium and a drink.It was found that the food was also super delicious, and I was too full if I accidentally!

Here we must push it first. The skewers must order ""Yamana Black Feather Chicken Legs"". The meat is super tender and juicy. It is more layer of the layer of the wow Sami taste layer!Even if you don't order chicken legs, you must try the taste of Shanki.We have a skewed flavor. We have a little salt, sauce, and seaweed salt, and I feel that there is no delicious sunflower.

Other non -skewers are also delicious.Bringing white bamboo shoots with leather salt, pork liver, miso crispy tofu, and bells are not bad, and they do not step on the thunder.As for fried oysters and Matsusaka fried lotus lotus, it is delicious but slightly ordinary.

The old turkey porridge porridge and love noodles heard that it is necessary. The former taste is very special. It is the porridge that can not eat porridge. As for the flavor, the seasoning is light.The latter is really super spicy, but it is delicious, but people who do not eat spicy advise not to try it easily.

In the dessert, there are tasting ice -brewed tomatoes and carbon roasted hemps, all of which have passed!

Summarize:
再 Very delicious, I want to visit again!
小 The space in the shop is quite small, remember to call the place first."
"和朋友泡完溫泉過來吃，顧著聊天忘了拍照🤣🤣
座位有分內外區，戶外區可以噴一下防蚊液再就坐，個人覺得粥品吃起來很不錯，朋友是很愛這邊的各種肉串，不過本人這陣子腸胃炎沒辦法吃⋯就沒辦法給什麼評價，只能下次再來吃囉","After soaking in the hot spring with friends, I talked about chatter and forgot to take pictures 🤣🤣
The seats are divided into internal and external areas. The outdoor area can spray the anti -mosquito liquid and then sit. I personally think that the porridge tastes very good. My friend loves all kinds of meat skewers here, but I ca n’t eat gastroenteritis at this time. What kind of evaluation is given, you can only eat again next time"
"很常經過這家店,用餐時刻常有人在排隊,和友人初訪用餐.覺得餐點的串燒.炸物.烤物都很不錯吃,下次有機會再來品嚐看看不同的菜色。","I often pass through this shop. People are often lined up at the time of dining. They first visited their friends. They felt that the skewers of the meal. The fried materials. Bakes were very good. Next time, there is a chance to taste different dishes."
2023年4月週末晚餐walk in，覺得做外面空氣比較清新一點，畢竟裡面人多比較擠。價錢還是比較合理的居酒屋，品質也不錯，滿喜歡澱粉類主餐的，份量比較大，可以吃飽。推薦宵夜來小酌吃串，當熱炒店點的話大概會哭。,"In the dinner in the April 2023 weekend, I felt that the air was fresher. After all, there were more crowded people inside.The price is still more reasonable, and the quality is also good. If you like the main meal of starch, the portion is relatively large and you can eat.It is recommended to eat a skewers for supper. When the hot stir -fry shop, I will probably cry."
"雜炊的蝦子大隻鮮甜又彈牙
粥體煮的很透很黏滑
烤串很好吃，哇沙米加雞肉很對味","Miscellaneous shrimp is fresh and sweet and elastic
The porridge body is very transparent and sticky
The baking skewers are delicious, Wakshamiaga chicken is very right"
食物都很好吃，個人喜好熱食大於串燒，感覺粥品、烏龍麵是店家強項🤩串燒推手打雞肉丸、醬燒牛、奶油洋蔥！芒果梅酒好喝👍🏽,The food is delicious. Personal preferences are greater than skewers. I feel that porridge and oolong noodles are the store's strengths.Mango plum wine is delicious 梅
氣氛跟料理都在水準之上，價格也屬物有所值。［極鮮蛤蠣老火雜炊粥］、和［碳烤手作麻糬］是我每次必點的。太久沒吃還會懷念呢⋯⋯🤭,"The atmosphere and cooking are above the standard, and the price is worth it.[Extremely Fresh Oyster Old Fire Miscellaneous Porridge], and [Carbon Roasted Hand as Maisha] I must order every time.I still miss it for too long, I still miss it ..."

粥嗯真的非常好吃，看起來平淡粥品，味道非常鮮美，粥熬的很爛，鹹甜適中，粥體比中卷還搶眼，中卷很鮮甜，川燙的口感剛好，串燒非常好吃，外表焦脆有焦糖化剛好的口味，內部肉汁四溢，師傅技術非常棒，比較可惜是雞腿肉體有個腥味，不確定怎麼來的，但師傅技術實在太棒，不給五星對不起自己，內部座位少，要坐到外面，是家非常棒的居酒屋,"The porridge is really delicious, it looks plain porridge, the taste is very delicious, the porridge is very rotten, the salty is moderate and sweet, the porridge body is more eye -catching than the middle roll. Very delicious, the appearance is crispy with caramel, and the internal gravy overflows. The master's skills are great. Unfortunately, the chicken legs have a fishy smell.

歡迎喜愛美食的大家追蹤唷🫶🏻

這間是在地人首推居酒屋！沒訂位真的很難吃到！至少要提早一週訂比較保險，整間在餐點的部分，以本次用餐經驗完全沒有雷！超滿意😊

唯一缺點大概就是位置有點太窄，桌面太小🤔

這是一間超級值得收到口袋名單的居酒屋🥹

🔸極鮮蛤蜊老火雞炊粥
這個粥真的是心頭好！每個蛤蜊很肥美，一口吃下去真的是超鮮！非常符合極鮮這二個字；粥體本身是煲粥的口感，而且融合老火雞和蛤蜊的精華，這種我最愛！就算天氣超熱，一整鍋也還是完食😋

🔸明太子山藥
每個山藥咬起來很脆爽，搭配滿滿的明太子，香濃的味道和脆脆的口感真的很絕配🥰

🔸松阪炒水蓮
蔬菜的品項上只要有水蓮就是必點！因為水蓮要好吃一定要有鍋氣！水蓮吃起來才會脆脆又多汁！這間的水蓮很可以！而且滿大份的😂

🔸烤玉米
這個玉米一開始看到覺得好像烤的有點乾？但是一口咬下去，真的是滿多汁的！而且是水果玉米，滿滿的玉米甜味，真的是很讚❤️

🔸胡麻過貓
這是夏日的居酒屋必點開胃菜！冰冰涼涼的過貓搭配濃郁的胡麻醬，真的是讓人一口接一口停不下來😆

🙋🏻‍♀️：其實我還吃一堆串燒，但太餓了，完全來不急拍，直接被我吃完了！哈哈哈哈哈🤭","IIg: jjiiee._
Welcome everyone who loves food to track 爱 🫶🏻 🫶🏻

This is the first place in the locals!It's really hard to eat without a reservation!At least one week earlier to book more insurance, the whole part of the meal is completely without thunder with this dining experience!Super satisfied 😊

The only disadvantage is that the location is a bit too narrow, and the desktop is too small.

This is a izakaya that is super worth receiving the list of pockets.

火 Extreme clam old turkey cooking porridge
This porridge is really good!Each clam is very fat, and it is really super fresh!It is very in line with the two words very fresh; the porridge body itself is the taste of porridge, and the essence of the old turkey and clams is combined. This kind of favorite!Even if the weather is super hot, a whole pot is still eaten 😋

Prince Yama Yam
Each yam bites very crispy, with a full prince, the flavor and crispy taste are really perfect.

🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸
As long as there is water lotus in the product of vegetables!Because water lotus must be delicious, you must have a pot!Water lotus tastes crispy and juicy!This water lotus is fine!And full of large portions

Baked corn
At first this corn saw it as if it was a bit dry?But if you bite it, it is really juicy!And it is fruit corn, full of sweetness of corn, it is really great ❤️

🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸 🔸
This is a must -order dish in the summer izakaya!The cold and cool cat with strong flax sauce is really making people stop without stopping.

一️: Actually, I still eat a bunch of skewers, but I am too hungry.Hahahahaha"
提供了一個放鬆的社交環境，讓人能在輕鬆的氣氛中享受美食與酒類。食物種類豐富，從燒烤到烤魚片，滿足不同口味,"A relaxed social environment allows people to enjoy food and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere.Food is rich in types, from barbecue to grilled fish slices to satisfy different flavors"
在北投居酒屋本來就不多而且一般座位都很少，這一家也不例外，店內座位不多，桌距過近，整體用餐體驗不算很舒適。但是人實在很多若想來一定要訂位.上菜也是比較慢，整體的體驗是還可以.燒烤類都讓人有些失望，餐點內唯一讓人驚艷的只有炸雞軟骨，調味恰當，十分下酒。周.粥品表現也很平淡。飲料酒品不錯。可以推薦！,"There are not many in Nomoto, and there are very few seats. This one is no exception. There are not many seats in the store, the table is too close, and the overall dining experience is not very comfortable.However, a lot of people must book a place if you want to come. It is also slow to serve. The overall experience is okay. Barbecue is a bit disappointed. The only stunning chicken cartilage in the meal is properly seasoned. Get wine.Zhou. Porridge performance is also bland.Drinks and wines are good.It can be recommended!"
已經來過不知道幾次了，每次外面都是擠滿了人，食材新鮮！肉質鮮嫩！這次點了蛤蠣，蛤蠣保留了原本的湯汁，鮮甜又不腥！,"I have been here, I do n’t know how many times, every time the outside is full of people, the ingredients are fresh!Fresh meat!This time I ordered the oyster, and the oysters retained the original soup, fresh and not fishy!"
剛吃一口烤肉串就知道不簡單。每一道料理都是很用心的傑作！太美味了忙著吃沒拍照就吃光了。海鮮粥也是經典好吃。,"Just take a bite of barbecue skewers.Each dish is a masterpiece!It's so delicious, busy eating and taking pictures.Seafood porridge is also classic."
跨年來的，第一次來就覺得好棒！店裡面氣氛很好，餐點也很好吃，跨年倒數第時候店家還會一起乾杯慶祝，今年跨年跟朋友一起來，真的很開心~,"Over the years, it feels great for the first time!The atmosphere in the store is very good, and the meals are also delicious. When the New Year's end countdown, the store will toast together. This year, I will come with friends this year. I am really happy ~"
"跟朋友點了幾種串烤肉類都很美味 , 服務也很OK , 環境乾淨舒適, 蠻適合小聚會, 整體而言算是很滿意","I ordered a few skewers with friends to be delicious, the service is also OK, the environment is clean and comfortable, it is quite suitable for small gatherings. Overall, I am very satisfied"
"這家真的不會雷 ！ 必須吃🥹
鹽烤豬五花不得了  直接排行榜第一名🥇
還有鹽烤牛小排直接化開
到底是怎麼烤的
口感超像棉花糖 但是非常多汁

還有那個炸黃金海鱺魚腹肉

一口接著一口停不下來

真的要挑毛病的話
唯一節瓜沒有入味 醬跟瓜是分開的
帳單上每一個都很好吃😋","This one really won't be thunder!Must eat 🥹
Salt grilled pig's five flowers can not be ranked first in the directly ranking list 🥇
There are also salt grilled beef steaks directly
How did it bake
The taste is super like marshmallow but very juicy

And that fried golden sea catfish belly meat
The crispy appearance is a soft texture inside
I can't stop after a bite

If you really want to pick a problem
The only section of melon is separated and melon is separated
Every one on the bill is delicious 😋"
"粥的部分真的又濃稠又香，肉的部分雖然份量不大但味道很好，店裡的煙味燒烤味不重👍
唯有豬肝熟度不均、跟天婦羅不太推","The porridge part is really thick and fragrant. Although the meat is not large, it tastes good, and the smoke flavor in the store is not heavy.
Only the pork liver maturity is uneven, and the misert is not pushed too much"
"雖然店面小小的，客人很多，但服務態度很好，讓人有一秒在日本的錯覺。
豬肝是最意外而好吃的一道菜色，如果敢吃內臟的人不要錯過☺️
雞軟骨除了椒鹽部分，底部佐上洋蔥倒是清爽，非常喜歡。
串燒基本表現都很好，無論是雞胸、雞腿、豬五花或是牛，肉質都蠻不錯的，是完全撐得了檯面的菜色；
若真要說的話，大概是真的會與隔壁前後左右距離有點相近，如果想好好暢聊的話可得稍稍斟酌一下囉😄","Although the store is small and has a lot of guests, the service attitude is very good, which makes people have a second in Japan.
Pork liver is the most unexpected and delicious dish. If you dare to eat the internal organs, don’t miss it ☺️
In addition to the salt and pepper part of the chicken cartilage, the onion is refreshing at the bottom and likes it very much.
Basic performance of skewers is very good. Whether it is chicken breasts, chicken legs, pigs, or beef, the meat is pretty good, it is completely supported by the table;
If you really want to say, it will really be a bit similar to the distance from the front, back, left and right next door. If you want to chat well, you can consider it a little."
服務親切，餐點好吃，環境舒服且乾淨，適合跟朋友聚餐的首選，推薦～～！👍🏻,"The service is cordial, the meals are delicious, the environment is comfortable and clean, and it is suitable for the first choice for meals with friends. Recommended ~~!Bleak"
"離捷運站近走路約五分鐘可到達，店面佈置濃濃日本🇯🇵味，讓人ㄧ秒到日本，頗有偽出國的感覺，思念日本的人趕快來，店內位置不多，建議一定要先訂位，不然可就吃不到唷！
餐點平價CP值高，服務人員熱情細心服務很好，會先詢問是否有來過，對於餐點作介紹，菜單分類清楚，讓人ㄧ目瞭然，入口上方牆面還有菜單上沒有的菜，想點直接告訴服務人員就可以囉！只是字小品項多，看來有些亂，對於長輩或視力不佳者，讀取資訊不易，建議可以找人設計ㄧ下。
子女私房下酒菜很特別，口感脆香，融合糯米椒、洋蔥，讓人忍不住一口接一口。粥品也很美味，桌上擺著的長盤是供來放烤串，令人感到印象深刻的是烤豬肝，肉質軟Q醬香，好好吃😋但烤出來要趕快吃喔！
烤物及炸物、青菜都很美味，好適合三五好友相約一起來，下酒聊天超紓壓，下次再去挑戰魚類～(o^^o)好吃😋的店家推薦給大家。","It can be arrived in about five minutes from the MRT station. The storefront layout is strong in Japan, which makes people feel like a pseudo -abroad. Those who miss Japanese come quickly. Book the seat first, otherwise you won't eat it!
Meals have a high CP value, and the service staff is very enthusiastic and carefully served. I will ask if I have had it. Introduce the meal, the menu classification is clear, and people are clear. If you want to tell the service staff directly, you can let it go!It ’s just that there are a lot of words. It seems a bit chaotic. For those who have poor elders or have poor vision, it is not easy to read information. It is recommended to find someone to design.
The children's private house is very special, with crispy and fragrant taste, blending glutinous rice peppers and onions, making people can't help but take a bite.The porridge is also very delicious. The long plates on the table are for baking skewers. What is impressive is roasted pork liver. The meat is soft and the flavor of the meat is delicious.
Baked objects, fried objects, and green vegetables are delicious. It is suitable for three or five friends to meet together. The drinking and chatting are superb pressure. The next time you will challenge the fish ~ (o ^^ o) the delicious shops are recommended to everyone."
店內座位不多，桌距過近，整體用餐體驗不算很舒適。整體的燒烤類都讓人有些失望，餐點內唯一讓人驚艷的只有炸雞軟骨，調味恰當，十分下酒。松阪豬炒水蓮沒有鍋味，表現也很平淡。冬瓜檸檬喝起來有種奇怪的味道外也很淡薄。,"There are not many seats in the store, the table is too close, and the overall dining experience is not very comfortable.The overall barbecue is a bit disappointed. The only amazing thing in the meal is fried chicken cartilage. The seasonings are appropriate and are very wine.Matsusaka pig fried lotus lotus has no pot flavor, and its performance is also bland.Winter melon lemon has a strange taste and is also very weak."
"北投人氣居酒屋，建議先訂位或先致電詢問。
上菜速度快，很容易塞爆桌面。店員未主動說明季節性商品，結帳時才告知。

鮭魚炒飯：料多實在，粒粒分明
薑絲蛤蜊湯：有蛤蜊未吐沙，有些驚嚇
燒烤類：火候控制得宜，肉汁飽滿
酒精類飲品：有誠意","Beitou is popular in the izakaya. It is recommended to book a place or call first.
The speed of serving is fast, and it is easy to plug the desktop.The clerk did not take the initiative to explain the seasonal commodity and informed it at the checkout.

Salmon fried rice: more ingredients, clear grains
Ginger Clam Decoction: There are clams without vomiting sand, a little scared
Barbecue: The heat is well controlled, the gravy is full
Alcoholic drinks: sincerity"
"來北投泡湯住宿，炎熱的夏日沒什麼胃口，剛好搜到這間居酒屋，看評價不錯，來試吃看看，果然很適合我們口味！
簡單的小店，價格也親民，是頓讓我們吃的滿意又滿足的一餐！👍","Come to the north to stay in the past, and there is no appetite for the hot summer. I just found this izakaya. It is good to see the evaluation. Let's try it. It really is suitable for our taste!
Simple shops, the price is also affordable, it is a meal that allows us to eat satisfaction and satisfaction!Bleak"
串烤保有食材的甜味及肉汁，好吃。喜歡鹽烤甚於醬烤。喜歡雞丸子、雞胗、日本茄子、櫛瓜，嗆麵也好吃😋,"String to keep the sweetness and gravy of ingredients, delicious.I like salt grilled than sauce.I like chicken balls, chicken 本, Japanese eggplants, gourds, and noodles are delicious."
生意很好，建議可以先訂位，上菜速度很快！推薦：鮭魚炒飯料多實在，燒烤類也很好吃。,"The business is very good. It is recommended to order first, and the food is fast!Recommendation: The salmon fried rice is so real, and the barbecue is also delicious."
除了烤麻糬外，幾乎每一道都非常美味，服務態度親切，空間雖說不大，但人潮絡繹不絕，當日特殊菜色會寫在黑板，建議點選。,"Except for baking hemp, almost every one is very delicious and has a kind attitude. Although the space is not large, the crowd is endless. Special dishes on the day will be written on the blackboard. It is recommended to click on it."
"近北投捷運站，附近也有停車場，交通算是蠻方便的。店內座位數不多，臨時訂位只有戶外座位，而且也很快就客滿了，生意很好。
主打粥品、海鮮、串燒、手作，基本都是以串計價，肉類約$40-$65/串，以他在北投這個價格不算貴。
我們沒點粥和海鮮，有一道澎湖牡蠣10顆 $200真是蠻心動的，可惜男朋友不愛，所以這次純粹只點串燒類。
座位少建議訂位，粥品和海鮮爬文看評價都不錯，有興趣的朋友可以試試。
串燒吃起來覺得還不錯，可惜醬汁比較不是我愛的口味，比較清淡一點（本人重口味）所以沒有特別驚艷的感覺。","There are parking lots near the North Investment Station near the North, and the transportation is quite convenient.The number of seats in the store is not large. The temporary reservation is only outdoor seats, and it is full of fullness. The business is very good.
The main porridge, seafood, skewers, and hand work are basically priced in skewers. The meat is about $ 40-$ 65/skewers. The price in Beitou is not expensive.
We do n’t have porridge and seafood. It ’s very exciting to have 10 oysters in Penghu oysters. Unfortunately, my boyfriend does n’t love, so this time I only burn it.
It is recommended to reservations for small seats. Porridge and seafood climbing are good. Friends who are interested can try it.
It feels pretty good to taste, but unfortunately the sauce is not the taste of my love, and it is lighter (I have a heavy taste), so there is no particularly amazing feeling."
東西都很好吃，蒜味蛤蜊湯真的真的！很！好！喝！ 蒜味很足夠🥹串燒類也好特別，香菇超大朵，很多汁！,"Things are delicious, garlic flavored clam soup is really true!very!good!drink!The garlic flavor is enough to skewers."
"到北投泡溫泉順道吃晚飯，剛好看到這個小店有海鮮粥就碰一下運氣。

點了支豆，牛肉串，鹽蝦，一夜乾跟粥
每個水準都不錯，特別是粥

似乎是用高湯來煮粥，再配上海帶跟貝類。十分出色，強烈建議

…..忘了拍一夜乾的照片🥲","I went to the North Tubo Hot Spring to have dinner along the way, and just when I saw this small shop with seafood porridge, I touched my luck.

Ordered beans, beef skewers, salt shrimp, dry with porridge overnight
Each level is good, especially porridge

It seems to use broth to cook porridge, and then with Shanghai with shells.Very good, strong recommendation

… .. I forgot to take a night of drying 🥲"
這是一間非常有氛圍的居酒屋🏮今天和朋友來慶祝生日，天氣剛好不冷，選了戶外的座位，別有一番風味。跟朋友盡興的小酌，上菜的速度非常的快，先來一碗粥暖暖胃，接著上的肉串的口感也很到味。最期待的是這道烏龍麵果然沒有辜負我的期望。餐點份量價位剛剛好，很適合三兩好友一同享受，而且老闆人很好，謝謝老闆的招待。 …,"This is a very atmospheric izakaya. Today, I came to celebrate the birthday with my friends. The weather was not cold. I chose outdoor seats. Don't have a flavor.With a drink with friends, the speed of serving is very fast. First, a bowl of porridge warms the stomach, and then the taste of the meat skewers is also very delicious.The most anticipated is that this oolong noodle did not disappoint my expectations.The price of the meal is just right, it is very suitable for the three or two friends to enjoy it together, and the boss is very good, thank you for your hospitality.Mowing"
"看到很多人推鮭魚炒飯和烤肉串
就跟朋友一起點來吃，果然很不錯！
已經和他們說好之後聚會都約在這🤩","Seeing many people push salmon fried rice and barbecue skewers

The performance of fried oolong and skewers is also very good, chickens and cows are delicious
The atmosphere is also very good, you must visit again next time ~"
"溫泉配居酒屋非常對味啊，泡溫泉完來一點烤串加啤酒，幸福之至啊❤️

這間居酒屋讓我印象最深刻的就是粥品，粥非常滑順，沒有多餘的配料，卻能嚐出海鮮的鮮美，非常實在，推薦👍。

炸雞軟骨也好吃，炸得脆脆的配上洋蔥與蔥段，下酒的好物啊簡直🥰","The hot spring with the izakaya is very right. After the hot spring, the hot spring comes with a skewers and beer, and the happiness is. ❤️

This izakaya impressed me most is the porridge. The porridge was very smooth. There was no extra ingredients, but I could taste the delicious seafood. It was very real and recommended.

Fried chicken cartilage is also delicious, fried crispy with onion and green onions."
"食材方面是新鮮品質好的，特別是清酒煮蜆，蜆非常飽滿，湯很鮮甜。
服務態度良好，餐廳戶外設計高腳椅可以看欣賞看街景，整體氣氛很棒。","The ingredients are fresh and good, especially the sake boiled crickets.
The service attitude is good. The outdoor design of the restaurant can see the street view. The overall atmosphere is great."
"只有三個字
超級好吃","There are only three words
Super delicious"
"特別的是居酒屋他們有賣粥品，他們的粥是綿密細緻沒有過多的調味，帶點胡椒香及蛤蜊的可口鮮甜！
店面座位不多有分室內及戶外座位，
菜單豐富齊全另除了菜單上的餐點，小黑板上都有每日限定菜單 。","In particular, the izakaya they sell porridge. Their porridge is dense and delicate, without excessive seasoning, with a little pepper fragrance and clam delicious sweetness!
There are not many seats in the store, there are indoor and outdoor seats,
In addition to the meals on the menu, there are daily limited menus on the small blackboard."
"🛂 靠近捷運站，蠻有日式風格店家，座位不算多，擠的程度也蠻日本

東西品項蠻多
🆙 烏龍麵有嚼勁，炒醬口味也很棒，這很可以
🈶炸天婦羅 有魚酥的口感，也蠻特別好吃
🉑雞心 烤醬跟份量來說都蠻好
🈴雞皮 有點焦口配甜甜外衣 也不錯
胡麻山蘇 搭來也蠻爽口開胃

雞肉串 肉是比較乾的那種 口味看人
七里香 跟牛肉 覺得還好
香菇 吃來偏濕軟，口感差了點

整體來說可以吃 ，但外邊用餐的菸味容易飄進來

可吃可再訪但是挑環境的要考慮一下","站 Near the MRT station, there are Japanese -style styles, there are not many seats, and the degree of squeezing is quite Japan.

There are a lot of east -west items
嚼 Oolong noodles are chewy, and the taste of fried sauce is also great.
有 有 🈶 🈶 🈶 has the taste of fish crispy, and it is quite delicious
跟 Chicken heart roasted sauce and portion are pretty good
焦 Chicken skin is a bit burnt with sweet and sweet coats.
Almmama Su is also pretty refreshing and appetizing

Chicken skewers are relatively dry flavors to see people
Qili Xiang and beef think it's okay
The shiitake mushrooms are wet and soft, and the taste is a bit worse

Overall, you can eat it, but the smell of smoke from outside is easy to float in

Can be eaten and visited, but if you pick the environment, you need to consider it"
"這裡的食物很不錯，烤物、炸物等等都很好吃。牛肉、雞肉、豬肉，都很優秀，烤節瓜很好吃。
他的招牌麻辣麵，菜單上寫的好像是嗆麵，忘了，雖然是台式料理，跟店內的日式風格頗不搭調，但是口味奇佳，拌的醬料有紅油炒手的味道，據店家說，是自己煉的花椒油，口味偏麻偏辣，配合其他烤串，有解膩的效果，搭上啤酒，也很對味。
提到啤酒，不得不提醒一下，這裡的啤酒口味偏淡，菜單上說的是麒麟一番搾，但是味道上，比起市售的罐裝麒麟一番搾，明顯口味淡了很多，原因不明。
即使是週間，晚餐時段仍然經常客滿、高朋滿座，商務客、情侶、家庭帶小朋友的客人…什麼人都有。
個人覺得播放的音樂不太適合用餐氛圍，要馳放也不夠輕鬆，要熱鬧也不夠搖滾，在一個很尷尬的邊緣，很突兀的存在著。
最後不得不提一下服務人員，親切度滿分，熱情度零分。送餐、擺盤等等，都是突然冒出來，隨便一放就走人，感覺很奇怪，好像隨便丟在桌角，交代一下這是什麼菜色，就結束工作的感覺，跟在蔦燒用餐的經驗可以說是天差地遠。
總的來說，吃的東西很優秀，酒水很普通，被服務的感受不佳。","The food here is very good, roasted objects, fried objects, etc. are delicious.Beef, chicken, and pork are excellent, and the grilled melon is delicious.
His signature spicy noodles, the menu seems to be stingy, forgot, although it is a tabletop, which is not tone with the Japanese style in the shop, but the taste is good. According to the store, it is my own peppercorns, which is tingling and spicy. With other baking skewers, it has the effect of decomposing greasy. It is also very right to put on beer.
When it comes to beer, I have to remind it that the taste of the beer here is light. The menu is said to be squeezed in Kirin, but in terms of taste, it is much lighter than the available canned Kirin. Essence
Even during the week, the dinner is still full and full of friends, business guests, couples, and family guests with children ... Everyone has it.
Personally, I think that the music played is not suitable for the meal atmosphere, it is not easy to play, and it is not enough to rock. On a very embarrassing edge, it is very abrupt.
In the end, I have to mention the service staff, with a full score and zero enthusiasm.Discords, set plates, etc., all suddenly come out, just leave it, it feels strange, it seems to be thrown on the corner of the table, and explain what the dish it is. The experience of dining can be said to be far away.
In general, the food is very good, the wine is very ordinary, and the service feels poorly."
環境很隨意帶有熱鬧的氛圍，食材新鮮擺盤精緻，提供多樣性飲品及酒種，服務人員非常友善，讓顧客在繁忙的生活步調中能享受片刻的放鬆及享受,"The environment is free to have a lively atmosphere. The ingredients are delicate and exquisite, providing diverse drinks and wine species, and the service staff is very friendly, so that customers can enjoy a moment of relaxation and enjoyment in the busy life pace of life"

這間居酒屋有種獨特的溫馨感，像是隱藏在城市角落的秘密基地。烤串很入味，加上飲料跟氣氛，讓人相當放鬆。,"This izakaya has a unique warmth, like a secret base hidden in the corner of the city.The baking skewers are very delicious, and the drink and the atmosphere are quite relaxed."
"第一次來這邊體驗用餐🍴
餐點部分串燒都很平價也很好吃！CP值超高～另外店內也很有氛圍，適合朋友下班後來小酌一杯🥃","The first time I come here to experience dining 边
The skewers of the meals are very cheap and delicious!The CP value is super high ~ In addition, the store also has an atmosphere, which is suitable for friends to have a drink after get off work."

"非常猛
粥真的頂到不行 牛筋煮也是
一頓吃下來沒有什麼雷的 只有一再驚艷","Very fierce
The porridge is really up to the beef tendon to cook
After eating a meal, there is no thunder."
"二訪這家，餐點等了30分鐘只來五串，比旁邊的客人早一步進場用餐，大概同個時間點送菜單，他們點的炒飯、串燒樣樣來就算了，送來的牛肉雞肉難咬又柴，還有2串鹽烤雞里肌是放涼的，節瓜還給我操灰搭，本來很餓等到後面等飽了，吃了一個多小時95%的時間都在等待餐點，最後因為等太久，主動詢問還有沒有還沒上的餐點，直接跟我說還沒烤。
不會在來訪了，CP值也不高，雷到爆……","In the second visit, I waited for 30 minutes for the meal for 30 minutes. I entered the venue for dining earlier than the guests next to the guests. At the same time, the menu was delivered. The beef chicken is difficult to bite and firewood, and there are 2 string of salt grilled chicken muscles. The melon also gives me ashes. I was hungry and waited until I was full. Waiting for the meal, because I waited too long, I took the initiative to ask if there was still a meal that had not yet been attended, and told me that I hadn't baked.
It will not be visited, the CP value is not high, the thunder is explosive ..."
"東西新鮮好吃，料理手法也很好。上菜速度快，服務人員親切有效率。在非鬧區中有這樣的水準不容易，只有幾點建議，單純從喝一杯的概念分享想法

1. 啤酒杯子有先冰，實屬難得。另外
有試燒酎。建議是用whisky 杯的方式（或加水）
原來的酒壺比較適合清酒的方式。

2. 串燒部分，海鮮類或蔬菜類，可以吃到食材的原味，這個部分很不錯。肉類的部分。鹽烤沒有問題。醬燒醬汁的部分可以考慮味道加重一些，比方肉味比較重的食材或是內臟類的味道加重會比較壓的住。

請繼續加油讓我們在北投有一個可以放鬆喝酒的地方

以上，謝謝招待🙏","The things are fresh and delicious, and the cooking technique is also very good.The speed of serving is fast, and the service staff is intimidated and efficient.There is such a standard in a non -troubled area. There are only a few suggestions.

1. The beer glass is first ice, which is rare.in addition
There is a trial burning.It is recommended to use the WHISky Cup (or add water)
The original jug is more suitable for sake.

2. Stringing parts, seafood or vegetables, you can eat the original flavor of ingredients. This part is very good.The meat part.There is no problem with salt roasting.The part of the sauce sauce can be considered to increase the taste. For example, the ingredients with heavier meat or internal organs will increase.

Please continue to cheer, let us have a place where you can relax and drink in Beitou

The above, thank you for the entertainment 招"
"CP值蠻高的店，大概人均400可以吃的很飽
因為Covid-19疫情只能外帶不能內用。
串燒類分雞牛豬等各大類，烤工都不錯而且雞跟豬都蠻嫩的，大概一串都40-50元這種銅板價
炒烏龍麵跟嗆辣麵也很好吃
炸甜不辣蠻下酒的
會想讓人再來一次的地方","The cp value is quite high, about 400 per capita, you can eat very full
Because the COVID-19 epidemic can only be taken out and cannot be used.
The skewers are divided into major categories such as chickens, cattle, pork, etc. The roasted workers are good and the chickens and pigs are quite tender. About a string is 40-50 yuan.
Frying Oolong noodles and spicy noodles are also delicious
Sweet sweet and spicy is very wine
I want to make people come again"
"服務好，上菜速度快，但食物不如預期的高分😅
表現最好的是
松阪炒水蓮，水蓮的嫩度剛剛好！
椒麻脆皮豆腐，椒麻醬非常香又夠味，豆腐外脆內軟，推！
乾拌麵，台式口味，自製醬料配上細麵，每一口都吃得到醬香，很涮嘴。

其他品項較為普通不到驚豔...尤其
明太子雞腿灑了海苔粉明顯不搭，海苔粉搶走明太子的鹹香感。
脆皮糖霜松阪豬，吃得出表皮甜味卻沒有脆皮感，上菜時溫度不夠熱。
蔬菜、肉串類比較適合鹽烤，醬烤的醬料偏淡卻又無法提升食物美味😅 其中櫛瓜是最不搭的...","The service is good, the food is fast, but the food is not as high as expected.
The best performance is
Matsusaka fried water lotus, the tenderness of water lotus is just right!
Beckles' crispy skin tofu, pepper sauce is very fragrant and flavorful, the tofu is crispy and soft inside, push!
Dry noodles, desktop flavors, homemade sauce with fine noodles, every bite can be eaten with sauce, pouting.

Other items are relatively common to be amazing ... especially
The Chicken legs of the Ming Dynasty were clearly not paired with seaweed flour, and the seaweed flour snatched the salty sense of the prince.
Crispy skin frosting Matsusaka pigs can eat the sweetness of the epidermal but there is no crispy skin, and the temperature is not hot enough when serving.
Vegetables and skewers are more suitable for salt roasted. The sauce sauce is light but cannot improve the delicious food. Among them, the gourd is the least ..."

服務親切、食物好吃、價格CP值高、不貴(結帳時還以為老闆少算了)，值得推薦，交通方便，在北投捷運站旁。ㄧ定要訂位。明太子炒烏龍麵、薑絲蛤蠣湯、起司雞腿...推薦！,"The service is cordial, the food is delicious, the price of the price is high, and it is not expensive (I think the boss is less calculated at the checkout). It is worth recommending and convenient for transportation.ㄧ Definitely set.The prince of the Ming Dynasty fried oolong noodles, ginger clam soup, cheese chicken leg ... Recommended!"
大推松阪水蓮，好好吃喔～肉的味道很夠！吃起來有口感但不會咬不爛，甜點的麻吉也不會膩。,"Push Songsaka Shuilian, it's delicious ~ The taste of meat is enough!It tastes tasteless but does not bite, and the dessert Muji will not be greasy."
東西很好吃🤩是很適合跟朋友聚餐的居酒屋，喝酒小酌再配一點下酒菜，就可以聊到天長地久～ …,"The things are delicious. 🤩 酒 is a izakaya that is very suitable for meals with friends. If you drink a little bit of wine and drink, you can talk about the long time ~ ..."

朋友介紹特地來嚐嚐看～想不到讓我驚艷了一下～居酒屋居然有賣粥耶～而且還蠻好吃的～另外點了燒烤跟嗆麵也都覺得很美味～美中不足的地方就是上菜久了一點～可能是生意太好了～哈,"Friends introduced it for special taste ~ I never thought it made me amazing ~ Izakaya actually sells porridge ~ and it is quite delicious ~ In addition, you can also feel delicious when you order barbecue and noodles. One point ~ It may be that the business is great ~ ha ha"
來了第二次實在很不想分享啊～如果越來越多人知道，我吃不到了怎麼辦～喜歡店裡放鬆的氛圍，喜歡山葵雞腿皮脆多汁、雞皮還有麻糬😋嗆麵也是很不錯的選擇，吃得飽又滿足！哥吉拉加分❤️ …,"I really do n’t want to share it for the second time ~ If more and more people know, what should I do if I ca n’t eat it ~ I like the relaxed atmosphere in the store, I like the cocks and juicy of the sunflower chicken legs, chicken skin and hemp noodles are also very Good choice, full and satisfied!Gejerag score ❤️ ..."

✨飲料點冬瓜拿鐵：說不上來的味道，跟平常想像的不一樣，應該不只加鮮奶，很特別的好好喝。
冬瓜檸檬，很像十二鍋檸檬冬瓜冰沙，沒有冰沙的味道。","The skewers are roasted very well, without any thunder.
Clam porridge is a bit lighter, but it is still delicious, and it is cooked like a very smooth taste of Hong Kong -style porridge.
Fried fried fried fried objects is very important. It must be clicked.
The dry noodles are also delicious, and the saltiness is enough. It is similar to the XO sauce, which is very fragrant.

瓜 Drink to order winter melon latte: The taste that can't be said is different from the usual imagination. It should not only add fresh milk, it is very special.
Winter melon lemon is very similar to the twelve pot lemon winter melon smoothie, without the taste of smoothie."
"東西好吃價格也便宜，但店員的服務態度還有待加強，居酒屋品項很多給菜單時可以簡單做點介紹（店內招牌料理,推薦等等），從點菜時沒有跟我們重複確認餐點，導致當天餐點有所遺漏，送餐時也沒有告知送來的是什麼，幾乎都是餐點丟了就走。","The good price of things is also cheap, but the service attitude of the clerk needs to be strengthened. When a lot of Izakaya items are given to the menu, you can simply introduce some introduction (in -store signature dishes, recommendations, etc.). As a result, the meal was omitted on the day, and I didn't tell what it was delivered at the time of delivery. Almost all meals were lost and left."
很讚的一間店 每次去北投跑完溫泉一定會去造訪一次 烤串很美味 讓人想一口接一口,A very good shop will visit the hot spring every time you go to Beitou and run the hot spring. It will definitely visit the skewers. It is delicious.

其中炒烏龍麵與海鮮粥很喜歡，味道很棒
烤牡蠣聽說都是澎湖直送，烤起來特別鮮美多汁

唯一美中不足就是位子比較少，想去的話記得打電話預約","Izakaya hidden in the alley
Most of the clerks are young, and they pay attention to the taste of the meal that is suitable for guests
Among them, fried oolong noodles and seafood porridge like it, and the taste is great

"雖然不是第一次吃了，卻已成為想念的味道了。
這邊的餐點很豐富，串烤類是一串一串點，很貼心！非常為一位用餐的客人著想。
如果很喜歡就多點幾串也可以！
雞皮炸的酥脆，醬料調整也很誘人！尤其是粥品更是厲害，不會像外面的湯泡飯一樣，是貨真價實的粥品
偶爾小酌一番，鄰近北投捷運站非常的方便！
員工們也對客戶很親切，也很會聊天，跟客人的距離拿捏得當，很喜歡這邊的氛圍，希望大家之後也喜歡這邊！非常推薦給各路來北投的客人！東西也很不錯也很舒服，來這邊的人一定要嚐過粥品，喝一杯啤酒搭配幾串串燒，炒個青菜，舒舒服服的回家","Although it is not the first time, it has become a taste of miss.

第一次到訪，整體口味都不錯，座位空間較小，價格較去年網路上文章價格漲了不少，這次消費兩個人1400左右。,"For the first time, the overall taste was good, the seat space was small, and the price increased a lot from the price of articles on the Internet last year. This time, it consumed about 1,400 people."
特別的是居酒屋他們有賣粥品，適合冬天用餐，菜單非常豐富，冷物、吸物、炒食、甜點、串燒、炊粥應有盡有，適合推薦給家庭小酌,"In particular, izakaya they have porridge, which is suitable for winter meals. The menu is very rich. Cold, sucking, fried food, desserts, skewers, skewers, and cooking porridge should be available."

東西還不錯吃，品項也蠻多，算是會回訪的名單之一，三不五時就會約朋友來吃飯聊天。,"Things are not bad, and there are quite a lot of items. It is one of the lists that will be returned. I will ask friends to come and chat with friends from three or five."
在北投的其中一個晚上，路過來吃吃看，意外的發現非常好吃😋，推薦串燒跟烏龍麵。,"One night in Beitou, I came over to eat, and the unexpected discovery was very delicious. It is recommended to skeve and oolong noodles."

美好的食物請耐心等待😋 …","The two brothers of the boss are strictly selected fresh ingredients every day.

The signature boss loves noodles very well, and the portion is too small ~
There are a lot of Oolong noodles, and the taste is okay."
"是每個月犒賞自己的好地方，
極度推薦豬肝及手羽先，
師傅把這兩項食材提升到另一個境界；
其他品項的發揮也是十分優秀，店內黑板有時候會有特殊食材，可以去嘗試嘗試別的地方吃不到的食物。

Note：人多記得先定位，除非你跟我一樣都一個人。

消費次數：我基本上每個月都去一次，數不清了，餐點沒讓我失望過。","It's a good place to reward yourself every month,
Extremely recommended pork liver and hand feathers first,
The master raises these two ingredients to another realm;
The performance of other items is also very excellent. Sometimes there are special ingredients in the blackboard in the store, and you can try to try food that you can't eat other places.

Note: Remember to locate a lot, unless you are alone like me.

Consumption: I basically go once a month, and I can't count it. The meal has not disappointed me."

After a long time after a long time, I found that the meal was slower, and the meal portion was significantly less. I hope I can reply to the level just opened before"

小資嗆麵超過分，讓人一口接一口，完全停不下來。
點了牛肉、豬肉、起司雞肉串，每種肉都鮮嫩多汁，有夠美味。
只可惜當天無法小酌一杯，含恨啊⋯
有機會絕對再訪！","The chicken skin personally feels that it is a bit dry, a little less oil, and the taste is very crispy, but it is dry
The petty bourgeoisie has more than the score, which makes people take a bite and can't stop at all.
Ordered beef, pork, cheese chicken skewers, each kind of meat is tender and juicy, which is delicious enough.
It's a pity that I can't have a drink that day, hate ...
Have a chance to visit again!"
