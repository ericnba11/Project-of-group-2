超好的⋯⋯台北目前去過最喜歡的咖૮⸝⸝ᴗ͈ ‸ ᴗ͈⸝⸝ა

蘋果肉桂溫蛋糕超級好吃⋯⋯ㅠㅠ
蛋糕外層脆脆的 有點像費南雪那樣的脆皮 帶點硬度 叉子要費一些力才能切下去
糕體的肉桂香氣滿明顯的 有蘋果塊的地方會有那種果香跟（一點點）果酸的風味 很提升層次
重點是白色的醬 配得超好⋯⋯！因為蛋糕單吃稍顯無趣 而且會有些乾 配這種潤潤的醬很好⋯⋯醬味道有點奶 鹹鹹的 然後整體有點像優格（？）味道有點優格 口感跟稠度也很像 我覺得很搭 好好吃😭⋯⋯而且剛端上來吃的話 醬是冰的蛋糕是溫熱的 溫度的層次也很好⋯⋯！
上面還有撒堅果碎！也很配 突然咬到會添增了一個堅果香氣
我覺得整體的組合設計 無論是風味、口感還是溫度 都超級配⋯⋯哈啊啊啊很喜歡ㅠㅠ

拿鐵也很好喝！！咖啡跟牛奶的比例很剛好 是咖啡比較重一點的那種 但喝起來很舒服⋯⋯！超級順 喜歡 整杯喝完都不會有不適ㄉ感覺
而且這個拿鐵的豆子香氣好好喔⋯⋯很喜歡這個風味！感覺是中深焙那邊的嗎 入口有很濃厚的香氣 尾韻帶一點點酸感 主要是這支豆子香氣真的很好⋯⋯好喜歡ㅠㅠ救命

喔而且溫蛋糕跟拿鐵超級無敵搭
溫蛋糕吃太多會有點甜膩 這時候就可以喝一口香氣很濃醇很馥郁的拿 然後就可以繼續快樂吃蛋糕～～👄🍰😋😭🤤😁😍🙂‍↕️🤓👆🏻～～～
完美組合 給一百顆星、、、

然後然後然後 老闆人超級好的⋯⋯！我覺得服務很貼心而且很有溫度⋯⋯ 有一個點超可愛的 好像客人走了之後 老闆都會自己實際去坐那個椅子然後調整桌椅角度什麼的 超好笑很可愛 第一次看到這樣的
也很用心在觀察客人（可能會需要的）需求 像是會搬凳子讓客人放包包 還有我在讀文本老闆經過看到就拿了一個燈給我 說給你一個閱讀燈好不好（還什麼的） 然後幫我把它打開點了兩段變比較亮 服務真的很好很好ㅠㅠ⋯⋯

去的時候很想吃肉桂捲但賣完了 結果老闆送了半個肉桂捲給我⋯⋯（就是長得沒那麼好看所以沒賣的）但很好啊真的很好 除了很好還是很好 超級無敵開心ㅠㅠ！謝謝老闆ㅠㅠ！！","＊拿鐵咖啡 $𝟭𝟯𝟱

"總評：🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑
價格： 250$ 💰

那這一間咖啡廳走得比較像是老宅的文青風！

如果有特別喜歡這類咖啡廳風格的朋友們
絕對走過路過不能夠錯過啊！
不過因為店內的空間真的是不算大
所以座位數也沒有這麼多

那因為店內有非常多的部分算是老宅翻新的感覺
所以走進來有非常多可以拍照的地方～
因此除了基本的咖啡廳以外
各種老宅的景點以及佈置也算是一大賣點吧！

就像是如圖片中所看到的
可以看到非常有創意的吸煙區
裡面也是擺了各種畫作以及佈置～
因此在這邊也會有相當多的消費遊客們在這邊拍照～

那店內的氣氛也是蠻寧靜安和的
在炎炎夏日的午後
很適合來這邊吹吹冷氣喝喝咖啡吃甜點～

那店內所賣的甜點種類也是不少
可能需要當天來看現場有什麼甜點可以販賣！

食物：🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑
酒飲：🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑
氣氛：🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑
服務：🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑
價格：🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑
位置：🌕🌕🌖🌑🌑

⭐️ 食物部分
那當天點了一個小蛋糕來吃
基本上這邊的甜點我個人覺得味道還不錯
雖然不到令人非常驚艷
但是搭配著茶飲也是很夠了！

吃著甜甜的蛋糕配上好喝的茶飲～
在這裡確實也是一大享受呢！

⭐️酒飲部分
👉棉花糖鮮乳厚奶茶
基本上這邊的奶茶也是如同一般的奶茶差不多
那配上了棉花糖的名義
是一個比較有特色的飲品

那從途中也可以看到基本上就是原本的奶茶上面放了棉花糖做特別的裝飾
那當然上面的棉花糖也是可以享用的
所以就是奶茶配上棉花糖的感覺

棉花糖本身就是個小小的糖果
那一樣你可以把它丟進奶茶裡面做配合去喝
算是一個蠻有創意的飲品

那基本的奶茶部分就如同一般的奶茶這樣子！
我覺得在這杯飲品上面應該算是創意大於風味吧🤣🤣🤣

⭐️氣氛部分
前面有提到說這邊的咖啡廳
整體而言比較像是老宅咖啡廳的感覺
從外觀就可以看到非常的簡樸以及年代感
但是走進室內之後就會發現也是比較現代的感覺

那當然這棟建築有部分還是老宅的感覺
像是包含說廁所以及吸煙區
都還是維持著偏向老宅的感覺

因此在這部分的裝潢以及設計也是非常的有年代感
因此也吸引了非常多的客人來這邊拍照

那如果是喜歡這種老宅咖啡廳的朋友們
我相信會非常喜愛這裡吧！

那店內的座位數也不算太多
因此有時候還是需要稍微等待一些時間才可以進入～

整理的氣氛也算是安靜
很適合跟朋友兩三個前來這邊喝喝下午茶吃吃甜點
享受老宅咖啡廳的氣氛

⭐️服務部分
那基本上印象中當天沒有什麼特別的服務
就是非常基本的點餐送餐這個部分～

⭐️價格部分
那基本上以台北的咖啡廳來講
這邊算是正常價偏低一點點
可能是因為不算是在市中心的地方吧
因此來這邊點杯飲料點個甜點
度過一個下午算是C P值蠻高的！

⭐️位置部分
因為這一間咖啡廳算是在木柵
那一般的大眾運輸交通工具，基本上只有公車可以抵達
所以在交通方面可能並不是這麼的優秀
而且附近的位置也沒有什麼其他可以配合前往的部分

因此可能為了這間咖啡廳得特地來前往吧～
因此位置部分可能就要斟酌一下怎麼樣安排行程囉！

⭐️整體而言
我覺得算是在木柵一間不錯的咖啡廳
那包含著他的氣氛以及老宅的感覺都非常的棒
店內的飲品以及甜點也都還算是水準

因此我覺得如果是路過木柵或者是對於老家咖啡廳或這間店有特別興趣的朋友們
都非常歡迎特地前來
那當然因為店內的位子數不多

可能得事先先詢問～或者是現場排隊才行

🤪狄克森嘴炮區🤪
哎呀，說到木柵
我想大家的口袋名單應該都不多吧？

因此，如果你帶著妹子來到木柵玩的話（？
首先可能第一個想到的就是動物園
那你去完動物園大概就下午了

因此在木柵要怎麼樣轉場前往下一個約會地點呢？
我想這一間咖啡廳應該就會是你的好選擇吧！

如果妹子剛好是很喜愛這種老宅咖啡廳的感覺
那我想就是中了！

妹子可能會稱讚你是多麼的有眼光
看看這咖啡廳帶著老宅的氣息
看看這每一個角落以及牆壁還有門都是有歷史的感覺
似乎整間店都在跟你訴說著他的過去

哇
這時候跟妹子好好聊聊這些東西
這下你們的距離是不是有拉近了呢？","General Comment: 🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑
Price: 250 $ 0

Then this cafe is more like Wen Qingfeng of the old house!

If you have friends who especially like this type of cafe style
I can't miss it by passing by!
But because the space in the store is really not big
So there are not so many seats

Because there are many parts in the store, it feels like the old house is renovated
So there are a lot of places where you can take pictures ~
So except for basic cafes
The attractions and layouts of various old houses are also a big selling point!

It's like you can see in the picture
You can see a very creative smoking area
There are various paintings and arrangements in it ~
Therefore, there will be quite a lot of consumer tourists here to take pictures here ~

The atmosphere in that shop is also quite peaceful and peaceful
In the afternoon of the hot summer
It is very suitable to come here to blow air -conditioned coffee to eat dessert ~

There are many types of desserts sold in the store
It may be necessary to see what desserts can be sold on the same day!

Food: 🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑
Jiu drink: 🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑
Atmosphere: 🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑
Service: 🌕🌕🌕🌘🌑
Price: 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑
Position: 🌕🌕🌖🌑🌑

⭐️ Food part
I ordered a small cake to eat that day that day
Basically, the dessert here I personally think the taste is pretty good
Although it is not very amazing
But it is enough to match tea!

Eat sweet cakes with delicious tea ~
It's really a great enjoyment here!

⭐️ ⭐ 饮 part
鲜 Marshmallow fresh milk thick milk tea
Basically, the milk tea here is just like ordinary milk tea
It is matched with the name of marshmallow
It is a more distinctive drink

From the way, you can also see that basically the original milk tea is placed on the marshmallow for special decoration
Of course, the marshmallow above can also be enjoyed
So the feeling of milk tea with marshmallow

Marshmallow itself is a small candy
Then you can throw it into the milk tea to cooperate with it to drink
It is a pretty creative drink

The basic milk tea part is like a normal milk tea!
I think it should be considered as creative than flavor in this cup of drinks 🤣🤣🤣

⭐️ The atmosphere part
As mentioned earlier, the coffee shop here
Overall looks like the feeling of old house cafes
From the appearance, you can see very simple and the sense of age
But after entering the room, you will find that it is also more modern.

Of course, some of this building still feels like the old house
Like containing toilet and smoking area
They still maintain the feeling of being biased towards the old house

Therefore, the decoration and design in this part are also very old -fashioned
So it also attracted a lot of guests to come here to take pictures

If you are a friend who likes this kind of old house cafe
I believe it will love here very much!

The number of seats in that shop is not too much
So sometimes you still need to wait a little time to enter ~

The atmosphere of sorting is also quiet
It's very suitable for two or three friends to come here to drink afternoon tea to eat desserts
Enjoy the atmosphere of the old house cafe

⭐️ Service part
Basically, there is no special service that day in the impression that day
It's a very basic order to order meals ~

⭐️ The price part
Basically, in Taipei's cafe
This is a little lower at normal price
Maybe it's because it is not in the city center, right?
So come here to order a drink and drink a dessert
After a afternoon, the C p value is quite high!

⭐️ location part
Because this cafe is considered in Muzha
Then the general public transport transportation, basically only the bus can arrive
Therefore, transportation may not be so excellent in terms of transportation
And there is no other location nearby.

So you may come and go for this cafe ~
Therefore, the location part may be considered how to arrange the itinerary!

言️ Overall
I think it is a good coffee shop in Muzha
It contains his atmosphere and the feeling of the old house is great
The drinks and desserts in the store are still standard

So I think if you are passing by Muzha or a friend who has a special interest in his hometown or this store
They are very welcome to come here
Of course, because there are not many seats in the store

Maybe you may ask in advance ~ or line up on the spot

炮 Dixon mouth cannon area 🤪
Oh, when it comes to Muzha
I think there are not many pocket lists, right?

So if you bring your sister to Muzha to play (?
The first thing that may be the first to think of is the zoo
Then you go to the zoo for about afternoon

So how should I transfer to the next date in Muzha?
I think this cafe should be your good choice!

If the girl just likes the feeling of this old house cafe
Then I think it's hit!

The girl may like to praise you how visual you are
Look at the breath of this cafe with the old house
Look at every corner of this, and the walls, and the door, and the door is a historical feeling
It seems that the whole store is telling you about his past

Wow
Talk to the girl at this time and talk about these things
Is your distance closer now?"
"☕️木柵、政大附近（要過橋）的一家老屋咖啡廳。

✅平日不限時！
⚠️假日「客滿」限時兩小。
🛜有Wi-Fi。
🔌多數座位有插座。
💰目前可支付方式：現金、轉帳。
✅有開立電子發票。
🍹有賣酒。
🕛營業到午夜。
🚬有吸煙區。

環境十分舒服的一家咖啡廳，應該是傳統老屋改建的，不過是舒服寬敞的那種老屋，採用尖頂屋頂所以內部空間很高，而且不只一棟建築物，正門口有一塊庭院空地，往廁所走去還有一間矮房，裡面放了煙灰缸，因此應該是吸菸區吧！戶外區濃濃的蚊香味，店內也備有防蚊精油，畢竟靠溪邊，可能夏天時戶外會有蚊蟲肆虐。
店內座位數不少，而且間隔也很夠，並不會很擁擠的感覺。店門口招牌有寫「movie」、店內也有一台投影機，或許有時候會放電影吧！

這次點「棉花糖鮮乳厚奶茶」和「經典紅絲絨蛋糕」，棉花糖奶茶很特別，上面還放了淋上焦糖醬的烤棉花糖，只是有一點兒過甜就是了，但還是算好喝的。甜點的紅絲絨蛋糕反而還沒有鮮奶茶甜，紅絲絨蛋糕口感很不錯。

當作唸書工作或聊天的咖啡廳都可以，不過畢竟沒有限制音量、而且有售酒，可能不會很安靜就是了！","附️ An old house cafe in Muzha and Zhengda (to cross the bridge).

🚬 There is a smoking area.

A coffee shop with a very comfortable environment should be rebuilt by traditional old houses, but it is a comfortable and spacious old house. The internal space of the scoop roof is very high, and there is a building in the front door. There is still a dwarf house in the toilet with ashtray in it, so it should be a smoking area!The strong mosquito coils in the outdoor area are also equipped with anti -mosquito essential oils in the store. After all, it is on the side of the stream. There may be mosquito raging outdoors in summer.
There are a lot of seats in the store, and the interval is enough, and it will not feel crowded.There are ""Movie"" in front of the store's entrance, and there is also a projector in the store. Maybe sometimes it will put movies!

This time, ""Marshmallow Fresh milk thick milk tea"" and ""classic red velvet cake"", marshmallow milk tea is very special, and roasted marshmallow with caramel sauce is also placed on it. It's delicious.The red velvet cake of the dessert has no sweet milk tea, and the red velvet cake tastes very good.

It can be used as a coffee shop for studying or chatting, but after all, there is no restriction of volume and selling wine, it may not be quiet!"
這是一家非常有韻味的老宅咖啡廳，店家採自助服務，水和衛生紙需自取，故沒有一成服務費，低消是一杯飲品，只收現金，人多的時候，有2小時的用餐限制。最推「棉花糖鮮乳厚奶茶」選用來自台灣牧場牛奶，濃郁的奶香味真的很迷人，讓人有滿滿的幸福感。最愛「黑糖拿鐵」黑糖是店家自己烹煮而成，調和香濃的奶香及咖啡香，更具有特殊的風味。「可可歐蕾」的質地表現的很優，綿密細緻滑順，值得嘗試看看。「焦糖蘋果溫蛋糕」，外皮呈現微焦，香濃的焦糖香，外脆內軟的口感好吃。「布朗尼冰淇淋」放置在碗紙上，醬汁配料的點綴，很有質感美味好吃。在這種懷舊古厝品嚐咖啡，別有一番風味。,"This is a very charming old house cafe.

「自由·之丘」位在文山區木新路的巷子裡，彷彿走進鄉村農作的古厝，屋前還真有小廣場，似乎昔日在曬穀的地方，真的還蠻有韻味的。在這種懷舊氛圍古厝喝咖啡，特別有種不同的感受。店家採自助服務，水和衛生紙需自取，室內裝潢就原有古厝中樑的結構，恢復到復古的場景，環境卻非常典雅，座位舒適潔淨，較暗燈光讓氣氛顯得更寧謐。服務人員都會一桌一盤堅果，感覺很不錯，最愛的是「棉花糖鮮乳厚奶茶」，店家選用台灣牧場牛奶，香醇的奶味好喝，濃郁的奶香也太誘人了。「黑糖拿鐵」似乎是店家自己烹調的黑糖，搭在香濃的奶香咖啡香，更有特殊的風味。「布朗尼冰淇淋」及「焦糖蘋果溫蛋糕」，口感雖有不同，放置在碗紙上，各搭著配料點綴，顯得很有質感且好吃。其他品項的咖啡也很好喝，來到木柵想找一間懷舊的咖啡店，能夠追憶往日情懷的風情，親朋好友聚會的場所，「自由·之丘」或許是一個你值得考慮的好去處。,"""Freedom · Hill"" is located in the alley of Muxin Road in Wenshan District, as if walking into the ancient puppet of rural farmers.

"很文青感的咖啡呢，

It is quite inconvenient to park

"✨推薦蘋果肉桂溫蛋糕✨

甜點⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
這裡有比較少見的紅絲絨蛋糕、肉桂溫蛋糕。
紅絲絨內夾的鹹乳酪非常好吃，蛋糕體很紮實，鮮奶油非常綿密濃郁。
另外一定要點溫蛋糕，外脆內軟，外皮微焦糖化超級香，內餡的肉桂蘋果畫龍點睛搭上鹹香奶油真的好好吃！會想要回訪！

環境⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
老屋改造，氣氛很好，建築很有特色，待在這裡感覺換了時空環境很舒服。","✨推薦蘋果肉桂溫蛋糕✨

"看表演才到訪。環境很復古舒適！
點了水果茶，內有大量蘋果丁、橘子和檸檬，滿好喝的","Watch the performance before visiting.The environment is very retro and comfortable!
Ordered fruit tea, there are a lot of apple diced, oranges and lemon inside, full of delicious"
很有韻味的老宅咖啡廳，販售有咖啡、茶、當日甜點、酒精飲料等，低消為一杯飲品，假日限時2小時，若沒有客滿則不會趕人；當天點的黑糖咖啡很喜歡，黑糖是店家自煮的很不錯，巴斯克乳酪蛋糕也相當美味，綿密滑順的乳酪上灑上肉鬆，鹹甜鹹甜的滋味真是令人意猶未盡！店內的光線偏昏暗，播放的音樂蠻好聽的，挺適合三五好友聊天放鬆，不過就不太適合工作或閱讀了，整體來說「自由．之丘」的飲品、甜點和chill chill的氛圍，我都很喜歡！,"Very charm old house cafe, which sells coffee, tea, desserts, alcoholic beverages, etc. It is a cup of drink. It is limited to 2 hours on holidays. Like it, brown sugar is very good to cook by the store. Basque cheese cake is also quite delicious. The dense and smooth cheese is sprinkled with meat pine. The salty and sweet taste is really endless!The light in the store is dim, and the music played is pretty good. It is very suitable for three or five friends to chat and relax, but it is not suitable for work or reading. On the whole I like it very much!"
"寵物友善❤️今天人好多，預約稍等一會，店家帶我們到庭院有間小房間，是塔羅牌老師的專屬空間，剛好塞的下三個女生和一隻男生。
等半小時後陸續上了我們點的黑糖厚奶茶，貝里詩奶酒拿鐵，水果茶，飲料水準很棒！每杯飲料都在外觀溫度上有讓我們感到開心！
下次有機會再來！","Pets are friendly ❤️ There are a lot of people today. I will make an appointment for a while. The store takes us to a small room in the courtyard. It is the exclusive space of the Tarot teacher.
After half an hour, we put on the brown sugar thick milk tea, Bayi Poetry Milk Wine Latie, Fruit Tea, and the drinking level is great!Every cup of drinks make us happy in appearance temperature!
I will come again next time!"

"搬家之後第一次來，之前會來這間咖啡廳的時候都還沒開始寫評論呢！真懷念！
平常都愛喝咖啡，這次想來點特別的就喝了水果茶，我跟大家說，這杯真的你會覺得「我的世界充滿了水果」，水果真的是滿滿的欸！吼吼，真的疲憊的一天都被水果治癒了。（水果茶偏酸）
然後紅絲絨蛋糕應該有因應台灣人調過口味，不會甜到不行，我很喜歡，鮮奶油也很特別，但不知道加了什麼，總之喜歡！朋友也喜歡他的棉花糖甜甜飲料。
搬家之後，覺得風格還是沒有變，一樣是那種很接地氣的溫暖，覺得只要人生不如意了些，來這裡就能得到一些治癒，總之來到這邊心情真的很放鬆，而且裝水去我第一次看到有冷熱水的哈哈哈哈，超貼心🥺
然後，老闆、店員，依然親切也把你當成家人的感覺，舒服的對話交流，總之快樂。

就不評分了，直封木柵第一名咖啡廳。","For the first time after moving, I haven't started writing comments when I came to this cafe before!I really miss!
I usually like to drink coffee. This time I want to drink fruit tea. I told you that you really feel that ""my world is full of fruit"", and the fruit is really full!Roar, it was really tired for a day.(Fruit tea is acidic)
Then the red velvet cake should have the taste in response to the taste of the Taiwanese. It will not be sweet. I like it very much. The fresh cream is very special, but I do n’t know what to add. In short, I like it!Friends also like sweet drinks of marshmallow.
After moving, I feel that the style still has not changed. It is the same warmth of the ground. I feel that as long as life is not satisfactory, you can get some healing here. In short The first time I saw hot and cold water hahahaha, super intimate 🥺
Then, the boss and the clerk still treat you as the feeling of your family, a comfortable conversation and exchange, in short, happy.

There is no scoring, the first coffee shop in the straight wooden gate."
"一進店裡看到櫃檯，想說內用位置應該不大，結果走進去簡直魔術大空間，環境跟氛圍相當舒適，播放著日文歌曲，整個好chill 。
從來沒吃過紅絲絨蛋糕，第一次品嚐覺得是很棒的初體驗，巧克力不會過餘甜膩，搭配一旁的鮮奶油真的好好吃。
店員人都很nice ，低消一杯飲品，假日客滿限時2小，沒客滿都不會趕人，整體而言是非常推薦的咖啡廳！","When I entered the store to see the counter, I wanted to say that the inner position should not be large. As a result, I walked into the magic space. The environment and the atmosphere were quite comfortable. They played Japanese songs, and the whole Chill was good.
I have never eaten red velvet cakes. The first taste is a great first experience. The chocolate will not be too sweet, and the fresh cream on the side is really delicious.
The clerk is very nice. A low -disappearance of drinks. Holiday passengers are full of 2 small, and they will not catch people without full. Overall, it is a very recommended cafe!"
木柵鐵觀音好喝，但備料好像備很少，紅絲絨蛋糕沒了想外帶一杯鐵觀音也沒了🥲,"Muzha Tieguanyin is delicious, but the preparation seems to be rarely prepared. The red velvet cake is gone."
"環境不如預期
拿鐵跟鮮奶茶口味一般

氣氛跟服務態度良好","The environment is not as good as expected
Latte and fresh milk tea taste average

The atmosphere and service attitude are good"
"看到摩托車友到訪此處，所以過來看看喝杯咖啡。整間店非常的有特色彷彿在喧囂的城市中找到了一絲平靜。
檸檬咖啡也是挺好喝的，稍微甜了點，可以接受範圍。
紅絲絨蛋糕非常的好吃，糕體非常的紮實。

門口可以停摩托車或重機。
老闆及店員都非常友善的介紹。","Seeing that motorcycle friends visited here, so come to see a cup of coffee.The whole store is very distinctive as if a trace of peace in the hustle and bustle city.
Lemon coffee is also very delicious, a little sweet, and can accept the range.
The red velvet cake is very delicious and the cake body is very solid.

"🍋檸檬咖啡 有人說太甜 但吃不了苦的我覺得完全不會 頂多微甜
🍰紅絲絨蛋糕 中間好像是酸乳酪（？ 紮實的口感 蠻甜的","有 Lemon coffee some people say that it is too sweet but I can't eat bitterness. I don't think it will be slightly slightly sweet at all.
The middle of the red velvet cake seems to be sour cheese (? The solid taste is quite sweet"
可以用電腦辦公，肉桂捲好吃，榛果咖啡也很好喝，還有吸菸室超棒的,"You can use your computer to work, cinnamon rolls are delicious, hazelnut coffee is also delicious, and the smoking room is superb"
這陣子迷上他們的生啤酒（店內其他精釀也不錯），很香很好喝，還有附一小碟綜合堅果解嘴饞很快樂，煩躁的時候來這裡邊喝邊工作太幸福了,"This time I was obsessed with their raw beer (the other crafts in the store were also good), very fragrant and delicious, and a small disc comprehensive nuts were very happy. When I was irritable"

"隱身在巷弄裡的咖啡廳，有兩條小巷子可以進入，到咖啡廳時感到很驚奇，戶外場地空間很大。
下午三點到室內沒有位置，坐在戶外木台區也很愜意，店家有備蚊香、防蚊液，可供顧客使用。

5/29三點到時候的甜點有「鐵觀音重乳酪跟布朗尼冰淇淋」（其餘賣完）

鐵觀音重乳酪$180 ：鐵觀音茶香配合原本的乳酪非常好吃，上面的鮮奶油很清爽不油膩感，吃了不用擔心有罪惡感，下面的餅乾好像有加入脆堅果，口感很特別！

布朗尼冰淇淋$180 ：製作時間較久，因布朗尼要烤，微熱的布朗尼配上香草冰淇淋真的超級好吃！同時吃到巧克力跟香草的香氣。

飲料點「自由之丘水果茶、棉花糖鮮乳厚奶茶」
自由之丘水果茶 冰 $150 ：必點茶點！上面滿滿的水果粒（蘋果、奇異果、柳丁）可以先吃掉，不然會掉到滿地都是，材料豐富，水果茶酸甜好喝。

棉花糖鮮乳厚奶茶 冰 $150 ：上面加棉花糖搭配奶茶還不錯，但有可能是鮮奶綜合掉紅茶，沒有到很甜的感覺，可以先跟店員講希望製作甜一點。

待一整個下午很幸運沒下午後雷陣雨，只有幾滴的太陽雨哈哈哈，當天風也不大，很適合跟朋友聊天放鬆。抬頭可以看到高樓大廈與自由之丘呈現極大反差，想要在都市裡尋找鄉村、懷舊、放鬆很適合去看看。

有提供：
戶外吸菸區
廁所
WiFi
行充
蚊香、防蚊液
Uber eat

店家：
店員熱情親切服務很好
有備蚊香超讚
餐點也非常好吃

如有需坐輪椅之顧客請在木柵路三段103巷進去，另一條導航的路線非常窄","There are two alleys that can be entered in the cafe hidden in the alley. I was surprised when I arrived at the cafe. The space outdoor venue was very large.
There is no location indoors at three o'clock in the afternoon, and it is also very pleasant to sit in the outdoor wooden area. The store has mosquito coils and anti -mosquito liquids for customers to use.

5/29 The desserts from three o'clock are ""Tieguanyin Heavy Cheese and Brown Ice Cream"" (the rest is sold out)

Tieguanyin heavy cheese $ 180: Tieguanyin tea fragrance is very delicious with the original cheese. The fresh cream on it is very refreshing and not greasy. Do n’t worry about sinfulness. The biscuits below seem to have a crisp firm nut. The taste is very special!

Brownie Ice Cream $ 180: It has been made for a long time, because Browni is baking, the slightly hot Brownney with vanilla ice cream is really delicious!At the same time, eat the aroma of chocolate and vanilla.

Drinking ""Freedom Hills and Fruit Tea, Cotton Sugar Fresh milk thick milk tea""
Freedom Qiu fruit tea ice $ 150: Must -order refreshment!The fruits (apples, kiwi, and Liu Ding) can be eaten first, otherwise it will fall to the ground. The materials are rich and the fruit is sweet and sour.

Marshmallow fresh milk thick milk tea ice $ 150: It is not bad to add marshmallow with milk tea, but it may be that fresh milk is comprehensive black tea. It does not feel very sweet. You can first tell the shopian that you want to make sweetness.

After a whole afternoon, I was lucky enough to have a thunderstorm after the afternoon. There were only a few drops of sun rain hahaha. The wind was not large that day, which was very suitable for chatting with friends.Looking up, you can see that the high -rise building has a great contrast with the freedom hill. It is suitable to find the countryside, nostalgia, and relaxation in the city.

Provide:
Outdoor smoking area
restroom
Wifi
Charging
Mosquito coils, anti -mosquito liquid
Uber Eat

Store:
The clerk is enthusiastic and friendly service is very good
There are mosquito coils are super like
The meal is also very delicious

"在台北市的都市水泥叢林當中
竟然有一個相當特別的地方
抱著極大的好奇心和期待
從巷弄中走進來完全無法想像的咖啡店
哇噻！真的酷…
咖啡飲品跟蛋糕有著相當高的CP值
喜歡吃蛋糕的人，不要太晚過來…
個人超級大推：鐵觀音重乳酪👍
因為很容易就賣完了😅
室內為數不多的座位，就要看運氣了
相當復古風格的設計，讓人一坐就是很久
室外的座位個人也很喜歡，白天夜晚都有不同的感覺…牆上的塗鴉及一些裝置藝術，都讓人忘記了身處在都市大樓之中…
夜晚氣溫下降時，室外還有加熱器可以取暖，相當貼心的服務。由於室外是開放空間，有吸菸座位，對於菸味反感的人，要有心理準備
在台北市文山區的市中心有一個相當適合放鬆的地方，實屬難得，確實值得再度造訪😊","In the urban cement jungle in Taipei City
There is a quite special place
Holding great curiosity and expectations
Come in from the alley that is completely unimaginable coffee shop
Wow!Really cool ...
Cafe with coffee drinks and cakes has a high CP value
People who like to eat cake, don't come too late ...
Personal super push: Tieguanyin heavy cheese 👍 👍
Because it is easy to sell it 就
There are a few seats in the room, it depends on luck
Quite retro -style design makes people sit for a long time
Outdoor seats also like it very much, and there are different feelings during the day and night ... The graffiti and some installation art on the wall make people forget that they are in the urban building ...
When the temperature drops at night, there is a heater that can be heated outdoors, which is quite intimate.Due to the open space outdoors and smoking seats. For those who are disgusted with smoke, they must be mentally prepared.
There is a place that is quite suitable for relaxation in the city center of Wenshan District, Taipei City. It is rare. It is really worth visiting again."
"位置有點隱密
要從遠傳旁邊的巷子走進去即可到達
有戶外及室內都有位置
氣氛很好👍
餐點及飲品大致上也不錯👌🏻
紅絲絨蛋糕體有點乾
肉桂捲很香❤️
店家還附送一碗堅果給我們配著聊天吃 👍","The location is a bit secret
Go in from the alleys next to the distant transmission, you can get it
There are locations in outdoor and indoor
The atmosphere is very good 👍
The meals and drinks are roughly good 👌🏻
Red velvet cake is a bit dry

The store also comes with a bowl of nuts with a chat with chat."
沒機會內用但看起來氣氛十足。,"There is no chance to use it, but it looks full of atmosphere."
咖啡和甜點都在水準之上，定價也很親民，可惜服務有點冷,"Coffee and desserts are above the standard, and the pricing is also very close to the people. Unfortunately, the service is a bit cold"
走進住宅區的小巷，進入一處咖啡小館，這裡融合了懷舊風、文青風、工業風，有著各種多元風格元素的陳設，一邊聽著Lunch音樂，也品嚐香濃拿鐵和甜點，沒有過多的言語暢聊，就默默地過了一個悠閒的假日午後，相當的舒服。,"Entering the alleys of the residential area, enter a small coffee shop, which combines nostalgia, Wenqing style, and industrial style. It has various diverse style elements. Dessert, without too much speech, silently spent a leisurely holiday afternoon, quite comfortable."

"可惜下雨戶外濕濕的，就坐在室內
裡面小小的很溫馨，佈置很特別
店員很親切，音樂很好聽
當天有買飲料就能算塔羅牌的活動也很有趣

在室內還是一直聞到外面的煙味
但下次還是想體驗晚上來喝酒的氛圍哈哈","Unfortunately, it is rainy outdoors and wet, so I sit in the room

But next time I want to experience the atmosphere of drinking at night haha ​​haha"
"古宅風格，內部裝潢的很舒服
位子還蠻多的，大約2張4人桌，2-3人桌8-10張，有些桌子旁邊有插座。

木柵難得有這麼chill 的一家小店，拿鐵味道不錯，因為下雨只能在室內，不然朋友在戶外一起攤著應該很不錯，因為不是禁菸環境，偶爾會有濃濃菸味飄來，怕的人可能就要注意一下,"Muzha has such a small shop in such a ChILL.

"今天和朋友第一次去這家店
我點紅絲絨蛋糕+焦糖瑪奇朵
本人飲料都點全糖，所以瑪奇朵甜甜的很棒
但建議不喝太甜的可以點別的，感覺也不錯
紅絲絨蛋糕甜度就很適中，很好吃也很大塊
裝潢布置很有趣，有室外也有室內
廁所意外的很大、很香，很加分
整體來說是個很舒服的地方
五顆星讚讚！！！","Today I went to this shop for the first time with my friends
I ordered red velvet cake+caramel Macchido

The decoration layout is very interesting, there are outdoor and indoor

咖啡順口 甜點普通 大熱天不適合去 室內空間幾乎感受不到冷氣 室外有人抽菸 不習慣菸味的人要留意 但店員很親切給推,Coffee dessert desserts are not suitable for indoor space. People who do n’t feel air -conditioning outdoor people who smoke are not used to smoke.

服務很不錯，不小心掉落叉子，還在一陣猶豫要不要再跟店員拿一根時，他們就貼心地送到桌邊了,"The service is very good, accidentally dropped the fork, and hesitated for a while to get one with the clerk, they sent it to the table intimately."
"深巷子內，在市區卻有與世隔絕的氣氛。店員都很親切，頗有深夜食堂的感覺。
最喜歡戶外的位置，不過比較受限於天氣，建議去之前評估一下天氣因素（不過如果小雨，在室內也別有氣氛）","In the deep alley, there is an isolated atmosphere in the urban area.The clerk is very kind and feels like late -night cafeteria.
I like the location of the outdoor the most, but it is more limited to the weather. It is recommended to evaluate the weather factors before (but if light rain, there is no atmosphere in the room)"
台北秘境景點，走進小巷弄後，令人驚喜的空間，特別的氛圍，咖啡和甜點都很可口，下次還會在造訪,"Taipei Secret Scenic Spots, after walking into the alley, the surprising space, a special atmosphere, coffee and desserts are very delicious, and will be visiting next time"

從舊的自由之丘，到新的自由之丘，來過無數次的好地方，環境舒適的咖啡廳，很推的一個木柵好地方，相信大家會喜歡的，棒棒的。,"From the old freedom hills to the new freedom hills, there have been countless good places, comfortable environmental cafes, and a good place for wooden grids. I believe everyone will like it."
行經狹窄的巷弄，抵達目的地後有種豁然開朗的感覺，那一瞬間能明白老闆取名自由之丘的意思,"After the narrow alley, there was a sudden and cheerful feeling after arriving at the destination."
點了檸檬咖啡及焦糖蘋果溫蛋糕非常喜歡，店員跟老闆都超級親切友善，店內環境氛圍也很讓人舒服,I ordered lemon coffee and caramel apple cakes very much. The clerks and bosses are super friendly and friendly. The environment atmosphere in the store is also very comfortable.

"最近幾年木柵多了好多個人特色的職人咖啡店，但很少遇到咖啡好喝、糕點好吃、環境氣氛佳，又同時老闆和員工是溫暖、貼心的，「自由の丘」就是！💕
今天和好朋友久逢相聚，聊到欲罷不能，但礙於店家假日有內用限時兩小時的要求，也不好意思耽誤後面排隊客人的時間，還好店外有長椅可以讓我們再繼續盡興聊，突然老闆親自端來兩杯開水，抱歉的說：因假日客人多才有內用限時的安排，希望沒有招待不周而感受不佳，喝完的水杯儘管放著就好！
服務業太競爭了，除了店家特色之外，真心的服務熱忱也很重要，才留得住客人！
已經很少遇到這麼溫暖的店家了…值得推薦👍","最近幾年木柵多了好多個人特色的職人咖啡店，但很少遇到咖啡好喝、糕點好吃、環境氣氛佳，又同時老闆和員工是溫暖、貼心的，「自由の丘」就是！💕

藏匿在大樓巷弄裡，真的很特別，這次時間太趕了，下次再來好好品嚐咖啡一下,It is really special in hiding in the building alley. This time is too rushing. Let's taste coffee next time.
冰美式不錯，推薦用店家細吸管喝底部的咖啡，不一樣,"The ice American style is good, it is recommended to use the store to drink the coffee at the bottom, different"

布朗尼好吃，但位置隱密，來回走了好幾次才發現,"Browni is delicious, but the location is secretly, and I will go back and forth several times before discovering"
很喜歡。覺得就像自由。地方小但每個角落充滿特色。很喜歡手作的部份。晚上來應該更棒更美麗……,I like it very much.I feel like freedom.The local is small but every corner is full of characteristics.I like the part of the hand.It should be better and more beautiful at night ...
氣氛不錯！服務生妹妹很親切！甜點不會過甜^_^只是熱水果茶來的時候是溫的，有點可惜……有改進的空間～,"The atmosphere is good!The waiter sister is very kind!The dessert will not be too sweet^_^It's just warm when hot fruit tea comes, it is a pity ... There is room for improvement ~"
氣氛佳東西也不錯，藏身巷弄裡很有探險的感覺,The atmosphere is good and good.
拿鐵及溫蛋糕不錯吃♥️,Latte and warm cakes are good to eat 蛋 ️

驚艷的紅絲絨蛋糕，會讓人想要再次光顧，期待你們的餐點，過年期間可能人手不足，熱咖啡上餐時已經是冷的了，天氣很冷的時候店家再留意喔。,"The stunning red velvet cake will make people want to patronize again. I look forward to your meals. During the Chinese New Year, people may be insufficient. The hot coffee is already cold. When the weather is cold, the store will pay attention to it."

"<自由之丘CCIP & CAFE> 木柵巷弄隱藏的秘境咖啡廳
藏於住宅區的高樓內，像是童話故事般地穿過防火巷後赫然發現一塊小天地。
寬闊的戶外區，可以隨意地坐在人工草皮上，有時晚上還會有電影投影在舊牆上讓大家一同欣賞；老闆刻意把座位區開口的方向朝向沒有被高樓擋住的那塊天空，希望客人可以在這都市叢林哩，有自己的一片天空可以喘息。
這塊空間是""自由之丘""與""岸汐職人部落""共用的空間，室內座位區後方就是他們的工作室，如果要參觀也可以請他們協助。這邊原本是個製作麵線的小工廠，工廠歇業後由老闆承租下來改造成了新的天地。
飲料除了咖啡之外也有提供調酒，也有甜點和鹹食。
不論是黑咖啡、拿鐵或是調酒都在水準之上，隱藏版的檸檬塔也深得我心，而且價格相當親民，實在有點想私藏這麼棒的空間。
入口之一是木柵路三段101號遠傳電信旁的巷弄，走到底就會發現這片世外桃源。
白天和晚上各有不同風情，但畢竟附近還是住宅區，享受的同時也別忘記注意音量喔!

黑咖啡:$80  榛果拿鐵:$120  水果茶:$120  檸檬塔:$150
自由古巴:$150  紳士丹尼爾:$150","<Free Hill CCIP & CAFE> Muzha Lane hidden secret coffee shop
Hidden in the high -rise building hidden in the residential area, he found a small world after passing through the fire lane like a fairy tale.
The wide outdoor area can sit on the artificial turf at will, and sometimes there are movie projection on the old wall at night for everyone to appreciate it together; the boss deliberately puts the seat of the seat area towards the sky that is not blocked by the high -rise building. I hope the guests hope the guests You can breathe in this city jungle, with your own sky.
This space is a space shared by the ""Liberal Hill"" and ""Shore Titan Tribe"". Behind the indoor seat area is their studio. If you want to visit, you can also ask them to assist.Here are a small factory that made noodles. After the factory is closed, the boss is rented and transformed into a new world.
In addition to coffee, drinks also provide bartending, as well as desserts and salty food.
Whether it is black coffee, latte, or bartender, it is above the standard. The hidden version of the lemon tower also won my heart, and the price is quite close to the people. It really wants to hide such a great space.
One of the entrances is the alley next to the far -end telecommunications of No. 101, Section 3, Muzha Road. When you walk in the end, you will find this paradise.
There are different styles during the day and evening, but after all, there are still residential areas. Do n’t forget to pay attention to the volume while enjoying it!

蠻舒適可以跟朋友來聊聊天的咖啡廳，戶外有開放式的空間也很free，但可能會比較多煙味，不夠過還有室內有座位與冷氣可以容納客人。,"It is quite comfortable to chat with friends to chat with friends. There is an open space outdoors. It may also be free, but there may be more smoke flavor. There is not enough too much. There are seats and air -conditioning in the room to accommodate guests."
很讚,Great
真正巷子內的城市綠洲，別有洞天，值得一訪。,"The urban oasis in the real alley, there are no holes, it is worth visiting."
"今天第一次去，感覺不錯，店家很客氣。座位有室內跟室外，室外感覺比較自由，沒搭棚子的時侯可以看到天空。
今天點了榛果拿鐵，味道不錯，不會太甜。","The first time I went today, it feels good, the store is very polite.The seats are indoors and outdoors. The outdoor feels free. When you do n’t have a shed, you can see the sky.
I ordered hazelnut latte today. The taste is good and not too sweet."

不太適合千里迢迢，定位比較像是社區日常。

"自由之丘是東京有名的住宅區，尤其以北部區域的西洋風格的房屋最為顯目，但是在住宅區中也散布著很多餐館商店等商業設施。該地區正如地名中所透露的，有很多小山丘，尤其以二丁目和三丁目最多。只有自由之丘車站附近，才是一片比較平緩的土地。

早在1932年之前，原本是沒有「自由之丘」這個地名的。當時該地區屬於東京府荏原郡衾村。1927年，日本教育家手塚岸衛（日語：手塚岸衛）在該地區創辦了自由之丘學園（日語：自由ヶ丘学園高等学校），旨在傳播自由主義理念。1932年，隨著東京都版圖的擴張，目黑區建立，該地區也隨著這個機會改名為「自由之丘」。

自由之丘原本保留了很多竹林，但是在20世紀70年代，隨著東急集團（日語：東急グループ）對東急東橫線的開發，砍伐了大量竹林，現在這些竹林的痕跡只能在自由之丘的熊野神社中才能找到了。

由於自由之丘素來以住宅區著稱，加上周圍景色優美，交通便利，商業設施齊全，所以在東京地區的一些雜誌的民意調查中，自由之丘被列為最想居住的地方之一。","自由之丘是東京有名的住宅區，尤其以北部區域的西洋風格的房屋最為顯目，但是在住宅區中也散布著很多餐館商店等商業設施。該地區正如地名中所透露的，有很多小山丘，尤其以二丁目和三丁目最多。只有自由之丘車站附近，才是一片比較平緩的土地。

隱身小小巷子內，眼不夠尖還真不容易發現，據老闆說都是熟客才知道門路穿進來，經過小小巷子後眼前一小庭院有著回到家鄉老宅到感動，直得悠閒放空的場域，只是喝不到手沖咖啡,"In the hidden alley, it is really not easy to find that the eyes are not sharp enough. According to the boss, it is known that the doorway has come in. After passing through the small alley, a small courtyard in front of the eyes is moved back to the old house in my hometown to move.

高樓中的一塊小空地，飲料普通，但放鬆的感覺彌補一切，建議沒下雨的時候坐外面，很舒適,"A small space in the high -rise building, the drink is ordinary, but the feeling of relaxation makes up for everything. It is recommended to sit outside when it does not rain. It is very comfortable."

很放鬆的地方！很有離開城市喧鬧的咖啡廳！他還有一些課程可以上，有興趣可以詢問工作人員~,"Very relaxed place!Very leaving the city's noisy cafes!He also has some courses to take it. If you are interested, you can ask the staff ~"
藏身防火牆巷內，環境舒適，飲品味道不錯，會推薦給到萬芳、木柵附近的朋友,"Hidden in the firewall lane, the environment is comfortable and the drink tastes good. It will be recommended to friends near Wanfang and Muzha"

"氣氛很好而且咖啡真的很美味！
菜單是英文的，我想老闆也會說英語。
然而，似乎很難找到路，因為它完全在巷子的角落裡，讓你懷疑這是不是這個地方。","The atmosphere is very good and coffee is really delicious!
The menu is English, and I think the boss will speak English too.
However, it seems difficult to find a way, because it is completely in the corner of the alley, making you doubt whether this is the place."
如果你在木柵，一定要來看看這個地方。從小黑巷到了空曠的地方。喝杯咖啡，嚐嚐他們的藍莓起司蛋糕。生活是美好的！但是，請注意這些錯誤...吸血嚴重:(,"If you are in Muzha, be sure to look at this place.From the black alley to the open place.Drink a cup of coffee and taste their blueberry cheese cake.Life is beautiful!However, please pay attention to these errors ... Vampire is serious :_"
很酷的地方很酷的氛圍還有非常好的咖啡。然而菜單選擇有限。建議大家先填飽肚子再進來！,"The cool place is very cool and there are very good coffee.However, the menu selection is limited.It is recommended that you fill in your stomach first and then come in!"
