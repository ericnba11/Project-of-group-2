"雞排是古早味雞排，鹹香有味很好吃。

味道很香東湖的黑胡椒雞排

而且紙袋還有打洞，很加分！

不過生意太好，或是品項太多；加上只有老闆一個人，感覺忙不過來。等待時間真的太久。","Chicken steaks are ancient and early chicken steaks. The salty fragrance is delicious.

The black pepper chicken chop that tastes very fragrant

And there are holes in paper bags, which are very extra points!

However, the business is too good, or there are too many items; plus only the boss is alone, I feel that I can't be busy.The waiting time is really too long."
幹太強了👍我愛上了👍甜不辣一定要的。,Gan is strong. I fall in love with sweetness and not spicy.
"目前點過地瓜 雞排 雞翅 雞塊 雞腿，全部都在水準之上，價格也很有競爭力；雖然店面外觀稍嫌粗糙，卻能在食物包裝上、在食物本體上接收到老闆有一套美味兼具衛生標準的堅持
很猶豫要不要給大推薦，但老闆真的很優秀，我已經做好要更早預約的準備了","At present, the sweet potato chicken row chicken chicken chicken legs are all above the standard, and the price is also very competitive; although the appearance of the store is slightly rough, it can receive a set of delicious and delicious sets of boss on food packaging and food body. Persistence with hygiene standards
I was hesitant to recommend big recommendations, but the boss is really excellent. I have done ready to make an appointment earlier."
好吃的炸雞.雞排.薯角，但客人很多 通常我會點餐後再來拿，不然要等30分鐘左右,"The delicious fried chicken. Chicken steak. French fries, but many guests usually come to get after ordering, otherwise they have to wait about 30 minutes"
"價格親民份量足
雞排好吃，但薯條跟甜不辣炸到太硬了不好吃","Price and people are sufficient
The chicken chop is delicious, but the fries and sweetness are not spicy too hard, it’s too hard, it’s not delicious"
卡啦炸雞類都很棒，雞塊是雞腿排那塊，忙碌時放有點久才吃也依然很脆，不會軟掉。有時人很多建議先電話預約詢問需等待時間，時間到再去拿。,"The fried chicken is great. The chicken nuggets are the chicken legs. It is still crispy for a long time to eat it for a long time, and it will not be softened.Sometimes many people recommend calling for an appointment to ask for time, and time to get it."
"一開始就問會不會等很久，說二十分鐘就好
結果後來只是暫離去隔壁拿菜，回來的時候，剛好有聽到有客人剛來在問銀絲卷怎麼樣怎麼樣，結果後來她竟然先拿到餐（不只一位比我慢點餐的客人先拿到餐）
等了大概四十幾分鐘，好吃的話真的很願意等，但就算這樣，出餐還是應該要有先後次序 ==","At the beginning, I asked if I would wait for a long time, and it would be good to say 20 minutes
As a result, I just left the food next door. When I came back, I just heard a guest who just came to ask how the silver roll was. As a result, she even got the meal (not only a guest who ordered the meal slower than me. Get the meal first)
After waiting for about forty minutes, if you are delicious, you really want to wait, but even so, there should be a sequence of meals =="
餐點好吃，老闆親切,"The meal is delicious, the boss is kind"
"雞排好吃 調味很香
肉質軟 不柴不乾 肉厚
紙袋上有透氣孔
拿回家不至於會軟爛
還是有脆度
等候時間約7~8分鐘","Chicken steak delicious and seasoning
Soft meat, no dry, meat, thick meat, thick meat
There are breathable holes on the paper bag
It won't be soft and rotten if you take it home
Still crispy
Waiting time is about 7 ~ 8 minutes"

Gover's spiritual praise ~ (▽ ▽ ＾)"
東西好吃、但是目前只有老闆一位、等待時間會比較久；東西剛炸出來怕客人燙口、不會那麼快交給客人、大家要多等一下、別猴急一直催促～,"The things are delicious, but at present, there is only one boss, waiting for a long time; when things are fried, they are afraid of the guests, and they will not give it to the guests so soon."
很喜歡他們的炸雞翅～只是真的需要久候，可以先訂再取,"I like their fried chicken wings very much ~ I just need to wait for a long time, you can order before picking it up"
甜不辣好吃，雞丁比較重口味適合下酒。炸的很酥，完全不油膩,"Sweet is not spicy and delicious.The frying is very crispy, it's not greasy at all"
推薦 大份雞米花 甜粿 超級無敵好吃,"Recommend a large chicken rice, sweet and sweet 份 super invincible delicious"
比我後面買的竟然比我快取餐？配餐排序有問題，雞排口味也普通，不會特別跑去買了。,"I bought it faster than me after I bought it later?There is a problem with the sorting of meals, and the chicken steak tastes ordinary, and will not go to buy it."
甜不辣是極品，卡拉雞塊也好吃。排隊人潮真的超多的。這兩樣總是很快賣光。,"Sweet and not spicy is the best, and Kara chicken nuggets are delicious.There are really many people in line.These two are always sold out quickly."
"老闆很省話😅
卡拉雞排好吃 其他還好","The boss is very saving 话
The Kara chicken steak is delicious and other is okay"
"卡啦雞排.甜不辣.百頁豆腐 超級好吃😋
但是要等很久 最好先打電話訂 …","Card chicken chop. Sweet and not spicy. Hundred pages of tofu are super delicious
But it is best to call for a long time ..."
甜不辣很讚~ 薯條胡椒鹽弄太多太鹹... 雞排在平均水平~,Sweet and not spicy and very good ~ It is too salty to get fries and pepper and salt ... The chicken steak is at the average level ~
"已經開店很久了，超好吃，很推薦
老闆人很好，有時還會聊天","I have opened the store for a long time, super delicious, very recommended
The boss is very good, and sometimes he chats"
告訴你一個小秘密 這家窩在小巷子的 炸雞店 口味很棒老闆很親切 值得一試,"Tell you a small secret, this fried chicken shop in the alley is very good, the boss is very kind and worth trying"
動作慢就算了，需要等半小時以上應該先知會一聲，點兩樣東西而已，等快一個小時,"Even if the movement is slow, you need to wait more than half an hour or more. You should have a prophet, just order two things, wait for an hour for almost an hour."
炸雞鮮嫩而且炸油乾淨，外酥內軟的膨膨甜不辣也很推薦！,"The fried chicken is tender and clean, and the soft and softness of the inside is also recommended. It is also recommended!"
"卡啦雞排普通，炸的沒有很酥脆
撒粉也是隨便撒，有些地方很鹹","The card chicken chop is ordinary, and the fried is not very crispy
Sprinkle is also randomly sprinkled, some places are salty"
炸物好吃，只是遇到高峰人多時間就要等…等…,"The fried objects are delicious, but you have to wait for a long time when you meet the peak people ... Wait ... wait ..."
雞米花真好吃，其他炸物也有水準之上,"Chicken and rice flowers are so delicious, and other fried objects also have a standard level"
是好吃，但常沒開又常接不來,"It's delicious, but I often can't pick it up"
老闆煮東西的樣子很認真，東西也很好吃。,"The boss cooked things very seriously, and things were delicious."
老闆換人了？炸雞沒以前好吃,Is the boss replaced?The fried chicken was not delicious before
好吃 要等 可以先預訂,"If you are delicious, you can book first"
