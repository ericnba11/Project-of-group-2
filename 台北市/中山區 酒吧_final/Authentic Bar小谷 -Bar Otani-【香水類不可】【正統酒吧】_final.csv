"非常隱密而且氣氛獨特的無酒單小Bar。在穿過老大樓內的一樓矮門之後馬上可以感受到一種都會中難以尋覓的靜謐感。

老闆是日本人（蠻多客人也是），不過點酒上的溝通並不會太困難，對雞尾酒稍有認識的人可以直接指定酒種或品牌，也可以直接告知想要的酸甜苦口味、酒感、濃度、元素，老闆也會直接量身客製，並且在遞上酒時把主要挑選的酒一併展示。

店內的氣氛相對一般酒吧的熱鬧氣氛來說是比較迴異的，第一次步入可能會被寧靜的空間嚇到不太敢說話，連音樂都是沒有的。不過如果空間內有另一組人開始低聲聊天之後就比較沒那麼衝擊了www 當然這也跟不接待一組超過兩位的客人政策有關係。

Bar小谷的酒真的很棒，推薦給想放鬆一下，給自己尋找片刻寧靜和微醺的人。","Very hidden and unique atmosphere.After passing through the dwarf door on the first floor of the old building, you can immediately feel a sense of tranquility that is difficult to find.

The boss is Japanese (there are many guests), but the communication on the wine is not too difficult.

The wine feel, concentration, and elements, the boss will also be tailor -made directly, and it will be displayed together to show the main selection of wine when handing the wine.

The atmosphere in the store is relatively different from the lively atmosphere of the bar. The first time you can step into the tranquility space, you don't even dare to speak, not even music.However, if there is another group of people in the space, it is less impacting WwW.

"隱身在林森北路巷弄裡的個性小店。
店裡的規矩就放在門口牆上，不能大聲喧嘩，不接受三人以上團體客人，同意方可入內，低矮的拉門讓每位客人都必須彎腰低頭才能踏進店裡，由此可見老闆的個性，不過這種日本職人特有的執拗和堅持並不惹人厭，反倒優雅地讓人覺得有些欽佩。
第一次踏進店裡的時候有些被裡頭幾乎伸手不見五指的幽暗嚇到，唯一的光源是每張座位桌前的小夜燈，在黑暗中隱隱透著微光。
店裡無酒單，想喝什麼要和老闆溝通，雖然老闆是日本人，但基本的中文溝通完全沒有問題，之後老闆會在客人面前親自調製飲料，老闆的手藝優雅細膩，安靜而不過分喧嘩，一如店裡的裝潢和氛圍。
唯一的缺點是店裡沒有洗手間，想上廁所必須要去外頭大廈社區的有些骯髒老舊的公共廁所，雖然不至於無法接受，但總會讓剛從店裡出來的人有種回到現實的感覺，有些掃興。

"這是間位在條通舊式大樓裡很酷的日式酒吧，整間店烏漆抹黑僅有微弱的燈光，冰塊和酒液的碰撞聲是店內最肆無忌憚的聲響。Bar小谷無酒單、無供餐食、沒有音樂、不接受預約、不接待超過2人的團體。在這微光、低音量的環境氛圍，相當適合細細品味每杯酒的韻味🍸

由於沒有酒單，點酒時可以向老闆小谷先生直接點想喝的調酒；在店內觀察到大部分的情況是，客人會與小谷先生討論想喝的口味與基酒，小谷先生再根據客人提供的喜好客製化調酒。調酒製作前，也會先跟客人確認將使用的基酒並說明基酒富含的調性與風味，上酒後會將使用的調酒材料一瓶瓶擺放在客人的座位跟前，製作的調酒相當有水準。覺得這次的造訪是個相當有趣的體驗，值得再訪。店內只有９個座位，到訪時還有沒有位置就只能碰碰運氣了。

初訪：
這次依序點了 Gin Tonic、Vesper Martini 、White Negroni、Last Word","This is a cool Japanese -style bar in the old -fashioned building. The whole shop has only weak lights. The collision of ice cubes and wine liquid is the most unscrupulous sound in the shop.Bar Kobaya has no wine list, no meals, no music, no reservation, and no more than two people.In this environmental atmosphere of light and low volume, it is quite suitable for the charm of each glass of wine.

Because there is no wine list, when you order wine, you can directly order the bartender that Mr. Kobayashi wants to drink. Most of the situations are observed in the store. The guests will discuss the taste and base wine they want to drink with Mr. Kobaya. The preferences provide customized bartending.Before the bartending production, it will also confirm with the guests to confirm the tone and flavor of the base wine used and explain the richness and flavor of the base wine. After the wine is put on the wine, the bartender used in the wine will be placed in front of the guest's seat. The bartender is quite standard.I think this visit is a very interesting experience and it is worth visiting.There are only 9 seats in the store, and there is only a place where you can only touch your luck when you visit.

我去過台北最酷的酒吧。它位於一棟大樓下的小巷裡，不顯眼。在進入之前，請仔細閱讀規則，以免成為那些吵鬧、令人討厭的顧客之一，肯定會引起惱怒的目光。一旦你低下頭，打開拉門，你就會進入一個燈光昏暗的酒吧，大約有 10 個座位。沒有菜單。簡而言之，讓調酒師知道您通常喜歡或渴望什麼類型的酒。例如，我要了一杯以威士忌為基礎的飲料，並且特別想要一些不含大量糖且相對較烈的飲料。下一杯飲料時，我想要一些茶味的東西，他為我做了一杯杜松子酒。兩者都很棒，每喝一杯，調酒師都會將用於調製飲料的瓶子帶到您面前，供您檢查和享用。我不願意寫這篇評論，因為這絕對是一顆隱藏的寶石，但它太好了，無法不分享。請負責任地享受！,"I have been the coolest bar in Taipei.It is located in an alley under a building, which is not conspicuous.Before entering, please read the rules carefully to avoid becoming one of the noise and annoying customers, and it will definitely cause anger.Once you lower your head and open the sliding door, you will enter a dim light, with about 10 seats.No menu.In short, let the bartender know what type of wine you usually like or long.For example, I want a drink based on whiskey, and I especially want some drinks that do not contain a large amount of sugar and relatively strong.In the next drink, I want some tea -flavored things. He made a glass of Du Songzi wine for me.The two are great.

說實話，我很慶幸台灣有這家店，也很慶幸它營業到凌晨2點30分。","The atmosphere here is very suitable for hidden bars. Although it is a mature bar, the price is very average.
Even the master's craftsmanship, cocktails, and the harmony of each drink make me feel a feeling of being trained in the standard bar in Japan.
Many of the liquid wines used are rare, and the choice of the master is also very good. The simple cocktail has a delicious and unique taste.
To be honest, I am very fortunate to have this store in Taiwan, and I am very fortunate that it will open until 2:30 in the morning.",0.206,0.0,0.794,0.9705
我以前從未覺得有必要寫評級，但這裡的調酒師絕對是一位魔術師。我一生中從未嚐過如此美味的雞尾酒。強烈推薦。相信調酒師，給他最少的指導，他就會為你調製出令人驚嘆的東西。,"I never thought it was necessary to write rating, but the bartender here was definitely a magician.I have never tasted such a delicious cocktail in my life.Strongly recommended.Believe that the bartender, give him the least guidance, will make a amazing thing for you.",0.257,0.0,0.743,0.9413

這個地區最好的酒吧。請注意，這不是一個吵鬧的地方。主人很仁慈，不會強行帶走，但起碼的禮貌還是要遵守的。小聲地提出各種要求（笑），然後讓他們為您提供適合您的杯子。你會度過一段美好的時光。,"The best bar in this area.Please note that this is not a noisy place.The owner is kind and will not take away forcibly, but at least the politeness still must be observed.Make a whispering request (laughs), and then let them provide you with a cup suitable for you.You will spend a good time.",0.228,0.0,0.772,0.9218
"我希望店主不要假設每個新顧客都透過心靈感應進行交流，並且知道您的商店運營的系統。如果你在門上貼一個牌子，上面寫著“容量已滿”，這對每個人都會更有幫助，這是一種燈箱，在吧台處有一個觸摸按鈕開關，可以由工作人員在監控裡面的情況時進行控制。

當我打開門時，裡面一片漆黑，氣氛絕對不友善。過了一會兒才適應，這時我注意到調酒師默默地向我揮手。我以為這是一種問候。我向前踏了一步，突然意識到這實際上是一種「再見」的揮手。感覺自己像個不受歡迎的入侵者，突然破壞了他精心打造的安靜空間。非常失望，因為一個朋友強烈推薦它，而且我走了很長的路才找到它。","I hope that the owner will not assume that every new customer communicates through the mind and knows the system of your store operation.If you post a sign on the door, which says ""the capacity is full"", this will be more helpful for everyone.

When I opened the door, the inside was dark, and the atmosphere was absolutely not friendly.After a while before adapting, I noticed that the bartender silently waved to me silently.I thought this was a greeting.I took a step forward and suddenly realized that this was actually a ""goodbye"" wave.It feels like an unpopular invader, suddenly destroying the quiet space he created.Very disappointed because a friend highly recommended it, and I found it for a long time.",0.091,0.044,0.865,0.7258
完全關注雞尾酒。沒有音樂、燈光和大聲轉換的干擾。如果您無法應對並且害怕小黑暗的地方，那麼這裡不適合您。如果您真的喜歡不尋常且挑戰口味的雞尾酒，那麼您就來了。,"Focus on cocktails.There is no interference of music, lighting and loud conversion.If you can't deal with and are afraid of small darkness, then it is not suitable for you.If you really like unusual and challenged cocktails, then you are here.",0.063,0.126,0.811,-0.204
光是氣氛就值得了，飲料也很好——沒有菜單。雖然並不是所有的雞尾酒都像我期望的那樣，但我仍然會再次去安靜地聊天。,"The atmosphere alone is worth it, and the drink is very good -no menu.Although not all cocktails are as expected, I will still chat quietly again.",0.169,0.066,0.764,0.4754

"這個地方是光輝的統治者。

你可以訂購任何你喜歡的東西：一種感覺、情緒、給他看一張照片、告訴他一種顏色，任何你能想到的東西他絕對會以液體形式釘下來。
我要了一杯“該死的好咖啡”，他卻把它喝掉了。
那天是他 30 歲生日，所以我們要了一個生日蛋糕，他做了液體形式的。
我的朋友要求參加一場綜合格鬥比賽，他調製了一杯飲料，讓你感覺自己正被一塊滿頭大汗的紋身牛肉餅壓著。
街頭幫派？不是問題！不久之後，我們就被詹姆斯·迪恩圍住了，而方齊則跳過了我們倆以及我們飲料中的鯊魚。

參觀了這個地方後，我意識到其他所有酒吧都沒有嘗試過，需要回去睡覺。

iirc 團體最多可容納 4 人，總共只有大約 12-15 個座位。
最好的方法是預訂或在開放時間到達，因為它很快就滿了，而且你不知道人們會待多久。

最低訂購金額約為新台幣 500 美元，飲料每份約為 300 美元，如果您來自澳大利亞珀斯，這個價格並不算貴，在那裡您可以以這個價格買到 1/2 瓶用過的水。

也不要吝嗇，給他小費！","This place is a glorious rulers.

You can order anything you like: a feeling, emotion, showing him a photo, and telling him a color. What you can think of will be nailed down in the form of liquid.
I asked for a ""damn good coffee"", but he drank it.
It was his 30th birthday that day, so we asked for a birthday cake, and he made a liquid form.
My friend asked to participate in a comprehensive fighting competition. He made a cup of drink, making you feel that he was pressed by a sweat tattoo beef cake.
Street gang?Not a problem!Soon after, we were surrounded by James Dien, while Fang Qi skipped the sharks in the two of us and our drinks.

After visiting this place, I realized that all other bars had never tried and needed to go back to sleep.

IIRC groups can accommodate up to 4 people, with only about 12-15 seats in total.
The best way is to book or arrive at the opening time, because it is full soon, and you don't know how long it will stay.

The minimum order amount is about $ 500, and the drink is about $ 300 per copy. If you come from Perth, Australia, the price is not expensive, where you can buy 1/2 bottles of water at this price.
