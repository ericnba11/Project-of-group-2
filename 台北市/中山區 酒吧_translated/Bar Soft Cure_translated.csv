"酒吧搭載專業音響似乎成了新風潮。

中山區晚餐後本來想去 Turning Point，但不巧沒有位子；而這間 Soft Cure 距離僅幾分鐘路程，看起來也是近一年才新開的。狹長的空間主要就是吧台座位，而最醒目的絕對是後方酒牆兩側的音響與中間的黑膠區塊。

樂曲、歌詞及酒精的結合。

酒單設計挺有意思的，饒富詩意的酒名都來自於不同歌曲所帶來的感受或迴響；既然如此，來一杯【迷離在音符之前】再適合不過。清爽的西瓜與微甜的梅酒淡化掉 Rum 的氣味，Campari 的苦同時被柔和了不少，很適合輕鬆開場。

酒如其名的【獨自一人在京都】有淡淡花香、茶香，配上柚子酒的清甜，真的滿滿和風感，但酒感其實比預期的還要再重一些。【似夢似醒】則是取於 Radiohead 電台頭的歌，用茶酒元素翻玩 White Negroni，喜歡苦甜感的不能錯過。

除了整間店的路線很明確與音樂連接外，老闆還在酒單上特別強調不能喧嘩除了他的音樂，加上跟其他酒客聊天的內容，感覺得出來對於音樂的喜愛與堅持。也確實陸陸續續換了幾張黑膠，都是很舒服、不影響喝酒的音樂，推薦可以來小酌幾杯放鬆放鬆。","The bar with professional audio seems to be a new wave.

After dinner in Zhongshan District, I wanted to go to Turning Point, but there was no one. There was no place; and this Soft Cure distance was only a few minutes away, and it seemed to be newly opened in the past year.The narrow space is mainly the bar seat, and the most eye -catching thing is definitely the audio on both sides of the wine wall and the vinyl block in the middle.

Combination of music, lyrics and alcohol.

The design of the wine list is very interesting. The poetic wine name comes from the feelings or response brought by different songs; in this case, a cup of [before the note] is suitable.The refreshing watermelon and slightly sweet plum wine faded the smell of Rum. The bitterness of Campari was softened at the same time, which was very suitable for easy opening.

The wine is named [alone in Kyoto] with a light flower fragrance and tea fragrance. With the sweetness of grapefruit wine, it is really full of style, but the sense of wine is actually heavier than expected.[Dream like awakening] is a song taken on Radiohead's radio. It is used to play White Negroni with tea wine elements. Those who like bitterness cannot be missed.

In addition to the entire store's route is clearly connected to music, the boss also emphasized on the wine list and emphasized that he could not make noise except for his music, and the content of chatting with other wine guests, and felt that he loved and insisted on music.It is indeed a few vinyl, which is very comfortable and does not affect drinking music. It is recommended to have a drink for a few glasses to relax."
"非常喜歡！整體的氛圍很舒服，店內也不會有奇怪的味道，大概是禁菸以及店內環境維護得很乾淨的緣故，雖說只有吧台的座位但老闆和另一位店員人都很nice 除非是常客否則大概不會執意搭話聊天，不需要太擔心會有壓力。
調酒是屬於比較大人口味的，酒精的味道會比較明顯赤裸，非常好喝！餐點也都很好吃，推薦布丁與蟹味增法國麵包🥖","I like it very much!The overall atmosphere is very comfortable, and there will be no strange taste in the store. It is probably because the smoking ban and the maintenance of the environment in the store are very clean. Although there are only seats on the bar, the boss and another shop staff are very nice. Will insist on chatting and chatting, you don't need to worry too much.
The bartending is relatively large and delicious. The taste of alcohol will be relatively naked and very delicious!The meals are also delicious, it is recommended to add pudding and crab flavor to French bread 🥖"
"就像偶然發現 Soft cure 這家店 播著我最喜愛的音樂

從第一張黑膠 The strokes is this it 到我要離開的 Radiohead ok computer  ….

才問老闆幾個問題 我就得一晚上壓抑想跟老闆聊音樂的慾望

但能知道Soft cure 真的太好了 只是怎麼這麼相見恨晚  點了兩杯酒感都很重 下酒菜也認真細緻的好吃

不管當天是多麼疲憊 也都會被這種浪漫的日常治癒
人生果然是由非常多細碎的片段所組成的一部紀錄作品

無論這四十年來是痛苦，貧乏，喜悅，滿足
我都不想跟任何人交換我的人生

謝謝 Bar Soft Cure","It's like I found my favorite music in Soft Cure.

From the first vinyl The Strokes is this it, to the Radiohead OK Computer I am going to leave ...

I only asked the boss a few questions. I have to suppress the desire to talk to the boss one night

But you can know that Soft Cure is really so good, but how did you meet and hate two glasses of wine late and have a lot of wine.

No matter how tired the day is, it will be cured by this romantic daily healing
Life is indeed a recorded work composed of a lot of fine fragments

Regardless of the pain, poor, joy, satisfaction
I don't want to exchange my life with anyone

Thank you Bar Soft Cure"
"超讚的音響設備加上黑膠，非常享受
調酒好喝，也有一些酷酷的威士忌🌝","The awesome audio equipment plus vinyl, very enjoyable
The bartending is delicious, there are some cool whiskey 🌝"
"偶然在網路上看到
店內的裝潢空間很有趣，基本上全部都是吧台座位
搭配超級大的音響還有黑膠唱片給人一種很舒服的感覺
在調酒部分本次點了gin fizz, old pal, penicillin 三杯，雖然都非酒單上的調酒，但也都做得很棒
同行友人點了幾杯酒單上的調酒也都頗具巧思，讓人之後會想再來
這次比較可惜的是沒有點到店內餐點，下次來的時候也可以再
結束後也被推薦了附近的其他酒吧，或許下次時間允許可以來個bar surfing","Occasied on the Internet
The decoration space in the shop is very interesting, basically all are bar seats
With super large audio and vinyl records give people a very comfortable feeling
I ordered three cups of Gin FIZZ, OLD PAL, PENICILLIN. Although they are not bartender on the alcohol, they are also very good
Coupled friends who ordered a few glasses of wine on the wine list are also quite ingenious, so that people will want to come again
This is a pity that I didn’t order meals in the store, and I can do it again next time
After the end, it was also recommended to have other nearby bars."
"【喝在台北：Bar Soft Cure 】

諮商所附近、林森北路一帶新開的 bar，
有吃有喝還有甜點，適合小吃小喝。

酒類有我喜歡的茶元素，香甜可口，
似乎也有大人酒感的選擇；
小食無論是雞胗或牛肚都美味下酒，
爽快吃喝才是人生。

大人風味的好多酒焦糖布丁也很不錯，
適合做為一天的完美收尾。","[Drink in Taipei: Bar Soft Cure]

Near the consulting office, the newly opened BAR
There are drinks and desserts, suitable for snacks.

The wine has the tea I like, sweet and delicious,
There seems to be a choice of adult wine;

Suitable for the perfect ending of the day."

"當我們進入時，Cocteau Twins 的《拉斯維加斯》或《天堂》正在播放，所以我已經知道就是這個地方了。

幾乎是完美的現代雞尾酒吧。

調酒師老闆慷慨地表達了他的熱情和經驗（隨機講述了有關高保真揚聲器歷史的花絮，以及台灣酒精進口稅政策的特殊性）。

樸實無華但深思熟慮且富有創意的招牌雞尾酒。

可以製作出合適的馬丁尼酒，捕捉顧客口味的細微差別（我和我的妻子表達了不同的喜好，調酒師使用了適合我們每個人的不同杜松子酒和苦艾酒組合）。

對烈酒的深入收集與認識。

老式 JBL 揚聲器和 McIntosh Amp (IYKYK)。

還有設計精美的內裝。

如果你來台北錯過了這個地方，你就錯過了台北的很大一部分。","When we enter, Cocteau Twins's ""Las Vegas"" or ""Paradise"" is being played, so I already know that it is this place.

Almost perfect modern cocktail bar.

The bartender owner generously expressed his enthusiasm and experience (randomly describes the tidbits about the history of the high -fidelity speaker, and the particularity of Taiwan's alcohol import tax policies).

Simply, thoughtful, and creative signature cocktails.

You can make the appropriate Martini wine to capture the subtle differences of customers' taste (I expressed different preferences with my wife, and the bartender uses different Du Songzi wine and bitter wine combinations suitable for each of us).

In -depth collection and understanding of spirits.

Old -style JBL speakers and MCintosh Amp (IYKYK).

There are also exquisite designs.

If you come to Taipei to miss this place, you miss a large part of Taipei."
"乙烯基加音響系統和飲料。
如果這聽起來像您喜歡的地方，那麼這裡就適合您。

可以從菜單上點飲料，也可以從菜單上點創意/經典雞尾酒。
（沒有圖片）從菜單上取消了 fernet sour 和 eeyores requiem，兩者都很喜歡。

還有小吃和甜點，但沒有深入研究。聽說他們很好。

確實嘗試了美國辣椒的融合方法，其中包含大塊的燉豬肉，非常嫩。想想大塊的台灣燉肉，但帶有辣椒。","Ethylene -based audio system and drink.
If this sounds like a place you like, then here is suitable for you.

You can order drinks from the menu, or you can point creative/classic cocktails from the menu.
(No picture) The Fernet Sour and EEYORES Requiem were canceled from the menu. Both like them.

There are also snacks and desserts, but there are no in -depth research.I heard that they are good.

It is really trying to fusion of American peppers, which contains large pieces of stewed pork, which is very tender.Think about the big piece of Taiwan stew, but with peppers."
"舒適
很棒的飲料
好聽的音樂
韋伯最棒！","Comfortable
Great drink
Nice music
Weber is the best!"
"氣氛很好。平衡飲料。友善的服務。
我喜歡這裡的焦糖布丁！","The atmosphere is very good.Balanced drinks.Friendly service.
