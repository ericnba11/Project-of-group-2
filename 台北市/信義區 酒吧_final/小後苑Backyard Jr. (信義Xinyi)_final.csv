"其實知道小後苑很久了
終於找到機會來體驗～
今天只有兩個人，太太和我～
所以沒辦法點太多🤭😶
加上太太是孕媽咪所以飲品只有一種無酒精的選擇
重點提醒！康普茶是發酵過的，所以是有微量酒精的，不建議孕婦飲用噢！
我們在薯條和炸雞之間猶豫了好久😆
選擇障礙～
最後，點了炸雞和虱目魚炊飯～
炸雞搭配的是特製剝皮辣椒特調醬料
太太的飲品是紅心芭樂氣泡飲搭配上層莓果泡沫（？）
我點的則是house wine～
意外的好喝～服務人員貼心提醒可以醒酒一下再喝～
沒想到！越來越好喝！最後直接點一瓶！
一杯350元一瓶1500元～
推薦大家直接點一瓶，喝不完帶回家繼續喝
回到食物的點評～
個人喜好比較偏好這道炊飯不需要有荷包蛋和魚魯😂
單純一致性的保留炊飯、吻仔魚乾以及煎的恰到好處的虱目魚和現磨山葵就行
我們剛好是被安排到吧台座位～
很幸運了，因為星期五晚上沒有先訂位～
服務人員都很好聊很熱情，就算一個人來也不會尷尬～
差點忘了黑蒜頭餛飩雞湯～
把雞肉變成餛飩
湯裡面的香菇也非常好吃
太太整碗完食😍😍😍
很多純飲的酒品～
馬上推薦給懂酒的朋友～

Focus on reminder!Kangpu tea has been fermented, so there are trace alcohol. It is not recommended to drink it!

Recommend everyone to click a bottle directly, take it home and take it home to continue drinking
Back to the review of food ~
Personal preferences prefer this cooking rice, do not need to have poached eggs and fish Lu 😂
Simply consistent retention of cooking rice, dried fish kiss, and fried milkfish and existing mountains.
We happened to be arranged to the bar seat ~
Fortunately, because there is no booking on Friday night ~
The service staff are very good and enthusiastic, even if a person comes, it will not be embarrassing ~

"服務給三🌟是覺得好像沒有感覺到什麼服務，做吧台區～就是上菜收盤子，包含酒其實也沒有多做介紹。不管是依照食物搭餐、號稱威士忌酒吧也沒有給酒單或是針對個人喜好詢問之類的

餐點口味上我覺得價格雖然高，但是細緻度和口味有做出差別度，算是不錯

沙拉就一般

薯條厚度熟度適中，份量也不少搭配醬料兩種

期待過高的剝皮辣椒醬炸雞，醬味道可以如果雞肉再切小塊或是醃製搭配醬料的口味，多點層次會更好

烤澎湖透抽，蠻喜歡的！口味新鮮而且有處理到焦香口感，不單純只是弄熟上菜，保有外皮的風味也可以吃到鮮甜

滷味，覺得一般還可以，可能會期待吃到很厲害的豆乾之類的，但是還是很花時間慢慢入味那種

炒泡麵，推薦的一道、肉品、蔥花、辣椒、溫泉蛋、配上金桔，鹹香酸甜帶有口感的泡沫一起吃很滿足

當天只有喝啤酒，可能有機會小酌吃東西配點小酒再來拜訪看看，畢竟牆上許多名氣酒款","It seems that the service does not seem to feel any service. It is a bar area ~ It is the closing of the dish. In fact, there is no more introduction to the wine.Whether it is meal in food, known as whiskey bars, it has not given wine orders or asked for personal preferences.

In terms of meals, I think that although the price is high, the details and tastes make a difference, which is good

Salad is average

The thickness of the fries is moderate, and there are many types of portion with a lot of sauces.

Looking forward to the high peel peeling chili sauce fried chicken, the sauce taste can be cut if the chicken is cut or pickled with the flavor of the sauce, it will be better.

Bake Penghu through pumping, I like it!The taste is fresh and has a sense of scorching the taste. It is not simply to get cooked. You can also eat fresh sweet flavor to keep the flavor of the outer skin.

威士忌：不僅種類十分多元，也能喝到平時較難購買到的酒款，搭配服務人員專業的介紹與服務，整體非常好的體驗

煙燻飛魚拉麵：台灣較少見的魚介湯底，搭配微酸的配料，整體口感還不錯。主菜是叉燒及干貝，跟湯底以及選用的麵條算是蠻搭的，用料也算大氣。煙燻飛魚好像是湯底的一部份不是作為主菜，乍看餐點名字會誤會，算是水準以上的一道菜

松露薯條：中規中矩而已，台北不少店家的松露薯條比這個更出色。

白酒：少見微酸不偏甜的口感，搭配餐點還不錯

服務及用餐環境：優秀，下班想放鬆來吃點東西喝兩杯來說算是不錯選擇，價格來說算是略高但還能接受","Conclusion: The shop is suitable for whiskey enthusiasts, and the level of meals is not bad. If you want to drink a cup of whiskey and you can consider when you eat something.

Whiskey: Not only is the types very diverse, but also the wine that is more difficult to buy. It is a very good experience with the professional introduction and service of the service staff. The overall experience is very good

"店家規定在店內用餐一定得點飲料，飲品沒有列在菜單上，由服務生在桌邊說明，因為這家店主打他們的威士忌收藏，調酒類的選擇很少，如果不想喝酒精類的飲料，有三款茶類飲料可以選擇：金萱氣泡飲、橙皮鐵觀音、冬瓜紅烏龍，服務生僅說明飲品口味，未說明飲品價格或容量，我後來選擇了最後一個，飲料上桌當下我愣了一下，從來沒看過單點無酒精飲料這麼小杯，以一個小小的咖啡杯盛裝，沒有任何裝飾，杯子本身已經很小了，裡面的飲料卻還只有2/3滿(目測100毫升左右)，平常只有吃西式套餐上餐前迎賓飲時才會看到這麼小杯的飲料，單點的無酒精飲料我還是頭一次看到這麼小杯的，一般人大約3-5口就喝完了，喝起來像冬瓜茶，也喝不出什麼多層次或特別的韻味… 結果結帳時看到那杯茶的價格是$350(再加一成)，老實說啦… 飲料一杯要賣$385不是不行，但我會期望一個強制顧客點飲料的餐廳花多一點心思在飲料上，一杯$385的飲料好歹上面可以插個花或弄個乾冰裝飾一下吧，不然至少也要有一點特別的材料在裡面吧，至少用水杯尺寸的杯子裝，用一個小小的咖啡杯裝個半滿的冬瓜茶，一點巧思都沒有，要收個$385真的是說不過去吧哈哈，吃過很多中價位、高價位的餐廳，從來沒有看過這麼不用心的飲料…

餐點部分以食材來說價格稍高，但考量到店家開在新光三越，座位還算寬敞，餐點的價格還算可以接受(滷肉飯$250加一成，雞湯$280加一成，松露薯條$280加一成)，食物都算到位。

考量到整體用餐感受，如果想吃精緻版的台式小吃我還是比較推薦永心鳳茶，食物水平與這家差不多，茶飲比這家好喝和用心太多了，也不會強制用餐顧客點飲料；如果要找創意料理，我覺得新光三越另外一家輪輪1976的料理比這家更有特色，價格相當，雖然輪輪也規定用餐必須點飲料，但飲料的選擇豐富許多，飲料有特色，價格也較合理。

簡短來說，如果是來品嚐平常買不到的威士忌，也許可以考慮光顧這家，如果不是為了威士忌來，那建議三思，有太多其他更好的選擇…","The store stipulates that there must be some beverages in the store. The drink is not listed on the menu. The waiter explained at the table because the owner of the shopkeeper hits their whiskey collection. There are three tea beverages to choose from: Jin Xuan gas bubble drink, orange peel iron Guanyin, winter melon red oolong, waiters only explain the taste of drinks, and did not indicate the price or capacity of the drink.

It's over, it is like winter melon tea, and I can't drink any multi -level or special charm ... As a result, the price of that cup of tea at the checkout is $ 350 (plus 10 %). To be honest ... a drink of a drink is $ 385 It's not impossible, but I will expect a restaurant that enforces customers to order drinks to spend a little bit more about the drink. A drink of $ 385 can be inserted or dried on it. Inside, install at least a cup of water cup, install a small coffee cup with a half -full winter melon tea, there is no ingenuity at all, it is really not possible to collect $ 385. The restaurant at a price has never seen such an unnecessary drink ...

The price of the meal is slightly higher in terms of ingredients, but considers the store to open Shin Kong Sanyue, the seats are quite spacious, and the price of the meal can be acceptable. The food is $ 280), and the food is in place.

Considering the overall meal experience, if I want to eat exquisite version of the tabletop snack, I still recommend Yongxinfeng tea. The food level is similar to this one. Tea is much more delicious than this one. Drinks; if you want to find creative cuisine, I think Shin Kong Sanyue's other wheel 1976 dishes are more distinctive than this. The price is equal. Although the wheel also stipulates that the meal must be ordered, the drinking choices are much rich, and the drinks have characteristics. The price is more reasonable.

詢問她酒單上1500～2000的酒，她就告知那是舊酒單，目前已經沒有銷售，一直介紹超貴的酒……
之後跟她說那我們可能點調酒就好，她馬上變臉走人。
等了一陣子終於又有服務生過來幫我們點餐，詢問新的服務生可否點酒單上1500的白酒，她馬上就回覆可以點……
所以那位nicole小姐是在騙人？
明明就有在賣的商品都跟客人告知沒有，硬希望客人點她推薦的高價酒。
要銷售推薦真的不是問題，但也請不要用欺騙人的手法好嗎？業績壓力有大到讓妳可以昧著良心？
總而言之，這是個非常不愉快的消費經驗，之後也不會再去消費。或許少一個沒有貢獻度的客人對餐廳並無損失，但真心期望這位小姐能學會尊重自己，尊重妳的工作，並且要有職業道德，不要為了業績降低自己的格調 與人品。","Four girls entered the store for consumption around 9/18 in the evening. Because I just wanted to find a place where I had a meal, I was told by the outdoor area and informed the low of $ 400 per person.
At the beginning, a female service student named Nicole was very enthusiastic (she said she was the manager). She asked her to introduce liquor, first introduce our more than 5,000 champagne, and then recommend a bottle of more than 3,000 liquor.
Asked her wine list 1500 to 2000 wine, she told that it was the old wine list, and there was no sales at present.
Then I told her that we might order bartender, and she immediately changed her face.
After waiting for a while, some waiters came over to help us order for me. Ask the new waiter if she can order 1500 liquor on the wine list, she immediately responds to order ...
So is Miss Nicole cheating?
Obviously, there are products that are selling to the guests that they are not informed of the guests, and I hope that the guests order her high -priced alcohol.
It is really not a problem to sell recommendations, but please do n’t use the trick of deception?The performance pressure is so high so that you can be conscience?

雞尾酒的品質不僅僅是令人失望，甚至可能會讓你有點惱火。點了長島和類似莫吉託的特殊菜單，但味道都不怎麼樣。另外，他們的威士忌收藏似乎很多，但錯過了一些好酒……唯一的好處可能是友善的工作人員和甜蜜的氛圍（因此兩顆星而不是一顆星。）我不會推薦給任何尋找像樣飲料的人…,"The quality of cocktails is not just disappointing, it may even make you a little annoying.Ordered Long Island and a special menu similar to Mogito, but the taste was not good.In addition, their whiskey collection seems to be many, but I missed some good wine ...

"不要來！他們得到了他們可能僱用的最糟糕的服務器。

態度太粗魯了。當她說話時，她甚至沒有看我們，沒有微笑，什麼都沒有。我們根本沒有感到受歡迎！由於我們坐在外面，天氣很熱，我姐姐還被蚊子咬了。進去一看，只有一到兩張桌子坐滿了人。有很多空桌。因此，我們禮貌地詢問服務員，如果沒有人出現，是否可以讓我們進去。她直接告訴我們，沒有辦法搬到裡面，如果我們不想坐在外面，我們應該回家，也許下次再回來。她並沒有試圖適應，而是拒絕為我們提供任何形式的適應。

餐廳客滿是完全可以理解的。如果她能以更好的態度與我們交談或至少露出微笑，我和我的家人也可以坐在外面。

台北還有很多其他地方可以提供優質的服務、美食和雞尾酒。我建議大家避開這個地方！","Don't come!They got the worst server they might hire.

If we don't want to sit outside, we should go home, maybe we will come back next time.She did not try to adapt, but refused to provide us with any form of adaptation.

如果你來這裡是為了點一瓶威士忌/蘇格蘭威士忌慢慢喝的話，那麼你就來對地方了。  其中一位女性工作人員在威士忌方面非常耐心且知識淵博。  她花時間向顧客介紹不同的品牌。  然而，如果你來這裡是為了雞尾酒和食物，那就可能是另一回事了。  食物只是公平但昂貴。  調酒師真的很花時間調製簡單的雞尾酒（JD 加可樂需要 20 分鐘）。,"If you come here to order a bottle of whiskey/Scottish whiskey, then you will come to the place.One of the female staff members was very patient and knowledgeable in terms of whiskey.She spends time to introduce different brands to customers.However, if you come here for cocktails and food, it may be another matter.Food is just fair but expensive.The bartender really takes time to prepare the simple cocktail (JD plus Cola takes 20 minutes).",False,0.022,0.0,0.978,0.1655
