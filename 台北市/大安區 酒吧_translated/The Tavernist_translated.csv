"餐廳的環境、氛圍：蠻不錯的，我是禮拜天晚上去的，人沒有很多，可以慢慢吃，跟另一半聊聊天，很適合約會！
服務：很好，用的是普遍西餐廳的服務方式，有一位專門負責我們桌的服務人員去做服務，我們是lyn 負責的，她很貼心、很會拍照、也很好聊天，會仔細介紹餐點，而且會一直留意我們的用餐情況。
食物方面：口味偏咸，餐點分量較大。有吃到特別有印象的是凱薩沙拉，裏面的醃漬鳳尾魚咸咸酸酸的，搭配蔬菜來吃很讚！蔬菜的水分很多，讓它不會太咸，鳳尾魚也能帶出蔬菜的甜味。裏面的雞肉口感比較乾，餅乾也有點受潮，不夠脆。
我們還叫了例湯—南瓜湯，喝起來沒有其他的調味，就是原食材的味道，湯很甜、很濃郁，南瓜很香，因為還有配麵包，所以我覺得我們應該叫一份就好了，因為真的真的很濃郁，所以我們人各一份真的很有飽腹感。（我們已經比一般女生會吃了…下面會放我們吃了都什麼，最後都吃完，除了兩塊威靈頓以外）
我們有訂威靈頓牛排，因為我們是為了威靈頓才去吃的，所以即使他有先告知是四人份的，我還是訂了…威靈頓牛排也是偏咸的口味，兩個人這樣吃下來，人各一件已經飽了，所以還是建議四個人去吃的時候才訂。牛排整體吃下來沒什麼特別的，就只是牛排很嫩、很好切、很軟。（剩下兩件，打包帶走，打包盒子很漂亮）
因為基本上都吃到咸的，就算吃到很飽，還是想要來個甜點，就叫了他們的「豆。花」，裏面有豆漿冰淇淋+味道像日本甜醬油的醬汁+一些季節水果，冰淇淋的豆味很濃，很好吃，加了醬汁，醬汁本身的咸味好像沒有了，有帶出一點點豆漿冰淇淋的甜味，季節水果有讓我嚇到，西瓜小小一顆，我們本來都以為會沒什麼水份的，可是它一口下去，爆汁！而且還很甜！
最後這家餐廳，建議約會、節日慶祝的時候去吃，服務做的很好，環境很舒服，我的話下次還會考慮去吃，可是就不會再點威靈頓牛排了。","The environment and atmosphere of the restaurant: It's pretty good. I went to the evening of the night. There are not many people. I can eat slowly and chat with the other half. It is very suitable for dating!
Service: Very good, the service method of general western restaurants is used. There is a service staff who is responsible for our desk to do the service. We are responsible for LYN. Meals, and we will always pay attention to our meals.
In terms of food: The taste is salty, and the meal is divided.What is particularly impressive is Caesar salad, the pickled phoenix fish inside is salty and sour. It is great to eat with vegetables!There are a lot of vegetables in vegetables, so that it will not be too salty, and phoenix fish can also bring out the sweetness of vegetables.The chicken inside is relatively dry, and the biscuits are a bit moisture, not crispy enough.
We also called the example of the soup -pumpkin soup. There is no other seasoning when it is drinking, that is, the taste of the original ingredients. The soup is very sweet and rich. The pumpkin is very fragrant, because there is a bread of bread, so I think we should call a copy. Because it is really rich, we have a sense of fullness.(We have already eaten than ordinary girls ... Let us eat what we eat, and finally finish eating, except two pieces of Wellington)
We have a predestine steak, because we only eat for Wellington, so even if he has a four -person, I still booked ... Wellington steak is also a salty flavor. Two people are like this. After eating, one person is full, so it is recommended to order it when four people go to eat.There is nothing special to eat the steak as a whole, just the steak is very tender, very good, and soft.(Two left, packing and taking away, the packing box is beautiful)
Because basically they are salty, even if they are full, they still want to have a dessert, so they call their ""beans. Flower"". There are soy milk ice cream+flavor like Japanese sweet soy sauce sauce+some seasonal fruits , Ice cream's beans are very strong, delicious, add sauce, the salty taste of the sauce itself seems to be gone, there is a sweet taste of bringing a little soy milk ice cream, seasonal fruit scare me, watermelon is a small one One, we thought there would be no water, but it went down and burst into juice!And it's very sweet!
In the end, this restaurant is recommended to eat during dating and festivals. The service is very good and the environment is very comfortable. I will consider eating next time, but I wo n’t order the Verxon steak.",False

位於鬧中取靜的東區一隅，享受美食與美感並陳，將食材與視覺作最具審美的結合！當然色、香、味俱全是必要的；惟在人員服務上差強人意，如果能有主廚交流會更盡興！食材與味覺體驗部分，這米其林二星絕對值得！,"It is located in the Eastern District, which is located in the noisy, enjoy food and beauty, and make the most aesthetic combination of ingredients with vision!Of course, color, fragrance and taste are all necessary; but the personnel services are unsatisfactory, if chef can communicate more!For the ingredients and taste experience, this Michelin two -star is definitely worth it!",False

"金普頓酒店裡的餐廳，帶著🐶入住，允許🐶進入餐廳和主人一起用餐，很好的體驗。帶上我們，今晚三桌帶著🐶，好有愛的

覺得Set Menu分量有點大，於是單點
透抽河粉：透抽做成河粉的形狀，用熱湯燙熟，清淡鮮美

香料花椰菜: 燒烤的花椰菜配土豆泥，土豆泥非常細膩潤滑

燒烤石斑魚：估計石斑魚的關係，肉質有點老

脆皮豬五花+舒活里肌肉：這道菜是最後加點的，看到別桌上忍不住加的，個人認為是今晚最好吃的，五花肉層次豐富，舒活里肌肉肉質很嫩，配了鳳梨薄片和鳳梨醬，味道搭配層次分明

慢燉手撕牛小排塔可：最後上的一道，有點吃不動了，全熟的牛排和手撕牛肉，搭配三種醬料和薄餅

雞尾酒單很喜歡，點了馬告和紫蘇，特別喜歡馬告的味道

服務的小姊姊好親切，熱情地和我們介紹餐點和廚師。

很完美的晚餐","The restaurant in the Ginpton Hotel takes a check -in, allowing 🐶 to enter the restaurant to dine with the owner, and experience a good experience.Bring us, with three tables tonight, so loving

Through the pink powder: The shape of the river powder is made into the shape of the river powder, and it is cooked with hot soup, light and delicious

Fast cauliflower: grilled cauliflower with potato puree, potato puree is very delicate and lubricated

Barbecue grouper: It is estimated that the relationship between grouper fish is a bit old

Crispy pig pentagram+Shuhuoli muscle: This dish is finally added. I can't help but see it. I personally think it is the best tonight. The pork belly is rich in layers. Tender, with pineapple slices and pineapple sauce, the taste is clearly layered

Slowly stew the hand tore the beef steak tower: the last one, a bit unable to eat, the cooked steak and hand tore beef, with three kinds of sauces and pancakes

1.兩道沙拉都很好吃，有層次感。
2.烤豬五花，有兩種肉，嫩的很嫩有碳香，脆的部分皮很酥但下層油脂有點多。搭配醃漬鳳梨有點特別和記憶點。
3.碳烤石斑魚，用南瓜包裹石斑，有不太一樣的體驗
4.威靈頓牛排，要先預定，裡面的牛菲力非常非常嫩，好像在吃牛舌哪種口感。但菇類味道過重，若一起吃，不會提味，反而蓋掉了肉的鮮美。沾醬過鹹，一樣沒有提味作用。
5.調酒類，都有一點視覺衝擊，但喝起來普通
6.甜點，什麼阿拉斯加的，芋頭加海綿蛋糕加上糖霜，冰冰熱熱，軟軟脆脆，口感衝擊還不錯。

整體來說氛圍很棒，餐點有一定水準，但又覺得有點這麼可惜。","The location is very comfortable as a whole, and the atmosphere is great.

1. Both salads are delicious and have a sense of layering.

3. Carbon grilled grilled grouper, wrap the grouper with pumpkin, have different experiences
4. Wellington steak, you need to book first. The beef Liili inside is very very tender, as if you are eating the taste of beef tongue.But the mushrooms are too heavy. If you eat it together, you will not taste it, but you will cover the deliciousness of the meat.The dipping sauce is too salty, and there is no taste effect.
5. Blooming, there are a little visual impact, but it is ordinary to drink

"這一次五個人聚餐，應該算是很慘烈的一次用餐經驗。

炸魚薯條、脆皮豬五花、肋眼牛排，讓我們幾個人無法給予任何評價，炸魚薯條的魚之巨大（請看圖）讓我們無法理解這道菜的美味之處；肋眼本身就有鹹度，沒有什麼獨特之處；豬五花的肥沃，讓大部分的人直接放棄肥肉部分。

甜點的部分，搭配的調酒combo不是一起上的，馬卡龍等了很久才上桌但沒有退冰完全，而且內餡夾的只是鮮奶油；草莓鮮奶油杯的草莓很雞肋，可麗露、軟糖，咬了一口就放棄他們。

調酒的部分，大家輪流喝一口就放棄；咖啡的部分，雖然都有喝完但走出去之後，大家有再繼續討論，拿鐵真苦。

好吃的是巧克力舒芙蕾（不包含搭配的薄荷冰淇淋）、米形麵、軟殼蟹（雖然巨大的盤子只有一支隻），但不足以讓我們再來一次。

上餐速度偏慢、五人消費金額9500左右。","This time, five people's dinner should be considered a tragic dining experience.

Fried fish and potato strips, crispy pig pork flowers, rib eye steak, so that some of us cannot give any evaluation, the huge fish of fried fish and potato strips (please look at the picture) make us unable to understand the deliciousness of this dish; the ribs The eyes itself has saltiness, and there is nothing unique; the fertile of the pork flowers allows most people to give up the fat part directly.

In the dessert part, the bartending Combo is not put together. Macaron waited for a long time before it was served on the table, but it was not completely degraded, and the stuffing was only fresh cream. , Fud sugar, take a bite and give up them.

For the bartending part, everyone takes a take turns to give up; although the coffee parts, although they have finished drinking, after going out, everyone will continue to discuss, latte is really bitter.

The delicious one is chocolate Shullele (excluding mint ice cream), rice -shaped noodles, and soft shell crabs (although there is only one huge plate), but it is not enough to let us come again.

"過年家庭聚餐因為有攜帶寵物跟嬰兒的關係，所以選了這間寵物友善的Tavernist飯店餐廳首次造訪，但實際用餐體驗跟期待落差滿大的… 我們一共六大一小加一隻狗，所以座位區被安排是在電梯出來的入口處（看起來像候位區的沙發加矮桌）感覺就不是很好，這個區域也就感受不到店內用心佈置的主題裝飾了 很可惜。
餐點的部分擺盤用心、烹調的口味都不錯，牛排很好吃，不過以這個價位加上是米其林餐盤推薦來說還是略顯普通。
服務人員態度很好，因為要沖泡嬰兒的奶粉，也貼心提供冷熱水。
總結來說，適合朋友跟情侶用餐，攜帶寵物跟嬰幼兒的話比較難享受到該價位餐廳的用餐品質。","Because the New Year's family dinner is related to the relationship between pets and babies, I chose this pet -friendly TAVERNIST restaurant and restaurant for the first time, but the actual dining experience and expectations are full of gaps ...

"以這種號稱高級餐廳，竟然能端得出這麼糟糕的麵包、沙拉，還滿不可思議。附湯的麵包有明顯的油耗味，非常怪異，感覺很不新鮮，跟其他高級餐廳的麵包差異甚遠。沙拉裡面的應該是烤培根明顯的油耗味，同樣非常不新鮮，吃下去簡直要很費力。

主菜春雞還算有一定水準，配的醬料滿有特色。另一道烤牛肉，雖然肉質不甚佳，由於醬料有很多種，配起來也還算可以。

本來應該給兩顆星，但是因為後來的甜點實在太差勁，所謂開心果巧克力480，結果只有一小坨，旁邊散著四小坨莫名的麵包，同樣不是很新鮮，不論口感和擺盤都讓人驚詫，這480花得也太不值了！

另外，服務的人員有些實在滿不專業，介紹菜介紹得哩哩拉拉，應該是新來的。話說現在餐館人員難找，大概也不能太苛求吧！

這種菜色，難怪雖然有上米其林餐盤，但是整個中午偌大館內只有兩桌客人⋯","This is known as a high -end restaurant, and it can come to such a bad bread and salad, which is still incredible.The bread of the soup has obvious fuel consumption. It is very weird and feels very fresh, which is far from the bread of other high -end restaurants.The salad should be the obvious fuel consumption of the baking bacon, which is also very not new. It is very laborious to eat it.

The main cuisine spring chicken has a certain level, and the sauce is full of characteristics.The other grilled beef, although the meat is not very good, because there are many kinds of sauce, it is okay to match.

It should have been given two stars, but because the later desserts are too bad. The so -called happy chocolate 480, the result is only a small cricket, there are four small crickets beside it, which is not very fresh. People are shocked, this 480 is too worthless!

In addition, the service personnel are really unprofessional, and the introduction of the dishes is introduced. It should be new.By the way, it is difficult for restaurants to find it, and it is probably not too demanding!

服務生雖然都蠻熱情，但因為現場有外國朋友，服務生的英語能力還是有待加強，感覺只能用最基本的表達介紹餐點給外國朋友，無法將一些詳細主廚想傳達的概念表達出來， 蠻可惜的。","This restaurant has been collected since the opening, and I have time to go recently. It was the Moroccan package period, but the overall was disappointed;

"首先，因為餐廳在金普頓飯店的12樓，所以地下室有停車場很方便，用餐可抵3小時。
餐點方面，整體來說本次點的項目都沒有雷的，口感都非常的好，餐點也很美味，價位帶覺得還算合理。
用餐氛圍，裝潢跟氣氛都很好，廁所乾淨整潔，就是數量少了一些些。服務人員，整體來說都還算可以，但是在說明上的音量真的很小聲……。

這是一間結合各國的創意料理，會讓人每樣餐點都想來一份，如果時間上允許，下午時段其實比較優惠喔。
補充：我們大約10天前訂位，同時也想預訂威靈頓牛排，可惜服務人員說已經訂完了，所以說明上寫三天前預訂是不夠的喔，可能要更早才有機會。所以本次是改點 夏布里昂牛排，超級好吃😎👍。","First of all, because the restaurant is on the 12th floor of the Ginpton Hotel, there is a parking lot in the basement. It is very convenient to have a meal for 3 hours.

女兒前幾天事先打電話跟The Tavernist餐廳預訂了兩客晚間套餐和一份威靈頓牛排，今天我們一家三口到餐廳直接被帶位到最裡面一個空調不冷、桌子沒鋪桌巾、裝潢氣氛跟外面那區有天壤之別的奇怪空間，而且一進去還遇到工作人員正在用餐，大家都很傻眼，接著我們問服務生可以坐外面那區嗎？服務生說因為外面那區是點套餐才能坐的，我說我們三人點了兩客套餐和一份威靈頓牛排還不能坐外面嗎？接著請來一位主管級服務生一樣堅持沒有三人都點套餐就是只能歸類為單點就要被安排在這個感覺被歧視的空間，那為什麼電話預訂餐沒先告知，更何況一客套餐才2880元，一份威靈頓牛排3280元比套餐貴，這是什麼道理啊！我說那我們是不是直接換三客套餐才對呢？這位主管不讓我們換但又很勉強幫我們換位子也是換到另一個暗暗面對廚房那個六人桌，後來又發現晚上唯一的六人桌有人訂位，才又很勉強的讓我們換到那個正常區，結果整個晚上到快九點還有好幾桌沒坐滿！結帳超過一萬元，排除座位的事，餐點的CP值也不高，尤其威靈頓牛排不知道為什麼要這麼鹹，還有套餐的每一道餐點也令人失望！,"A few days ago, my daughter called and the TAVERNIST restaurant a few days ago to book a two -guest evening package and a Verinen steak.

"先說結論，氣氛不錯但服務細節疏失不少，本季菜單為墨西哥風格，以價位來說稍嫌平淡了些。

餐廳位於飯店十二樓，電梯一進來完全沒有接待人員有點錯愕。本季墨西哥風味菜單原本期待吃到更多的驚喜，但從開場石頭湯後，驚喜一道一道的遞減。石頭湯的時候建議可以挑過形狀，圓形的可以露出湯面也不會卡住湯匙，湯本身味道很不錯。比目魚的玉米咖啡醬配jalapeño 辣油很配，接下來三道肉類都是類似的方式呈現就很疲乏了，都是木盒容器配上現烤tortilla，若是能搭配不同的脆餅或是飯會更有變化。調酒的部分pairing前兩杯雖然特別且帶有墨國風格，但與對應的餐點並不是那麽相配，而且第二杯漏上到下一道菜才來，雖然事後整個pairing都贈送還是略顯可惜，第三杯濃厚的高粱加過甜的烏梅真的不好入口… 最後churros 有附上五種醬料算是精緻且特別。

服務的部分有個小地方可以更好，一位人員上餐時已經抱著木盒了，沒有其餘的手可以清開桌面，此時只能客人自己協助，若外場人手增加可以避免。

有兩點美中不足之處
1. 咖哩魚的醬汁是soup但卻沒有湯匙可以吃盡，味道鮮美，實在可惜。
2. 我的羊排脂肪比例過多，滿影響口感的，其實滿想把一塊油脂吐出來，但實在太難看😅

"慶生大餐，由於之前有抽到大安金普頓飯店的The Tavernist餐廳價值1800+10%的和牛招待券，所以選擇來這邊享用午餐。

我們這次選擇了午間輕套餐，只是沒想到它真的很輕…兩位用餐的價格是1960+10%，水資130+10%則是另外計算。

第一道上來的是肆豆培根沙拉，這道前菜的表現不過不失，其份量是所有餐點中最大的一道…

第二道是我不吃的炭烤透抽(所以我沒拍)，但我有吃一塊嚐味，我覺得跟夜市賣的烤魷魚有87分像。

第三道前菜選擇了手工里卡達起司—蜂蜜蒜味油醋—酸麵包，我必須說這道的手工里卡達起司意外的令人食指大動讓人忍不住一口接一口的沾取麵包食用，真的非常棒！而服務生可能也觀察到我們的讚不絕口，親切與積極的上來詢問：

「請問要不要續麵包呢？」

「當然好啊！」

智慧的我在兩秒後頓時警覺起來…

「…請等一下」

「嗯？」

「續麵包要加錢嗎？」

「要的喔！」

X的，你剛剛沒有說啊！！接著立刻婉拒服務生的「親切」服務，欸，要加錢應該要先說吧！？

第四道是我們的主菜，豬五花—豬里肌—焦糖鳳梨醬汁。豬里肌的部分極棒，應該是近期吃到最好吃的主餐肉品，豬五花的部分則讓我反差很大，皮弄成硬到連刀叉都不一定可以順利切下的硬度是不是真的好的料理手法我覺得有待商榷…而咬下的口感與里肌的水準更是差異極大，如果是這個份量的話，你能不能考慮給我4塊里肌，我應該會比較開心。

對了，這一塊肉的直徑大小大概不會比50元硬幣大多少…

第五道是我期待已久，也是期望最深的和牛臀肉，只是期望越深，失望越大。份量不大這件事暫且不提，我知道高價的肉品就是昂貴，但這道的問題是這肉排完全沒有和牛該有的豐富滋味，到底是什麼等級的澳洲和牛？可以吃起來跟我前晚吃的夏慕尼菲力差不多？你單點的價格是人家套餐的一倍欸？七種香料鹽也是虛有其表，不想一一仔細評論，你直接給我玫瑰鹽或是海鹽都可能讓牛肉更好吃。

雖然是抽到的，但我去看google評論完全沒有人分享這一道的照片，我是覺得規劃菜單的人應該想想為什麼。

最後一道甜點很有趣，請主廚來你面前表演，然後問是誰生日，得到答案後，夾給了我一塊生日banner，瀟灑的轉身閃人。你能感覺到那種例行公事的Fu，這點我不怪他，畢竟就是個工作。但我只想說這家餐廳的經營者對於這種事情不夠在乎，那就不應該把這件事當作一個桌前服務，你乾脆都不要做會比較好。

結論，驚喜有餘，再訪不足。","The celebration meal, because the TAVERNIST restaurant at the Daan Jinspton Hotel was worth 1800+10%of the Whemiu Enrollment Coupon, so I chose to come here to enjoy the lunch here.

We chose the lunch light set meal this time, but we didn't expect it to be really light ... The price of the two meals was 1960+10%, and 130+10%of water assets were calculated.

The first thing to come up is the Slang Bacon Salad. The performance of this front dish is not lost. The amount of its portion is the largest of all meals ...

The second is the charcoal grilled soy sauce I do n’t eat (so I did n’t shoot), but I had a taste of taste. I think there are 87 points of grilled squid sold by the night market.

The third front dish chose a handmade Cada cheese -honey garlic oil vinegar -acid bread. I have to say that this handmade Licada cheese unexpectedly moved the index finger. It is really great to eat bread!The waiter may also observe our praise, cordially and positively ask:

""Do you want to renew the bread?""

""Of course, okay!""

Wisdom, I immediately became alert after two seconds ...

""... please wait""

""Um?""

""Do you want to add money for renewal?""

""Well!""

X, you didn't say it!IntersectionThen immediately refuse the ""kind"" service of the waiter, alas, you should say first!Intersection

The fourth is our main dish, pig penta -pig muscle -caramel pineapple sauce.The part of the pig's muscle is great. It should be the best main meal meat in the near future. The part of the pork five flowers makes me very contrast. Whether the hardness is really good cooking technique, I think it is yet to be questioned ... and the taste of the bite is very different from the level of the muscle. If this is the amount, can you consider giving me 4 muscles. Happy.

By the way, the diameter of this piece of meat will not be more than 50 yuan coins ...

The fifth way is that I have been looking forward to it for a long time, and the deepest hip buttocks, but the deeper the expectations, the greater the disappointment.Not mentioned for the time being, I know that high -priced meat is expensive, but the problem is that this steak is not rich in the taste of cows. What level of Australian and cows are it?Can you eat almost the same as the Xiameini I ate last night?Your single -order price is doubled for others?Seven kinds of spice salt are also virtual. I don't want to comment one by one. You can give me rose salt or sea salt directly to make the beef better.

Although it was drawn, I went to see the Google comment that no one shared this photo at all. I think the person who planned the menu should think about why.

The last dessert is very interesting. Please ask the chef to perform in front of you, and then ask who is the birthday. After getting the answer, I gave me a birthday Banner and turned to the flash.You can feel that kind of routine FU, I don't blame him, after all, it is a job.But I just want to say that the operator of this restaurant does not care enough about this kind of thing, then you should not take this matter as a table service. You should simply do not do it.

Conclusion, there are more surprises and insufficient visits.",False
餐廳氛圍漂亮，服務人員親切和善，不論是接聽電話或現場服務，有一位小姐笑容可掬，感受到賓至如歸，內部氛圍很適合拍照，有別於一般餐廳，走的是古典風格，亮眼出色，第一道鮭魚非常驚艷，粉紅胡椒的香氣十足，加上飽和的顏色、剛好的份量灑在鮭魚上面，整體搭配起來100分！第二道豌豆濃湯稍微份量有點多，喝到最後會小小的膩，但培根煎的很香，所以這道料理大概80分～主食的部分酥皮雞肉，我覺得酥皮的部分很厲害，但肉品稍微普通，沒有很跳出來，但旁邊的千層馬鈴薯派有夠好吃😂酥脆可口，如果沒聽錯，服務生應該是說用鴨油煎鍋～所以最後分數拉回來80分！最後的甜點，舒芙蕾皮很棒，下面內餡偏甜，但薄荷冰淇淋之厲害的，一吃下口仿佛聞到薄荷葉被揉碎的清香四溢，感覺到香味在舌尖跳舞，心情都輕快愉悅起來，這道菜色也給90分👍結帳時的帳單和收據夾超有質感，值得再來。,"The restaurant's atmosphere is beautiful and the service staff is kind and kind.

If it is not listened, the waiter should use duck frying pan ~ So the final score was pulled back 80 points.

餐點口味符合價格期待，廚師會出來熱情解說每一道菜的用料及食材值得讚許，吃得很滿足。但美中不足的是，酒水點餐服務引導並未站在客人角度跟對餐廳的了解（是否第一次前來）給予建議，而是以營業客單提升面，直接給予選擇題（但未先提醒飲水的收費方式及價格），也未說明若非要飲酒是否有更好的選擇，不夠貼心透明，以致結帳時讓顧客有心理期待落差，不是完美的Happy ending 深感可惜，建議這部分可調整改進，將可讓顧客對於餐廳有更多好感，而不會因為一個點餐引導造成期待落差，壞了整間餐廳的水準及餐點的美意，更壞了顧客原先對餐點的認同感。,"The taste of the meal is in line with price expectations. The chef will come up with enthusiastic explanation of the ingredients and ingredients of each dish.However, the disadvantage of the United States is that the drinking service guidance of the drinking service did not stand on the perspective of the guest to give a suggestion to the restaurant (whether the first time he came), but to increase the market for the business customer list.

而印度冰淇淋他們將他們急速冷凍並在前端沾上一點綠豆蔻（還是是甜茴香？）

Personally, I think that the performance is quite satisfactory, and the impressive dishes are charcoal grilled pumping and broccoli scallops.
The soy sauce uses its own sweetness, and the aroma of burning makes people deep in it. The soft and tender taste is slightly salty, which is loved!Cauliflower scallops are the essence of the day. The fried scallops itself is just right, but what makes people really amazing is that broccoli side dishes, sauce and mousse. The three different presents from taste, taste to aroma are different levels. The special salty taste, the sweetness of the broccoli is out, and it is fast!

"2022/3/24 二訪午餐

很少遇到這樣的狀況
甜點的表現比主餐好上不少層次
我在The Tavernist午餐遇到了

前菜的煙燻鮭魚本身油脂豐厚
下面的蒔蘿美乃滋增添油膩感
覺得換別的醬會更合我胃口
不過這部分是個人習慣問題
喜好因人而異

豌豆濃湯口感細緻、香氣豐郁
但培根似乎放比較多
導致喝到最後培根的鹽分融入湯裡
越後面越鹹
也許湯的鹽分與培根可以全盤考量比例與份量
培根可以多，但湯的鹽分可以酌減

主餐上桌後
給人一種豐盛的滿足感
雞肉非常大份
不過這也是道配角比主角搶眼的料理
鴨油香煎的千層馬鈴薯塔非常美味
不油不膩爽口酥脆
但雞肉的部分口感不均衡
可能是熟度控制的問題
有些部份的肉質Ok
但有些吃起來粉粉接近柴掉
同時雞肉有一些腥味
也許可以用香料或酒先去腥再烤？

最後的甜點上桌前我沒有太大的期待
原因如同上次造訪提到的
不過嚐一口馬上驚為天人
高純度的可可舒芙蕾
外皮薄脆、內餡綿密順口
佐以鮮奶薄荷葉冰淇淋一起享用
薄荷的馨香讓巧克力的厚重都昇華了
這裡的甜點真的有進步

很期待The Tavernist能推出更多甜點
也許下午茶時段會很吸引人？

#thetavernist
#金普頓大安酒店

__________________
金普頓樓上的餐廳
份量真的不少
整個套餐以九種香料為靈感發想
分別是：
肉桂、孜然、茴香、杜松子，
粉紅胡椒、黑芥末、香菜籽，
草果與甘草。

食用時並不是每種香料都熟悉的人，可能不是每道料理都能明顯吃出香料味。例如透抽與茴香家族，採用茴香頭、茴香葉、茴香泥、茴香籽四重奏。是需要細細品嚐才能吃出風味，我狼吞虎嚥就沒感受到什麼特別之處。

今夜亮點有：
孜然酸麵包、黑芥末瑪莎拉軟殼蟹

麵包份量很足，外皮極酥脆，麵包本體口感極佳，溫溫熱熱咬感Q彈。咀嚼後飄出淡淡發酵酸味及孜然香，非常迷人。

軟殼蟹過去也看過不少與咖哩醬一起上桌的做法，但這裡採用的是咖哩粉末襯底。先切下螃蟹，再沾一點美乃滋，然後裹上滿滿咖哩粉。這種吃法我反而更喜歡，有種玩沙的樂趣

最後的甜點有點可惜，甜度太高了，本想使用草果的苦壓制巧克力布朗尼的甜，但太甜壓不住。 不然口感豐富、甘草甜味有別於砂糖，是很有創意的想法。

這家餐廳整體而言是服務很好，餐點不是樣樣美味(例如友人說他的生牛肉蠻可怕的) ，但具有亮點的選擇。下次會想試試看早餐，希望還有機會到訪大安金普頓，再順便上來吃個飯。

#thetavernist","2022/3/24 Two Visit Lunch

Rarely encounter such a situation
The performance of desserts is better than the main meal
I met at The TAVERNIST lunch

The smoked salmon of the predecessor's oil is rich in oil
Below the Luo Luomi Naizi increases greasy
I feel that changing the sauce will be more in my stomach
But this part is a personal habit problem
Hobbish varies from person to person

Pea thick soup has a delicate taste, rich aroma
But Bacon seems to be placed more
As a result, the salt of the last bacon was integrated into the soup
The more salty behind
Perhaps the salt and bacon of the soup can consider the proportion and the amount
There are many bacon, but the salt of the soup can be reduced as appropriate

After the main meal is served
Give people a rich sense of satisfaction
Chicken is very big
But this is also a dish that the supporting role is more eye -catching than the protagonist
The thousand -layer potato tower of duck oil fried is very delicious
Not oily nor greasy, refreshing and crispy
But the taste of some chickens is uneven
It may be a problem of cookedness control
Some parts of meat OK
But some taste the powder close to the firewood
At the same time, chicken has some fishy smell
Maybe you can use spices or wine to fish first?

I didn't expect much before the dessert on the table
The reason is as mentioned in the last visit
But you will be shocked as heaven and man immediately
High -purity Cocoa Shullele
The skin is crispy and the filling is dense
Enjoy with fresh milk mint leaf ice cream
The fragrance of mint has sublimated the thickness of chocolate
The desserts here really have improved

I look forward to the launch of more desserts for The TAVERNIST
Maybe afternoon tea time is attractive?

___________________
The restaurant upstairs upstairs
There are really a lot of portion
The whole package is inspired by nine spices
Between:
Cinnamon, cumin, fennel, Du Songzi,
Pink pepper, black mustard, coriander seeds,
Grass fruit and licorice.

When consumed, not everyone is familiar with every kind of spice, maybe not every dish can obviously eat the flavor of spices.For example, the fennel family, fennel head, fennel leaves, fennel mud, and fennel seeds.It is necessary to taste it carefully to eat the flavor. I gobbled and didn't feel anything special.

The highlights of tonight are:
Cumin sour bread, black mustard Masela soft shell crab

The bread is sufficient, the outer skin is very crispy, the bread is very good, and the warm and hot bitter bites.After chewing, the sour sour and cumin fragrance floats out, which is very charming.

The soft shell crab has also seen a lot of methods to serve with curry sauce in the past, but the curry powder base is used here.Cut the crab first, then stick a little Mei Gui, and then wrap it with curry powder.I prefer this way of eating.

The last dessert is a pity. The sweetness is too high. I wanted to use the bitter chocolate Brownney of the grass fruit, but it was too sweet to press.Otherwise, the taste of richness and licorice sweetness are different from sugar, which is a very creative idea.

This restaurant is a good service as a whole. The meal is not delicious (for example, a friend said that his raw beef is terrible), but it has a highlight of the point.I would like to try breakfast next time. I hope there will be the opportunity to visit Daan Jinspton, and then come up for a meal by the way.

﻿
在金普頓酒店12樓的The Tavernist，算是我近期吃到非常驚豔的餐廳了!﻿
午間套餐只有少少的四道菜，但卻做到極致，無論是視覺、感官、服務、口感都值得給予五顆星的評價。﻿
﻿
➰午間套餐$4-5 Courses $1,480 +10% ﻿
﻿
✔️番茄&佛卡夏﻿
由新鮮番茄搭配油漬番茄組成，搭配Ricotta cheese抹醬，和自製溫熱佛卡夏搭配，竟完美協調，每吃下一口都充滿驚喜🥳﻿
﻿
✔️干貝&南瓜﻿
本身不愛南瓜，但這絕對是我喝過最好喝的一道南瓜濃湯了🤤超級濃郁絲滑的口感喝的到南瓜的香甜，把她自己的優點發揮的淋漓盡致😍中間橫躺著一大顆生食級香煎干貝對我而言倒有點多餘🤣﻿
﻿
友人不吃海鮮，餐廳特地為她換上一道白花椰濃湯，同樣的絲滑口感有夠好喝，真的非常敬佩廚師的用心🥰﻿
﻿
✔️威靈頓牛排﻿
完全是衝著他來的呀🥺完美的五分熟菲力鋪上炒菇醬以及生火腿外層再裹上酥皮烘烤而成，真的是一道超級費工的料理，牛肉的生熟度非常剛好，超級軟嫩!酥皮也酥脆的恰到好處，搭配醬汁的鹹香真的很過癮😋﻿
也要特別稱讚牛排配菜的奶油菠菜跟馬鈴薯泥也是升天的好吃~~💕﻿
﻿
🔎為什麼是威靈頓牛排?﻿
「美味食物的集合名詞」﻿
相傳英國威靈頓公爵滑鐵盧戰役打敗拿破崙之後，他的御廚特地將他愛吃的菲力、鵝肝、松露等食材，用酥皮包起來，讓凱旋歸來的公爵可以一次就享用到他最愛的食物，久而久之，大家就稱這道菜為威靈頓牛排🥩﻿
﻿
✔️蘋果塔﻿
使用青蘋果與肉桂做成的酸甜滋味放在自製餅皮上，搭配香草醬可以說是今天饗宴上最完美的結尾了🥳﻿
-﻿
僅僅四道菜就可以完美的打動人心，服務人員也是一等一的優秀細心，友人說願意付$2500吃這頓飯 哈哈哈😂﻿
這邊的餐點是季節性的固定菜單，不知道什麼時候會換，想要吃威靈頓牛排的人最近不要錯過了~﻿
我也開始期待下次的菜單又會帶給我什麼樣的驚喜，希望之後不要太難訂位呀😋﻿

The TEVERNIST on the 12th floor of the Ginpon Hotel is a very stunning restaurant I have recently ate!
There are only four dishes of the lunch set meal, but it is the ultimate. Both vision, sensory, service, and taste are worthy of five stars.﻿
﻿
$Onon package $ 4-5 Courses $ 1,480 +10%
﻿
️ Tomato & Fka Xia
It consists of fresh tomatoes with oil -stained tomato, with Ricotta Cheese sauce, and homemade warm Buddha Katham, which is perfectly coordinated.
﻿
瓜️ Dry scallops & pumpkin
I do n’t love pumpkin, but this is definitely the best pumpkin soup I have ever drank. I ’m the sweetness of the super strong and silky taste. A raw food -grade pan -fried scalloper is a bit extra for me.
﻿
Friends do n’t eat seafood, the restaurant specially replaced her with a white coconut soup. The same silky taste is delicious enough, and I really admire the chef
﻿
排️ Wellington steak
It ’s all for him. The perfect five -point mature mushroom sauce and the outer layer of the raw ham are baked. It is really a super -consumed dish. The degree is very good, super soft and tender! The meringue is also crispy just right, the salty aroma with the sauce is really enjoyable 😋
It is also necessary to praise the cream spinach and potato puree of the steak -soor -scholacana.
﻿
牛 Why is the Verxon steak?
""Collection of delicious food""
According to legend, after the Battle of Wellington Duke Waterloo defeated Napoleon, his kitchen specially wrapped the ingredients such as Feili, foie gras, truffles and other ingredients he loved to eat, so that the Duke of Triumph returned can enjoy his favorite at one time. Food, over time, everyone calls this dish as a Verity steak
﻿
✔️ Apple Tower
The sweet and sour taste made of green apples and cinnamon is placed on the homemade cake skin. It can be said to be the most perfect ending at the feast today.
-﻿
Just four dishes can be perfectly moved, and the service staff is also an excellent and careful attentive. Friends say they are willing to pay $ 2500 to eat this meal hahaha 😂
The meal here is a seasonal fixed menu. I don’t know when it will change.
I also start looking forward to what kind of surprise I will bring to me next time.

"周六晚上和同事約好金普頓飯店12樓的Tavernist享用晚餐，雖然餐廳位在熱鬧的忠孝東路巷內，但一進飯店沁涼如水的氛圍讓心情立刻沉靜下來…..搭乘電梯到最高的12樓，彷彿又進入了另一個空間….
主用餐區頭頂上有碩大的球形環狀燈，放在裸露線路的天花板下，搭配鐵灰的線路及深綠色的牆面跟大面的落地窗，放大景深並增加通透感。桌子的放置給各桌足夠的空間，中間方桌也很能隨人數增減隨時應變帶。開放式廚房前有一張大長桌，可以清楚的看到廚房中忙忙碌碌的人。

【酸麵包】自製酸麵包搭配上發酵奶油，手工麵包外面酥硬內裡柔軟，將奶油抹在麵包上送入口中，有麵粉香氣卻無厚重感。
【黑鱈魚與小黃瓜】鱈魚和鮮奶油打發做成的魚慕斯搭配刨成三種風味小黃瓜，滑順中帶著無比的清爽，蒔蘿典雅溫和的香氣，更平衡口中的味道。
【牛奶與蜂蜜】軟綿的Riccotta Cheese ，松子冰淇淋如預期中的帶著烘烤過的堅果香，細細的乳黃色粉末是急速冷凍過的mozzarella Cheese製成的雪花冰，隱藏在內的是廚房自製的蜂蜜果凍，上桌時服務生交代千萬不要攪拌，先分開品嘗各自的味道，再兩兩吃，再混和著吃，各種搭配有著無數不同口感的變化與味道的堆疊有著絕妙的平衡。
【透抽煎茶】consommé ，法式澄清雞湯做法，之後加入肉末和蛋白煮滾後去除雜質。 倒入放置透抽薄片和薑絲的小杯中等15-20秒即可享用。茶湯很鮮美，透抽若伴隨薑絲一起咀嚼可以壓制一絲海鮮特有的味道，若無薑絲，可能會是敗筆，這道湯品個人覺得頗走鋼索。
【蘿蔔糕】自製台式蘿蔔糕做成細緻的圓塊造型，不細看會以為是西式的香酥海鮮餅搭配水波蛋一起上桌。蘿蔔糕的外皮金黃酥香、內裡還能吃到鮮甜的蘿蔔絲，台味100%。一旁佐料將蝦仁丁、臘腸、櫻花蝦、醃蘿蔔以XO醬炒香，搭配蘿蔔糕品嚐香鹹夠味，舀起一塊蘿蔔糕，再劃破水波蛋沾佐蛋汁，口感更加絲滑、豐潤。佐料中的醃蘿蔔丁與蛋白堪稱最佳配角，提供清爽微酸的清口感受。
【帶骨牛肉&甜薯&蜂蜜大蒜】帶骨牛肉外皮煎酥脆，牛肉口感確像滷肉一般柔軟，刀未用力切下就成絲塊分離，紅薯與醃漬過的大蒜做為佐料搭配，說不出這樣的搭配是否完美，但較喜愛多汁牛肉口感的我，對這道並不十分印象完美。

跟我一樣不喜歡紅白酒的人，餐廳的調酒倒是值得一點，以Gin為基底的調酒清爽順口，與菜色搭配上倒是適合。
總的來說是不錯的用餐經驗，有時間的人可以走一趟。","On Saturday night, I asked my colleagues to make dinner with TAVERNIST on the 12th floor of the Ginpton Hotel. Although the restaurant was located in the lively Zhongxiao East Road alley, the atmosphere of the hotel was as cool as the water. The highest 12th floor seems to have entered another space ...
There is a huge spherical ring lamp on the head of the main dining area. It is placed under the ceiling of the naked route.

[Acid bread] Self -made acid bread with fermented cream, handmade bread is soft inside and soft inside, wipe the cream on the bread and send it into the mouth. There is a flour aroma but no heavy sense.
[Black cod and little cucumber] The fish mousse made of cod and fresh cream is paired with three flavored cucumbers. It is smooth and refreshing in the smoothness, the elegant and gentle aroma, and the taste in the mouth.
[Milk and Honey] Soft Riccotta Cheese, pine nuts ice cream with baked nuts in the expected, thin milk yellow powder is a snowflake ice made of rapidly frozen Mozzarella cheese. The kitchen's homemade honey jelly. When serving, the waiter will do not stir, first taste the taste of their respective taste, then eat two or two, and then mix and eat. Various mixes with countless different tastes and stacks of flavors are wonderful. balance.
[Pattous 【【] Consommé, French clarification chicken soup method, then add minced meat and protein to remove impurities.Pour in a small cup of pumping thin slices and ginger in the middle of 15-20 seconds.Tea soup is very delicious. If you chew with ginger with ginger, you can suppress a hint of the unique taste of seafood. If there is no ginger, it may be a failure. This soup personally feels quite a rope.
[Radish cake] The homemade radish cake is made into a detailed round block. If you don't look at it, you will think that it is a western -style crispy seafood cake with water wave eggs.The skin of the radish cake is golden crispy, and the sweet radish can be eaten in the inside. The flavor is 100%.On the side, the shrimp, sausage, cherry shrimp, and pickled radish are fried with xo sauce, and the radish cake tastes delicious and salty flavor. EssenceThe pickled radish and protein in the condiments are the best supporting role, which provides a refreshing and sour cleansing feeling.
[Bone beef & sweet potato & honey garlic] Bone beef beef is fried and crispy, the beef taste is really soft like braised pork, and the knife is separated into shredded pieces. I ca n’t say whether this match is perfect, but I love the taste of juicy beef, which is not very impressed with this way.

People who don't like red and white wine like me, the restaurant's bartending is worthy of a little bit. The bartender based on GIN is refreshing and smooth, which is suitable for dishes.

"早前住宿的時候，用過一次早餐，非常喜歡，於是在他們推出午間套餐的時候來享用，四道菜，無餐前麵包，也無餐後飲料，但吃完超飽。第一道冷湯，連我這討厭喝冷湯的人都覺得好喝，之前試過一些西班牙餐廳的冷湯，總覺得不喜歡，但這碗冷湯卻是色香味俱全。

接下來的干貝米粒飯，口感鮮味都有，第三道香料豬肉捲，說是加了蔓越莓醬之類的，但吃不太出來果酸味，可能有調和了一些五花肉的膩，不過這個豬肉捲真的太大一份，吃到後面感覺又飽又膩(這時候來口白酒應該很搭XD），甜點是一道阿拉斯加，在五花肉捲後，我是覺得應該搭配一些酸度高點的甜點比較能讓胃舒緩一點，所以這道對我來說過甜的甜點，我的印象就是一個字。。。。。甜XD

2. Pet Service Overlooked: During our previous visit, a pet bowl with water was provided without us having to ask. This time, it was only brought out after we specifically requested it. Water was al only reill.

3. Lack of Service Engagement: Throughout the evening, no one introduced themselves as our server. We had to ask for recommendations and details about portion sizes, which is something we expected would be offered proly.

4. Water Service Delay: We ordered a second bottle of S.Pellegrino, but no water was served for 20 minutes. When we inquired, we were informed that the nightshift had forgotten to restock the fridge, we were informed that the nightshift had forgotten to restock the fridge, we were in would nso to so wait to to chill.

Despite this, no voucher was whoed until Iask receiter Even then, the staff seemed uncertain and asked if three hours would be sufficient, despite knowing the length of our stay.

兩年前，因為想帶狗狗一起慶生，在 Tavernist 有過一次很好的用餐體驗，這次決定再帶狗狗一起回來慶祝父親節。很難過的是，這次的體驗遠低於我們的預期，很令人失望，我們不會再回訪。以下是主要原因：

1.餐盤和餐桌問題：
入座後，桌上只有兩包具，桌子還很不穩固。我們是該區第一批到達用餐的，現場還有有幾張空桌，我們詢問是否可以換桌時，服務員告知我們“今天已經訂滿了”，只願意幫我們塞紙平衡桌子。另外，等到開胃菜上次時，我們提醒了服務員後，才拿到了另外兩套餐具。

2.缺乏服務：
整晚沒有服務員和我們自我介紹，每次都是我要招手，才有人來服務，我們也必須主動詢問推薦菜餚和每到菜的份量大小，以餐廳的收費，這些應該是要主動提供的？

3. 寵物服務一樣缺乏：
上次來，一入座，馬上就提供了寵物水碗，而這次我們也是要問才有。

4.沒有冰的氣泡水：
我們要加點第二瓶 S.Pellegrino，但等了20分鐘都沒有上。我們再次加點時，被告知晚班忘了放冰箱，需要等現場冰才能上。好，我們又等了接近一個小時，還是沒有水送上。再次提醒後，才拿到了一瓶「室溫」的氣泡水。又過了30分鐘，服務員才發現，說幫我們換一瓶冰的。最後結帳，帳單上寫我們點了三瓶 S.Pellegrino 的費用，在我質疑後，他們才少算了一瓶的費用。

5.甜點難下嚥：
我們點了芋頭火燒阿拉斯加，這道甜點通常會在桌旁進行點火表演。但這次的呈現非常敷衍，廚房的員工推著推車到我們桌旁，一句介紹沒說，把甜點放在桌上就離開了。蛋白霜完全沒有烤熟，酒味沒燒乾，非常重，我們幾乎吃不下這道甜點。

6.停車折抵問題：
結賬時，我問要怎麼停車折抵，服務員說「每消費2000元可以獲得1小時免費停車，他會提供一張驗證票。」但我信用卡和收據都拿到了，也沒有拿到折抵卷，等了10分鐘後我們主動詢問，服務員才問「三小時夠嗎？」我們預約時間6點前到達，此時已經超過晚上9點。經過多次詢問後，我們拿到4小時的停車折抵，終於可以離開。","Two years 是

"我不得不說我對這頓飯很失望。
他們提供普通的冷麵包，沒有任何蘸醬，所以我不得不要黃油。沙拉還不錯，但我對它的價格期待更多。當天的湯是番茄牛骨湯，味道有點太酸了，沒有骨湯的香味。
T 骨和肋眼牛排是按照說明烹製的，但它要么是美國農業部精選的，要么是精選的，經過測試，就像已經冷凍了很長一段時間一樣。當我要求五分熟時，魚片是五分熟到四分熟，牛排沒有應有的多汁和嫩。我對米其林餐廳的牛排品質感到非常震驚。
烤海鮮拼盤裡的魷魚、牡蠣和扇貝都不錯，除了蝦，蝦頭生的，有腥味。我今晚測試的最好的菜是我為我侄女點的炸魚薯條。
切牛排時桌子搖搖欲墜，但用餐氣氛有一種涼爽的氛圍，我喜歡酒吧區。它還有一個寬敞的陽台，您可以在那裡呼吸新鮮空氣。女服務生很細心，很專業，我沒什麼好抱怨的。
這頓飯我花了NT13000多，所以我預計應該還有更多。我衷心希望他們能升級食材並注重細節，以達到米其林餐盤的標準。","I have to say that I am disappointed with this meal.
They provide ordinary cold bread without any dipping sauce, so I have to have butter.Salad is pretty good, but I look forward to its price more.The soup of the day was tomato beef bone soup. The taste was a bit sour and there was no scent of bone soup.
T -bone and rib eye steak are cooked according to the description, but it is either selected by the US Department of Agriculture or selected. After testing, it is like it has been frozen for a long time.When I ask for five points, the fish fillets are cooked to four cooked, and the steaks are not juicy and tender.I was shocked by the quality of the steak in the Michelin restaurant.
The squid, oysters and scallops in the roasted seafood platter are good. Except for shrimp, shrimp heads, there is a fishy smell.The best dish I tested tonight is the fried fish and fries I ordered for my niece.
The table was crumbling when cutting the steak, but the meal atmosphere had a cool atmosphere. I like the bar area.It also has a spacious balcony that you can breathe fresh air there.The female waiter is very careful and professional. I have nothing to complain about.
I spent more than more than NT13,000 in this meal, so I expect more.I sincerely hope that they can upgrade ingredients and pay attention to details to meet the standards of Michelin dinner plates.",False
"儘管我是這家旅館的設計師 Neri&Hu 的粉絲，我還是決定嘗試 The Tavernist。設計確實不錯，但是餐廳看起來很小。

可以說這是Kimpton飯店的招牌早餐😂和Kimpton Malai(BKK)味道一樣！

- 自製香腸
- 脆皮培根
- 雞蛋的選擇（我：荷包蛋）
- 烤番茄
- 幻燈片酵母麵包
- 咖啡/茶
-果汁
-希臘優格
荷包蛋是這道菜的主角💖💖
希臘優格和配菜沙拉也不錯！

他們還有一個戶外用餐區，但不幸的是，由於陰天，它關閉了。 🥲💦我確實喜歡戶外的氛圍。

我真正喜歡的另一件事是他們的收據卡！我不能因為它的可愛而扔掉它。 🥹🥹💕","Although I am a fan of this hotel designer Neri & Hu, I decided to try the TAVERNIST.The design is really good, but the restaurant looks small.

It can be said that this is the signature breakfast at the Kimpton Hotel and Kimpton Malai (BKK)!

-Sworian sausage
-Krite Bacon
-The choice of eggs (me: poached egg)
-Grill tomato
-Shilidetide yeast bread
-Cofa/tea
-juice
-I Greek Yogeng
The poached egg is the protagonist of this dish 💖💖
Greek Yogeng and side dish salad are also good!

感覺缺乏對細節的關注，這頓飯令人失望。生啤酒水龍頭很甜，表示它沒有正確清潔。沒關係。有很好的瓶裝選擇。預訂時提供品嚐菜單，但在用餐當天改為單點菜單。沒關係，事先知道就好了，但這些事情確實發生了。座位位置讓我整個晚上都在看著垃圾箱被裝卸。沒關係，請服務員關門。沒有發生。不得不向經理詢問餐後大約一個小時才能做到這一點。經理努力讓事情變得正確。仍然很遺憾，食物幾乎全部都很棒。希望他們能做出一些小小的改進，打造真正難忘的用餐體驗。,"It feels disappointing with the lack of attention to details.The raw beer faucet is very sweet, indicating that it is not correctly cleaned.It doesn't matter.There are good bottle options.Provide a tasting menu when booking, but it is changed to a single -order menu on the day of dining.It doesn't matter, just know it in advance, but these things do happen.The seat position made me watch the trash can be loaded and unloaded all night.It doesn't matter, please close the door.No.I have to ask the manager about an hour after the meal to do this.The manager strives to make things correct.Sorry, almost all foods are great.I hope they can make some small improvements and create a truly unforgettable dining experience.",False

我不喜歡這裡的食物。價格過高，份量小，味道一般，而且實際上很鹹。很可能，那天廚師的手很重。但我不會再回去罰款。我們點的魷魚不怎麼樣，有點鹹。炸雞的味道和街上吃的一模一樣，只是海帶醬有點鹹。豬裡肌肉很嫩，但份量很少。我吃的鮑魚出奇的普通。鵪鶉稍微沒煮熟，但仍然有嚼勁和堅韌。對於他們收取的價格來說，分量非常小。拖鞋龍蝦很普通。最後，我們被收取了很多錢，因為這頓飯一點也不美味。環境和氛圍都很好，人群看起來年輕又時尚，服務無可挑剔。但食物並不好吃，之後我去了麥當勞吃了一個漢堡來吃飽。所以這是一次昂貴且令人失望的經驗。,"I don't like the food here.The price is too high, the portion is small, the taste is average, and it is actually very salty.It is likely that the chef's hand was heavy that day.But I won't go back to fine again.The squid we ordered was not very salty.The taste of fried chicken is exactly the same as eating on the street, but kelp sauce is a bit salty.The muscles in the pigs are very tender, but the amount is very small.The abalone I eat is surprisingly ordinary.The quail is not cooked, but it is still chewy and tough.For the price they charged, the weight is very small.Slipper lobster is very ordinary.In the end, we were collected a lot of money because this meal was not delicious at all.The environment and atmosphere are very good, the crowd looks young and fashionable, and the service is impeccable.But the food was not delicious.

第一次坐在戶外。外面的氛圍比坐在室內更加涼爽和放鬆，如果您是那種喜歡沐浴在陽光和微風中的人，我強烈建議您要求坐在戶外。午餐套餐很不錯而且很飽。麵包和甜點味道都還不錯。至於惠靈頓牛排，讓我驚訝的是，肉質非常軟嫩，外皮也很好，但是裹著塗層的duxelles對我來說有點鹹。,"Sit outdoors for the first time.The atmosphere outside is cooler and relaxed than sitting in the room. If you are the kind of person who likes to bathe in the sun and breeze, I strongly recommend that you are asking you to sit outdoors.The lunch package is very good and full.Bread and desserts are pretty good.As for the Wellington steak, what surprised me was that the meat was very soft and the skin was very good, but Duxelles wrapped in coating was a bit salty for me.",False

五花肉主菜擺盤精美。   但它附帶了一塊仍在燃燒的木炭（以保持豬肉的熱度）。  但木炭燃燒的氣味卻令人窒息。  我不想吸入那麼多煙霧，以免給自己帶來肺癌的可能性。  烤豬肉很脆，這是一個優點。  裡肌肉很嫩但不有趣。   然後醬汁就很甜了。  就像服務生說的，味道很重……要嘛鹹，要嘛甜。  烤羽衣甘藍要350新台幣，但只有大約4片葉子...

小酒館老闆所在的旅館非常棒（金普頓）。飯店的服務非常棒，肯定會再次入住。芋頭薯條配雞油蛋黃醬真是太棒了。帶有南瓜泥的魚菜很好吃，兩者都可以單獨使用。喜歡豬肉菜，但不喜歡豬肉。所有的菜餚都做得很好，但整頓飯中缺少一些東西，也許我們沒有點足夠的品種。總的來說，這是一頓不錯的飯菜，但要知道這些菜餚都是共享的，所以如果你想嘗試一切，請帶更多的人來。如果他們稍微解釋一下菜單，服務會很不錯，因為它不是通常的菜單格式。真的很讚揚他們從台灣採購所有產品。,"The hotel where the owner of the tavern owner is great (King Peton).The service of the hotel is great and will definitely stay in again.The taro fries with chicken egg yolk sauce is really great.Fish with pumpkin puree is delicious, and both can be used alone.Like pork vegetables, but don't like pork.All the dishes are made very well, but some things are lacking in the meal, maybe we don't have enough varieties.In general, this is a good meal, but you must know that these dishes are shared, so if you want to try everything, please bring more people.If they explain the menu a little, the service will be very good because it is not the usual menu format.It really praises them to purchase all products from Taiwan.",False

第一次來這裡吃晚餐和飲料。環境氛圍很好，室外和室內都非常注重細節。立即上Instagram。然而，當涉及食物和飲料時，它還有很多不足之處，因此 3 顆星。就其實際價格而言，台北的價格遠高於平均水準。套餐菜單看起來已經令人懷疑，所以我們選擇了牛肉麵。真的很油膩，麵條也太軟了。當你想在台北以高價出售牛肉麵時，你最好讓它嘗起來除了高價之外別無他物。沙拉味道還可以，但有點濕，所以味道不太新鮮。通心粉（真的嗎？）看起來不太好，我的伙伴幾乎沒有吃，並說它不是很好。飲料很少。提拉米蘇和羊角麵包在菜單上是一個奇怪的東西（為什麼不保持簡單）。我們的兩款酒都沒有裝滿標準量度的酒。服務還是不錯的。我會再次回到那裡只是為了飲料和很棒的屋頂環境，這在台北是一個罕見的地方。,"The first time I came here for dinner and drinks.The atmosphere of the environment is very good, and the outdoor and indoor are very focused on details.Immediately go to Instagram.However, when food and drinks are involved, there are still many shortcomings, so 3 stars.As far as its actual price is concerned, Taipei is much higher than the average level.The package menu looks doubtful, so we chose beef noodles.It's really greasy and the noodles are too soft.When you want to sell beef noodles at high prices in Taipei, you better let it taste no other things except high prices.The salad taste is okay, but it is a bit wet, so the taste is not very fresh.Tongxin Fan (really?) It looks not very good, my partners have hardly eaten, and say that it is not very good.There are few drinks.Tiramisu and Horn bread are a strange thing on the menu (why not keep it simple).Both of our wines are not full of standards.The service is good.I will return there again just for drinking and a great roof environment, which is a rare place in Taipei.",False

餐廳位於金普頓酒店美麗的 12 樓。因此，我很喜歡菜單上的菜單，既可以滿足飯店客人想要快餐的需求，又可以提供 6 道菜的美食品嚐菜單（其中 2 道菜是甜點）。我選擇了後者，很快就收到了一本小冊子，解釋了品嚐菜單的概念，即孟買一天的旅程——包括“早餐”、“午餐”、“下午小吃”和“晚餐”。有瞭如此美妙的設置，我抱有很高的期望 - 遺憾的是只實現了部分。毫無疑問，菜單採用高品質食材烹製而成 - 開胃菜包括鵝肝醬，羊排非常光滑且味道溫和。儘管如此，這些菜餚還是給人一種高端版的舒適食品的感覺。令人難以置信的是，這是一頓不含蔬菜的餐，僅含有蛋白質、碳水化合物和脂肪，其味道僅來自香料、脂肪和糖。這是一次有趣的經歷，但我不用再吃它了——而且2080元的令人興奮的價格，這並不是特別物有所值！我還品嚐了雞尾酒（3杯1080元，性價比很高）。其中一款非常出色，帶有香料、紅色水果和煙熏味，與羊肉完美搭配；另一款則非常出色。一種是美味的柑橘混合物，有點淹沒在裝滿冰的杯子裡，另一種是平淡的甜點雞尾酒。,"The restaurant is located on the 12th floor of the Ginpton Hotel.Therefore, I like the menu on the menu, which can not only meet the needs of hotel guests to want fast food, but also provide 6 foods for food and taste menu (2 of them are desserts).I chose the latter and quickly received a booklet to explain the concept of tasting the menu, that is, the journey of Mumbai's one day -including ""breakfast"", ""lunch"", ""afternoon snacks"" and ""dinner"".With such a wonderful setting, I have high expectations -unfortunately, I only realized the part.There is no doubt that the menu is cooked with high -quality ingredients -appetizers include foie gras, and sheep chops are very smooth and mild.Nevertheless, these dishes still give people a high -end version of the comfortable food.It is incredible that this is a meal without vegetables that contain only protein, carbohydrates and fat, and its taste comes only from spices, fat and sugar.This is an interesting experience, but I don't need to eat it anymore -and the exciting price of 2080 yuan, this is not worth the special thing!I also tasted cocktails (3 cups of 1080 yuan, cost -effective).One of them is very outstanding, with spices, red fruits and smoke flavors, perfectly matched with mutton; the other is very good.One is a delicious citrus mixture, which is a bit drowned in a full ice cup, and the other is a flat dessert cocktail.",False
裝潢風格高檔，食物風味也相得益彰。  然而，與氛圍相比，食物背後的技巧就顯得乏善可陳。  人們自然會期望450NT的炸雞比6塊標準炸雞和一個不起眼的醬汁更有創意。  這些飲料的想法很好，但執行得很差。  他們的味道有一種只能從廉價威士忌中獲得的酒精味，而不是從均衡的產品中獲得的味道。  很遺憾看到這個錯失的機會。,"The decoration style is high -end, and the food flavor is complemented.However, compared with the atmosphere, the techniques behind food are lacking.People naturally expect 450NT fried chicken than 6 standard fried chicken and a humble sauce.The ideas of these beverages are very good, but they are poorly implemented.The taste of their taste can only be obtained from cheap whiskeys, not the taste that is obtained from a balanced product.Unfortunately, I see this missed opportunity.",False

首先，飯店的入口比我想像的簡單，沒什麼好看的。流動的水有氯氣的味道。
從餐廳門口看到的景色。孩子們在尖叫，男性顧客穿著 T 恤和拖鞋。雖然主頁上寫著著裝要求，但完全被忽略了。
當我點菜時遇到困難時，我的 iPad 上顯示了帶有圖片的選單。
從照片來看，有一些我很期待的菜單項，但...這味道不像你在餐廳裡想想像的那樣。確實，主頁上說這是對台灣當地美食的致敬。但是 Noma 有前廚師嗎？

首先是烤魷魚。光是烤魷魚就讓人以為是熱炒（台灣便宜的居酒屋）。數量很小。檸檬醬只灑到了令人失望的程度。它的味道正如你想像的那樣。
30分鐘後，鴨胸肉。鴨子很有嚼勁，味道鮮美，是台灣特色。然而，酒汁太淡，與鴨肉相襯，盤子裡的玉米粥偏鹹，但與鴨肉結合在一起，兩者的味道就模糊了，分散了注意力。旁邊的格蘭諾拉麥片還不錯，但就是早餐！鴨子要加鹽吃。
烤羽衣甘藍。有人告訴我它一定是甜的，因為它是用薯條熏制的，並與蘋果醋混合，但它聞起來像煙，嘗起來像被火燒過的羽衣甘藍。吃下去的時候，全身都像著火了一樣。啊，不過菠菜醬很好吃。
還有羊肩肉。這是什麼？我猜他們已經盡力消除朗姆酒的味道了。和紅燒肉差不多。我收到一杯蒙達維紅葡萄酒，我把它吞了下去，但我沒能喝完。
兩個人5000多塊錢一點。 CP太差了

When I encountered difficulties when I ordered, my iPad showed a menu with pictures.
Judging from the photos, there are some menu items that I am looking forward to, but ... this taste is not as if you want to imagine in the restaurant.Indeed, the homepage says that this is a tribute to local food in Taiwan.But does NOMA have former chefs?

The first is grilled squid.Squid alone makes people think it is hot (Taiwan's cheap izakaya).The quantity is small.Lemon sauce only sprinkled to the degree of disappointment.It tastes like what you think.
After 30 minutes, duck breasts.The ducks are very chewy, delicious, and the characteristics of Taiwan.However, the wine juice is too light and lined with duck meat. The corn porridge in the plate is salty, but with the combination of duck meat, the taste of the two is blurred and dispersed.The Grandorra Macian next to me is pretty good, but it is breakfast!Add salt to duck.
Baked feathers cabbage.Someone told me that it must be sweet because it was smoked with fries and mixed with apple cider vinegar, but it smelled like a smoke and tasted it like a feathers that had been burned by fire.When I eat it, my whole body looks like a fire.Ah, but spinach sauce is delicious.
There are also sheep shoulder meat.What's this?I guess they have tried their best to eliminate the taste of Rum.Similar to braised pork.I received a glass of Moncaine red wine, and I swallow it, but I couldn't finish it.

"2020年八月二十日在這聚餐：非常糟糕的一次經歷，以後再也不會去這個餐廳了……因為我不太會中文，以下用中文分享酒館老闆聲稱他們是一家寵物友好的餐廳，但他們不是，當我們討論我們10個人帶著狗是否可以進入預訂的餐廳時，餐廳經理Catherine Chen表現出了她的傲慢。  她甚至不明白「寵物友善」的意思，卻為了挽回面子，堅持一些無關的理由。非常不專業地處理這個令人困惑的規則：除了進入私人房間外，可以攜帶寵物到酒店和餐廳各處，我們為不打擾他人而保留了私人房間，並願意支付近4 萬新台幣的最低消費。  她以政府規定為藉口，但是嘿，看，門口旁邊有一張桌子和她的狗！凱瑟琳，你在說什麼？  你不明白寵物友善餐廳的意思嗎？  她拒絕邀請她的老闆，因為她知道自己錯了，但她只是要面子不肯承認她的無知

2020年8月26日 回覆 The Tavernist 的回覆：
1. 當我們預訂時，你們的團隊已經向我們確認這是一個寵物友善的地方。
2. 當我們溝通時，Catherine 和她的團隊並沒有解釋「無寵物」是什麼意思，當我們使用「寵物友善」這個術語時，她也沒有反對我們。
3.靠近入口處的桌子，顯然是餐廳區域，坐著一個女人和她的狗。這就是為什麼我們如此困惑為什麼私人房間不允許寵物？
4. 請停止玩弄文字遊戲，真誠的道歉以表明您的團隊是專業的。您無法用言語來區分無寵物和寵物友好，當您的酒店充滿寵物時，您如何定義這兩者？
最後，問題確實在於凱瑟琳對這種情況的處理有多糟糕。但從你的回覆來看，你的酒館團隊顯然什麼也沒學到！","August 20, 2020 at this dinner: a very bad experience, I will never go to this restaurant anymore ... because I don't know Chinese in Chinese, the owner of the tavern in Chinese claims that they are a pet -friendly restaurant, But they are not. When we discuss whether 10 people can enter the restaurant with the dogs, Catherine Chen shows her arrogance.She didn't even understand the meaning of ""pet friendship"", but insisted on some unrelated reasons in order to save her face.It is very unprofessional to deal with this confusing rule: In addition to entering the private room, we can bring pets to the hotels and restaurants. We retain the private room in order not to disturb others, and are willing to pay nearly NT $ 40,000 to the minimum consumption EssenceShe is an excuse for government regulations, but hey, look, there is a table and her dog next to the door!Catherine, what are you talking about?Don't you understand the meaning of pets friendly restaurants?She refused to invite her boss, because she knew she was wrong, but she just wanted her face and refused to admit her ignorance.

A reply to The TAvernist on August 26, 2020:
1. When we book, your team has confirmed to us that this is a pet friendly place.
2. When we communicate, Catherine and her team did not explain what ""no pet"" means. When we use the term ""pet friendship"", she did not oppose us.
3. The table near the entrance is obviously the restaurant area with a woman and her dog.That's why we are so confused, why don't we allow pets in private rooms?
4. Please stop playing with text games, and sincerely apologize to indicate that your team is professional.You cannot distinguish between pets and pets with words. When your hotel is full of pets, how do you define the two?
