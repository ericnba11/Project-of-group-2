熱門的金山在地美食餐廳，招牌菜有香煎豬肝、墨魚香腸、花椰菜乾滷大腸等。不過很不好的是，菜的價格非常不透明，牆上沒有告示，也沒有菜單，而且店家還會看人比較多就自動升級大盤的量但不主動告知客人，所以價格很亂，也很不一致，去過三次都是這樣。雖然菜是好吃的，但這樣的收費方式蠻不好的，希望店家能注意並把價格公示。謝謝！,"The popular Kingsoft is located in the ground food restaurant. The signature dishes include fried pork liver, cuttlefish sausage, and dried brown into the large intestine.However, it is very bad that the price of the dishes is very opaque, there are no notices on the wall, no menu, and the store will automatically upgrade the volume of the broader market, but do not actively inform the guests, so the price is messy and inconsistent.

"第二次來，上次經驗不錯，煎豬肝很好吃但是太鹹，故這次嘗試其他菜色：炒麵、冬瓜排骨酥湯、和墨魚香腸、地瓜葉、劍筍、油雞、脆花滷大腸共五道菜，總共1450，價位很划算，份量不小，兩人來吃已經做好打包帶走的心理準備。整體而言蠻好吃的，不會過鹹，不配白飯吃也沒問題。值得一提的是上菜速度超快，很餓的情況下可以立刻被填飽。

炒麵：看起來好像超太爛的樣子，賣相沒有很好，但是實際吃了口感剛剛好不會太爛，調味剛剛好，被外表誤會了！

冬瓜排骨酥湯：冬瓜似乎是蔭冬瓜，湯色是茶色，剛入口有驚訝，有一種不常喝到的古早味。排骨酥我不喜歡，但是我先生很喜歡。整體而言湯很清甜不死鹹，冬瓜很入味，是一道滿推薦的湯品。

墨魚香腸：炸過的墨魚香腸外酥內軟，附上的蒜頭辣味十足，大人吃了覺得很爽快，小孩子吃一定超愛。

地瓜葉：問了店家知道地瓜葉是用蒜片和米醬下去水炒，不過油不死鹹，因為米醬的關係還帶有一點甜味，地瓜葉本身很嫩，很大一盤。

炒劍筍：劍筍完全沒有太老的部分，一樣有加入米醬下去炒，這道調味非常剛好，單吃不配白飯都很好入口，愛吃劍筍的人很推薦點來嚐嚐。

油雞：是冷的，很有醉雞的口感，很入味很好吃，我們覺得要是路過也會想外帶一份回家吃。

脆花滷大腸：曬乾的白花菜跟大腸一起滷煮，白花菜非常脆，大腸滷得很透也處理得很乾淨，看起來會很鹹很下飯的菜，其實不然，反而比炒劍筍的味道還清淡，小時候阿嬤會煮的菜，好吃的一道菜現在還能吃到覺得很滿足。","The second time, the last experience is good, the fried pork liver is delicious but too salty, so this time I try other dishes: fried noodles, melon pork ribs soup, and cuttlefish sausage, sweet potato leaves, sword bamboo shoots, oil chicken, crispy flower halogen, brown flower halogen There are five dishes in the large intestine, with a total of 1450. The price is very cost -effective and the portion is not small.Overall is pretty delicious, it won't be too salty, and it is okay not to eat white rice.It is worth mentioning that the speed of serving is super fast, and when you are hungry, you can be filled immediately.

Fried noodles: It looks super bad. It is not very good for selling, but in fact, it will not be too bad to eat it. The seasoning is just right and misunderstood by the appearance!

Winter melon pork ribs crispy soup: Winter melon seems to be a shade of winter melon, the soup color is tea color, and there is a surprise at the entrance. There is an ancient taste that is not drinking often.I don't like the pork ribs crispy, but my husband likes it very much.On the whole, the soup is very sweet and not dead and salty. Winter melon is very delicious. It is a recommended soup.

Ink fish sausage: The fried cuttlefish sausages are crispy and soft inside, and the attached garlic is full of spicy taste. The adults feel very refreshing when they eat it. Children must love it.

Sweet potato leaves: I asked the store to know that the melon leaves were fried with garlic slices and rice sauce, but the oil was not dead and salty, because the relationship between rice sauce also had a bit of sweetness. The sweet potato leaves were very tender and large.

Fried sword bamboo shoots: The sword bamboo shoots are not too old. They also add rice sauce and stir fry. This seasoning is very good. It is very good to eat or not with white rice. People who love to eat sword bamboo shoots are recommended to taste.

Oil chicken: It is cold, it has a taste of drunk chicken, it is very delicious and delicious. We feel that if you pass by, we will want to take a copy of it.

Crispy flower halogen large intestine: The dried white cauliflower is stewed with the large intestine. The white cauliflower is very crispy, the large intestine is very transparent and handled well. The taste is still light. When I was a kid, I could cook the dishes that Grandma could cook. A delicious dish can still be satisfied.",False

"金山老街旁的餐廳，地點在立體停車場約5分鐘路程，開車前往很方便。傳統的桌菜海鮮餐廳，1樓是主要的用餐區，2樓為包廂區，從裝潢擺設看起來既可感受到歷史悠久，假日的時候人非常多。
海鮮十分新鮮好吃，推薦石斑、清蒸小卷。","The restaurant next to Jinshan Old Street, the location is about 5 minutes at a three -dimensional parking lot. It is convenient to drive.The traditional table vegetables and seafood restaurants are the main dining area on the first floor. The second floor is the box area.

我們點了墨魚香腸（外皮酥脆非常好吃，推薦必點）、花菜干肥腸、冬瓜排骨酥湯的冬瓜很入味、髮菜羹海鮮捲可以依人數點菜、鹽焗雞肉多鮮嫩、還點了一盤炒蛤蠣也很好吃，還有一盤炒空心菜，六菜一湯四碗飯兩瓶飲料，結帳2035，停車場先收100，結帳時憑券扣抵消費，幾台車都可以全數抵扣，份量很足夠，吃很飽，覺得比網路評價的還實惠，整體來說很推薦。","The business is very good, many ancient and early flavors are very special.

"⭐2021/8/14 -「兄弟食堂」⭐⁣
⁣
台灣目前盼到微解封，到了常去的金山老街，少部份的餐廳已開放內用，平常到金山老街常經過「兄弟食堂」但從沒進去用餐過，而且以前假日都是人潮，可能剛解封，進去用餐時沒什麼人，而且有用隔板且每一桌也都離很遠，於是就選擇在這用餐了。⁣
⁣
以下是當日點的菜色⁣
⁣
★石斑魚二吃：魚身用清蒸，魚頭煮薑絲清湯，魚肉鮮度尚可，魚皮厚實膠質多，魚肉也很Q彈，清蒸調味還不錯，但魚頭煮薑絲清湯個人覺得魚的鮮度沒煮出來，薑味不足也無魚味，有點像是開水略失望，而魚是稱重的，記得先詢問一下價格，我們吃的這隻是730元，個人覺得觀光區尚可。⁣
⁣
★炒蛤蜊：這道是用九層塔拌炒，鹹甜適中且下飯，算是重口味的一道菜，但個人覺得還不錯吃，也是今天喜歡的一道菜。⁣
⁣
★燙大卷：單純燙大卷無其它調味，沾五味醬，鮮度尚可但甜度不足，個人覺得普通，可以跳過。⁣
⁣
★炒地瓜葉：個人覺得份量很足，而且很特別是用黃豆豉及大量的大蒜調味火候也足，算是重口味但整個香氣十足也很下飯，是今天感到最滿意的一道菜，而且我們本來是點炒空心菜，結果店員炒錯了，也算是意外的收獲，差點錯過這道美食!⁣
⁣
總結~個人覺得快炒類都是重口味的，但覺得都很我口味，反倒是清蒸、清湯、水燙的料理就很普通，不過算是個人還會到訪的餐廳，只是可能就專攻快炒類的，價錢當天結帳以上全部1200元，如果將石斑魚730元扣除，其它三道菜兩碗白飯為470元，其實個人覺得價格也算合理，因為他的為份量也算是比平常快炒店多，下次再來金山會想再試試其它招牌菜!⁣

Bleak
Taiwan is currently looking forward to the micro -sealed sealed. When it comes to Jinshan Old Street, a small part of restaurants have been used in interior. I usually go through the ""Brother Canteen"" when I go to Jinshan Old Street, but I have never entered meals. It may be just unblocked. There is no one when I go in to eat, and the useful partitions and each table are far away, so I chose to eat here.Bleak
Bleak
The following is the dish at the day 日
Bleak
★ Stir -grouped fish Er Er: Steamed fish bodies, cooked ginger clear soup with fish head, freshness of fish meat, thick fish skin and thick glue, fish meat is also very q bomb, steamed flavoring is not bad, but the fish head boiled ginger soup soup I personally think that the freshness of the fish is not cooked, the ginger taste is not enough and there is no fish smell. It is a bit disappointed as boiling water, and the fish is weighing. Remember to ask the price first. You can.Bleak
Bleak
★ Stir -fried clams: This is stir -fried with a nine -layer tower. It is salty and sweet and meals. It is a dish with a heavy taste, but I personally think that it is pretty good. It is also a dish that I like today.Bleak
Bleak
★ Big scorching: Simple hot rolls have no other flavor, dipped in Wuxiang sauce, and the freshness is still available but the sweetness is insufficient. I personally think that it is ordinary and can skip it.Bleak
Bleak
★ Frying sweet potato leaves: Personally feel that the portion is sufficient, and it is also very special to season with mockery and a large amount of garlic. It is a heavy taste but the whole aroma is full. It was orderly stir -fry. As a result, the clerk was wrong. It was an unexpected harvest. Almost missed this food! ⁣
Bleak
Summary ~ Personally, I think it ’s heavy -duty fried category, but I think it’ s all of my taste. For the class, the price of the price above is all 1200 yuan. If the grouper 730 yuan is deducted, the other three three dishes and two bowls of rice are 470 yuan. There are many fried restaurants, next time you come to Jinshan again, you will want to try other signature dishes!

必點魚捲有四捲之多，地瓜葉軟爛好下飯。可惜我點的三杯田雞在點菜時沒有跟店家溝通清楚，上菜後才發現是鹹酥田雞而不是三杯。後來得知兄弟食堂沒有三杯口味的菜餚，原因是製作過程太「搞剛」（某店員直言相告）...

以上六菜一湯加一瓶飲料，共1850，真的新鮮好吃又實惠。不過豬肝跟花椰菜乾這兩道店家的招牌菜因為太座不敢吃就沒點了。","The first time the mouse was soaked ️
Although it is not cold enough today, the soup house in the entire Wanli Jinshan area on the second day of the new year is almost full.

Because I spent too much time looking for the soup house, I was already hungry after soaking, but fortunately, I found a 4 -star shop near the old street near Jinshan Jinshan Jinshan Jindao.

The scallion oil chicken in the seafood restaurant is generally not expected, but this one is really delicious. I later asked for raw chili soy sauce, which was even more enjoyable.

"⭐2021/8/14 -「兄弟食堂」⭐⁣
⁣
台灣目前盼到微解封，到了常去的金山老街，少部份的餐廳已開放內用，平常到金山老街常經過「兄弟食堂」但從沒進去用餐過，而且以前假日都是人潮，可能剛解封，進去用餐時沒什麼人，而且有用隔板且每一桌也都離很遠，於是就選擇在這用餐了。⁣
⁣
以下是當日點的菜色⁣
⁣
★石斑魚二吃：魚身用清蒸，魚頭煮薑絲清湯，魚肉鮮度尚可，魚皮厚實膠質多，魚肉也很Q彈，清蒸調味還不錯，但魚頭煮薑絲清湯個人覺得魚的鮮度沒煮出來，薑味不足也無魚味，有點像是開水略失望，而魚是稱重的，記得先詢問一下價格，我們吃的這隻是730元，個人覺得觀光區尚可。⁣
⁣
★炒蛤蜊：這道是用九層塔拌炒，鹹甜適中且下飯，算是重口味的一道菜，但個人覺得還不錯吃，也是今天喜歡的一道菜。⁣
⁣
★燙大卷：單純燙大卷無其它調味，沾五味醬，鮮度尚可但甜度不足，個人覺得普通，可以跳過。⁣
⁣
★炒地瓜葉：個人覺得份量很足，而且很特別是用黃豆豉及大量的大蒜調味火候也足，算是重口味但整個香氣十足也很下飯，是今天感到最滿意的一道菜，而且我們本來是點炒空心菜，結果店員炒錯了，也算是意外的收獲，差點錯過這道美食!⁣
⁣
總結~個人覺得快炒類都是重口味的，但覺得都很我口味，反倒是清蒸、清湯、水燙的料理就很普通，不過算是個人還會到訪的餐廳，只是可能就專攻快炒類的，價錢當天結帳以上全部1200元，如果將石斑魚730元扣除，其它三道菜兩碗白飯為470元，其實個人覺得價格也算合理，因為他的為份量也算是比平常快炒店多，下次再來金山會想再試試其它招牌菜!⁣

#金山美食⁣","/2021/8/14- ""Brother Canteen"" ⭐⁣
Bleak
Taiwan is currently looking forward to the micro -sealed sealed. When it comes to Jinshan Old Street, a small part of restaurants have been used in interior. I usually go through the ""Brother Canteen"" when I go to Jinshan Old Street, but I have never entered meals. It may be just unblocked. There is no one when I go in to eat, and the useful partitions and each table are far away, so I chose to eat here.Bleak
Bleak
The following is the dish at the day 日
Bleak
★ Stir -grouped fish Er Er: Steamed fish bodies, cooked ginger clear soup with fish head, freshness of fish meat, thick fish skin and thick glue, fish meat is also very q bomb, steamed flavoring is not bad, but the fish head boiled ginger soup soup I personally think that the freshness of the fish is not cooked, the ginger taste is not enough and there is no fish smell. It is a bit disappointed as boiling water, and the fish is weighing. Remember to ask the price first. You can.Bleak
Bleak
★ Stir -fried clams: This is stir -fried with a nine -layer tower. It is salty and sweet and meals. It is a dish with a heavy taste, but I personally think that it is pretty good. It is also a dish that I like today.Bleak
Bleak
★ Big scorching: Simple hot rolls have no other flavor, dipped in Wuxiang sauce, and the freshness is still available but the sweetness is insufficient. I personally think that it is ordinary and can skip it.Bleak
Bleak
★ Frying sweet potato leaves: Personally feel that the portion is sufficient, and it is also very special to season with mockery and a large amount of garlic. It is a heavy taste but the whole aroma is full. It was orderly stir -fry. As a result, the clerk was wrong. It was an unexpected harvest. Almost missed this food! ⁣
Bleak
Summary ~ Personally, I think it ’s heavy -duty fried category, but I think it’ s all of my taste. For the class, the price of the price above is all 1200 yuan. If the grouper 730 yuan is deducted, the other three three dishes and two bowls of rice are 470 yuan. There are many fried restaurants, next time you come to Jinshan again, you will want to try other signature dishes!

"上菜非常快👍
平日午餐時間人不多，每桌客人之間都隔滿遠的，其他客人用完餐後，看到店家有用酒精消毒桌面

紀錄幾個比較有印象的菜🔖
🔹墨魚香腸
首先我必須要說，這不是真的香腸🤣，應該只是把魷魚、魚漿和墨汁做成香腸的形狀而已，吃起來像高雄常見的炸黑輪，酥酥的
🔹脆花大腸
大腸就是一般的滷大腸，口感比較軟，不是Q彈的那種，脆花是花椰菜乾，吃起來很像筍乾，但是又沒有筍乾那麼會吸收湯汁，常常吸了滷汁變得太鹹太軟，花椰菜保留本身脆脆的口感，並且不會太鹹，超喜歡這道菜🤩
🔹髮菜魚卷
吃起來就是，有點像蝦捲，有蝦仁、魚肉，還不錯，只是荸薺（？）感覺有點太多

⭐店裡有提供白開水（飲水機","It's very fast to serve 👍
There are not many people usually lunch, and each guest is far away. After the meal is completed, other guests see that the store uses alcohol disinfection desktop

Record a few more impressive dishes 🔖
🔹 🔹 🔹 🔹 🔹 🔹
First of all, I have to say that this is not a real sausage sausage. It should just make squid, fish pulp and ink into the shape of sausage. It tastes like a common fried black wheel in Kaohsiung, crispy
Crispy flower large intestine
The large intestine is a general marinated large intestine, and the taste is relatively soft. It is not the type of Q bomb. The crispy flower is dried broccoli. It tastes like dried bamboo shoots, but it will absorb the soup like dried bamboo shoots. Salt is too soft, cauliflower retains its own crispy taste, and it will not be too salty, so I like this dish 🤩

It's a bit like shrimp rolls, shrimp and fish, it's not bad, but it feels a bit too much

菜色不錯上菜的速度也非常快，再加上服務態度也好，是會想再去第二次的店家。,"The dishes are very fast, and the service attitude is good. It is a shop that wants to go to the second time.",False
好吃的傳統海鮮餐廳，如果假日去可能沒有很好的用餐環境及氛圍，但是傳統海鮮餐廳就是如此，雖然傳統但是菜色不錯味道都很好價格也實在，建議還是平日去吃~,"The delicious traditional seafood restaurant may not have a good dining environment and atmosphere if you go on holidays, but the traditional seafood restaurant is the case.

In fact, the point is not because of her attitude that made me just want to finish eating.",False
沒看到菜單，冰櫃上貼照片供人點菜，沒有價錢讓人心驚驚，點菜阿姨努力推銷海產也讓人有壓力，最好自己先做功課，點菜時才不會被牽著走。吃完後覺得食物真的不錯，價錢還好也不貴，不過還是希望菜單上能標價啦！,"I didn’t see the menu, posted photos on the freezer for people to order, no price was shocking.
