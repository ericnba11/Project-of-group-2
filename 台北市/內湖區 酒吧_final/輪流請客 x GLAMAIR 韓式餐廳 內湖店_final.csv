馬鈴薯排骨湯：沒有馬鈴薯的馬鈴薯排骨湯，我們怎麼都撈不到馬鈴薯，後來請服務人員來撈，也撈不到馬鈴薯，最後服務人員去廚房裝了六小塊的馬鈴薯來加進湯裡，一鍋880元的湯，裡面除了排骨根本沒什麼料，不是太值得，還好排骨夠爛，湯頭也還可以。
海鮮煎餅：吃了滿嘴油！裡面沒甚麼料，又薄，但是油卻滿滿的，是我們吃了1、2片就無法吃完的餐點。
辣炒年糕：第一次吃到顏色這麼淡的辣炒年糕，應該是改良台灣人能吃的口味吧！味道尚可，但是沒有韓國味。
蔬菜雜菜：是整桌最好吃的一道餐點，只是還是有點偏油，尚可接受。
魚卵起司蛋：熱熱很好吃。
總結....這是間不是道地韓國味的韓國餐廳，連小菜都不是很道地的味道，但是台灣人接受度應該會蠻高的，這樣的價位，份量跟配菜不是太值得，但是服務人員的服務真的很不錯，這個很讚美。

Finally, the service staff went to the kitchen to install six small pieces of potatoes to add it into the soup. A pot of 880 yuan soup, there is nothing except the pork ribs, it is not too worth it.

🔺三人套餐 $1580
部隊鍋：泡菜湯頭偏不辣，有豆腐、起司泡麵、午餐肉、德腸、火腿、年糕，起司泡麵只有一塊，以為多人分食會多，韓國豆腐真的都很好吃，年糕切薄片，加工肉都表現不錯
醃烤豬梅花：不用自己烤好舒服🥰烤的嫩香，一大盤配上洋蔥還算解油膩
爆炸陶鍋蛋：底下都燒焦的，是溫控沒掌握好？北村比較好吃
烤肉石鍋拌飯：韓式必吃的拌飯，把自己喜歡的小菜和著辣醬一起拌勻，還不錯吃！

🔺輪流請客海鮮煎餅 $380
切法跟月亮蝦餅不一樣是切方格狀，挺大塊的，4-6人分著吃試味道還ok，不能吃多油耗味重，特製沾醬酸甜可以解膩。內料有魷魚、蝦仁、花枝等常見海鮮料，再加上紅蘿蔔和蔥段，麵糊類似大阪燒軟糊

🔺蔬食雜菜 $270
粗冬粉拌上豆芽菜、菠菜和紅胡蔔，再灑上白芝麻，因為吃過好市多的冷凍雜菜點來回味，結果挺失望的，冬粉糾結在一起不夠味，配料跟冬粉沒交集各自表述

🔺辣炒魚板
沒有很夠味，魚板跟年糕沒有很吸湯汁

有六種韓式小菜可以免費無限享用～
當天吃到魚板、豆芽、涼拌黃瓜、鳥蛋、韓式泡菜、醃蘿蔔，讓我不禁跟北村做比較，北村好吃多了😅

石鍋拌飯不錯吃，自行趁熱拌飯，會有一點鍋巴，口味還不錯。但發現店員幫隔壁桌的客人拌飯，就覺得有點失落。是說自己拌也不錯。可能隔壁桌有妹子。
海鮮煎餅比較軟，切成小方塊，適合分食。

口味也不太行，明明是辣炒豬，結果口味甜的讓人懷疑。

餐廳服務部分，從入座的拉椅子、倒水全都是自己來，連點餐也是用QR code點餐，完全沒有被服務到，到底為什麼要收服務費？

菜單上寫說小菜跟湯品可以無限續，但服務人員也完全沒告知該如何續餐。","Go to dinner with my colleagues, I ordered spicy stir -fried pork. Only two pieces of meat that barely can see the shape of the meat in the whole dish. The others are all small minced meat in the plate. Employees are obviously large and complete.

The restaurant service section comes from the seats and pouring water. Even the order of ordering is to order with QR Code. It is not served at all. Why should I charge a service fee?

"看了部落客推薦來吃，果然部落客推薦大部份都是……
當天點了雙人套餐跟單點炸雞，第一次吃韓式料理吃的這麼不開心

魚卵石鍋飯－不知道是不是鍋子不夠熱，完全做不出石鍋飯的鍋巴，裡面的醬料也不是韓國的甜辣醬料。 雪獄山的都比這裡好吃
韓式醬燒豬肉－很像比較貴的熱炒100的炒豬肉
部隊鍋－味道還可以，唯一比較接近韓式口味的菜色。 但是料不多而且都是便宜的食材要價600很誇張
單點半半炸雞－吃到快結束了才上桌，一度覺得被遺忘，一上桌後馬上失望。 單看外觀就完全不想吃。 雞皮跟肉是分開的，入口很油。 沒有像NEME那樣處理的乾爽。並且雞肉是完全沒味道的，不是過醃後下去炸。
附的兩個醬 一個是椒鹽粉（原味）一個是奇怪的酸甜醬（祕製）沾哪個都無法拯救這極難吃的炸雞. 後來打包外帶沒附醬料

還有一個小插曲：附近座位的阿姨一入座就跟工作人員反應頭上會滴水，結果員工只是回應說：喔因為如何如何；所以水管怎樣怎樣，才會滴水（沒聽清楚）
為什麼客人反應頭上會滴水,員工只是解釋,沒有要換座位？？（沒有客滿，還有其他空位）
一直到過了大概5分鐘，才有另一個店員過來請阿姨換位子

主打「道地韓式料理」保證口味一定韓，但是除了免費的小菜有點韓味，今天吃的菜說實在根本沒有一樣有韓式口味。 在韓國吃過再難吃的料理都沒有這餐失望。餐點味道真的有用心調製嗎?
而且cp值非常不高，這樣的價位在梨谷可以吃的很開心,在北投阿里郎可以吃兩頓非常飽。","After watching bloggers recommending to eat, it really is ...
On the same day, I ordered a double set meal and a single -order fried chicken. The first time I ate Korean cuisine so unhappy

Fish Mattop Rice -I don't know if the pot is not hot enough. It can't make a pot of pot rice. The sauce inside is not a sweet and spicy sauce in Korea.Snow Prison Mountain is better than here
Korean sauce -roasted pork -very similar to the more expensive stir -fry 100 fried pork
The troops pot -taste is okay, the only dish is closer to Korean flavor.But there are not many and all cheap ingredients. The price is 600 very exaggerated
One and a half -half fried chicken -I got on the table until the end was over, and I felt forgotten for a while.Just look at the appearance and don't want to eat at all.Chicken skin is separated from meat, and the entrance is very oily.There is no drying like NEME.And the chicken is completely flavorful, not frying after being pickled.
One of the two sauce with one of the salt and pepper powder (original), one is a strange sweet and sour sauce (secret).

There is also a small episode: the aunt in the nearby seat reacts with the staff when she enters the seat. As a result, the employee only responds to: Oh, what is because of the water pipe, so what is the water pipe, and the water will be dripping (not clearly hear)
Why does the guest react to the water, and the employees just explain that they have not wanted to change their seats?Intersection(No full, there are other vacancies)
It wasn't until about 5 minutes, and another clerk came to ask the aunt to change the seat.

The main ""duct Korean cuisine"" guarantees that the taste must be Korean, but except for free side dishes, it is a bit Korean. The dishes that are eaten today have no Korean flavor.No matter how unpleasant dishes have been eaten in South Korea, there is no disappointment.Is the meal taste really prepared?

"3.5顆星

本次中午消費商業套餐，點了韓式拌飯與泡菜鍋，其他商品也蠻多的（總共大概七、八種）。

韓式拌飯的味道還可以，以中餐來說整體的份量也算足。

泡菜鍋整體的味道不錯，湯頭很濃鬱夠味，味道吃起來蠻道地的，但是泡菜鍋的料稍少。

商業午餐都附三樣小菜（本次有泡菜、豆芽與半顆韓式滷蛋），小菜可以續加這點值得鼓勵，這樣才是道地韓國料理。

整體的裝潢不錯，燈飾很新潮，環境整潔乾淨，採光明亮，靠牆的座位區的連體座椅比較不舒服，另外餐具是亮點，大概是我吃過的韓式餐廳裡餐具最佳的。

價格以一般午餐來說可能稍高，商業套餐一份NT$229需額外加服務費，加NT$50可以以套餐加價方式加點用星巴克咖啡豆沖的咖啡。若是商務聚餐是可以考慮用餐的地方。

小路評價：7/12","3.5 stars

At noon, the consumer business package, ordered Korean bibimbap and kimchi pot, there are quite a lot of other products (about seven or eight).

The taste of Korean bibimbap is okay. In terms of Chinese food, the overall weight is sufficient.

The whole kimchi pot tastes good as a whole, the soup is very rich and enough, and the taste tastes very good, but the kimchi pot is slightly less ingredient.

There are three kinds of small dishes (this time there are kimchi, bean sprouts, and half Korean marinated eggs). The side dishes can be added to be encouraged, so that it is Korean food.

The overall decoration is good, the lighting is very trendy, the environment is clean and clean, and the lighting is bright. The conjoined seats in the seat area of ​​the wall are relatively uncomfortable. In addition, the tableware is the highlight, probably the best tableware in the Korean restaurant I have ever eaten.

The price may be slightly higher in general lunch. A commercial package requires an additional service fee for NT $ 229. Plus NT $ 50 can add coffee with starbucks coffee beans with a price increase.If you are a business dinner, you can consider dining.
