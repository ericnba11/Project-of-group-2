At about 9 o'clock in the evening, there are four people. Although the location space in the store is small, the atmosphere and environment inside are very relaxed of hot food smoke flavor.

The most impressive thing is that there is a glass of bartending called pig blood cake. The bartender of pig blood cake is very memorable. The taste of restoring pig blood cake makes me unforgettable this taste. I was also invited two small cups that night that night to make me very happy to drink and thank you at the time.

去過至少10多次，也帶不同朋友去過，但這次令人非常失望，起初我發現店員和調酒師全換了，但餐飲業汰換率本來就很高，所以不以為意
想不到和酒已淪落到會放任店員（還是客人？）騷擾客人還無人管理，店長在哪裏？店經理在哪裏？創辦人引以為傲的服務在哪裏？

（10.15更新）
謝謝老闆回覆，我們是10/1晚上10:30左右去消費的客人，我們喝第二杯時，發現坐在吧台（靠近洗手間）一位身穿綠色上衣的男子，舉起手機對著我們拍照，並且一直對我們比出意義不明的手勢，讓我們感到非常不舒服，因為他一直在跟店員聊天，但並未穿制服，因此我們無法確認他究竟是客人，還是已經下班的員工。
我們去過很多次，一直認為貴店服務很好，可以提供人們放心小酌的環境，在貴店遇到這種事情是第一次，我們對於在貴店消費居然會遇上這樣的騷擾也感到非常意外。

第一次造訪的話，也可以參考牆上的Monthly Top 20與Worst 20，從熱銷的品項開始嘗試。
兩位同事的第一杯都選擇清酒，bartender提供了兩款供選擇。其一是口感較輕盈、有氣泡感並帶香蕉尾韻的，另一是米香濃重、質地渾厚白濁的。
調酒的部分，當晚點用了如下口味，基酒全憑記憶，僅供參考：
烏梅（燒酒）：入口是熟悉的烏梅香氣與酸鹹，尾韻方帶酒氣，口味重但口感輕盈的一款。
爆米花（琴酒）：是甜味爆米花而不是鹹味的，帶有淡淡的焦糖香。
東方美人茶（白蘭地）：位列熱銷榜的前三名。口感與味道都很清爽，作為續攤的第一杯很解膩。
毛豆：bartender說使用了毛豆泥，味道上可以用綠豆沙來想像。做了鹽口杯，喝起來的層次更為豐富，口感也確實有些像綠豆沙牛奶，令人印象深刻的一款。

It's okay, but the protein of a small cup is not enough to solidly bartender, there is a few words and chatter in the middle, but the way he chats is quite embarrassing.
Later, I said that my friend recommended grapefruit Tong Ningshui, but after he was in the reaction of grapefruit Martini, he first rested and gave a clam. Do you want to change it?I am sure that because I just said that I was recommended by my friend, I was sure that I ordered that I ordered the grapefruit Tong Ningshui.

據說他們有超過100種原創雞尾酒，所以無論來多少次都會玩得很開心。
推薦毛豆雞尾酒和Senso果凍雞尾酒。
從馬糕和豬血糕等傳統台灣菜餚到多力多滋、咖哩和爆米花等不尋常的菜餚，從各種各樣的菜單中選擇很有趣。

I visited twice.

No staff member can speak Japanese, but I think they are very friendly, even if you are alone, it is easy to cooperate.

It is said that they have more than 100 original cocktails, so they will play very well no matter how many times they come.
It is recommended that edamame cocktails and Senso jelly cocktails.
From traditional Taiwanese dishes such as horse cakes and pig blood cakes to unusual dishes such as Dorito, curry and popcorn, it is interesting to choose from a variety of menu.

"由於我去的時候已是凌晨零時，客人不算多。這邊營業時間到凌晨兩點，最後點單時間是凌晨一點半。
和酒是屬於清吧類的酒吧，很適合單人前往或三五小友來小酌幾杯，也有提供食物，喝酒喝餓了也不用怕。
單杯價格在$350或以上，就算上加一服務費也是學生都接受的格價。

這邊除了經典調酒和特色調酒，最大的特色就是日本酒和日本精釀啤酒。
這裡的菜單選項頗多，如果有選擇困難症的朋友，還是直接問Bartender比較舒服喔。
要是身邊有日本朋友想念家鄉的味道時，帶過來就對了！

這邊吸引目光的事物真的不是普通的少，除了酒櫃中間的一套科學實驗器材外，就是酒櫃上面的一些自製材料。要是抓對時間詢問Bartender的話，Bartender也會樂意解答的。

一杯是店家以彬木做的特色調酒，基酒是威士忌，入口酒感偏嗆辣，雖然很對本人胃口，但不推非威士忌酒鬼係客人點這杯，如點了還是覺得嗆口或其他的，可以請Bartender幫忙調整。
不過最好的解決方法，當然是在點單時就明確地跟Bartender說明口味了～
另一杯是日本酒月之井，口感溫潤甘甜但酒感紮實，不論男女、酒鬼非酒鬼這杯也很推喔。","Since I was at 00:00 in the morning, there were not many guests.Opening here until two o'clock in the morning, and the last time is at 1:30 in the morning.
Hejiu belongs to the clear bar. It is very suitable for single or three or five friends to have a few drinks. There are also foods that provide food. Do n’t be afraid to drink and drink hungry.
The price of a single cup is $ 350 or above.

In addition to the classic alcohol and special bartending, the biggest feature is Japanese wine and Japanese craft beer.
There are many menu options here. If you have friends with difficulty, you still ask Bartender to be more comfortable.
If there is a Japanese friend who misses the taste of his hometown, it is right to bring it!

What attracts attention here is really not ordinary. In addition to a set of scientific experimental equipment in the middle of the wine cabinet, some homemade materials on the wine cabinet.If you seize the time to ask Bartender, Bartender will be willing to answer it.

A cup is a special bartending made by the store with Binmu. The base wine is whiskey. Others, please ask Bartender to help adjust.

"在去年第一次訪問之後，本週我再次訪問了這個地方，我將回到這裡詳細說明。

如果你跟我一樣是個威士忌愛好者，那就從山崎/響/白州的高球威士忌開始吧。自製的泡泡不會讓你失望。然後，是時候來一杯威士忌了，貨架上全是台灣威士忌，日本的小系列。最後但並非最不重要的一點是，幕後有一些有趣的舊瓶子。 （與調酒師交談😉）

服務也很棒——調酒師都非常友好而且很有禮貌。他們多次檢查過我們。我們沒有機會嘗試這裡的食物，但有一些酒吧小吃可供選擇。另外，我真的很喜歡這裡不太擁擠——台灣人和外國人似乎健康地混合在一起，而且似乎有很多人在約會。 10/10會推薦！","I am very fascinated by this bar -this is a very small bar, providing handmade cocktails featuring Japanese shochu and whiskey.There are a variety of flavors, from standard flavors to surprising flavors -grapefruit, peat cedar, peanut sauce whiskey.Chief bartender said they injected a variety of technologies for each whiskey, and many of them only needed two weeks to make a bottle of whiskey.When you choose the taste of your favorite infusion, they will make custom cocktails to highlight the special taste -I bought grapefruit ginger shochu, they added egg white powder and beat them into this spicy citrus foam.My boyfriend bought honey whiskey, and they smoked it with cherry blossoms.I think some injection is more successful than others, but in general, it is extraordinary concept and excellent execution.

The service is also great -the bartender is very friendly and polite.They have checked us many times.We have no chance to try the food here, but there are some bar snacks to choose from.In addition, I really like it that it is not crowded here -Taiwanese and foreigners seem to be mixed healthily, and there seems to be many people who are dating.10/10 will be recommended!",False,0.154,0.01,0.836,0.9839

雞尾酒似乎進展順利。但看到一位被激怒的日本經理搭訕調酒師真是太痛苦了。供應日本清酒可能很流行，但不要讓這種日本方法落空。所有這些酒吧都一覽無遺。在我來台灣之前我不想看到這種事情，所以無論清酒有多好，我都不確定我是否會再次訪問。","Unfortunately, when we did not drink their original bartending cocktails when we first came, it sounded delicious, but I was not sure if we would come back ...

我還嘗試了很棒的香蕉威士忌和柚子飲料。實際上每杯飲料都非常好，所有的調酒師都非常好。

價格合理，因為混合飲料需要一段時間，但在第二次或第三次喝後，它變得相當昂貴。

I also tried great banana whiskey and grapefruit drinks.In fact, each drink is very good, and all bartenders are very good.
