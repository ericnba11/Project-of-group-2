Ok，到這邊都非常合理，我們也立馬收到桌子下面，沒喝了，並且也都乖乖一人點了一杯飲料（即便是沒有低消飲料的限制）
結果到了結帳前，女店員居然過來告知「因為我們這裡禁帶外食，你們一開始有帶，所以會酌收10%的服務費」
聽到後真是令人傻眼，合情合理哪個店家會收這個錢？我們又不是說你告知了之後不聽勸還一直喝，我們完全沒有，整個完全不合理，不可能店家有缺業績缺到這種程度吧⋯⋯
但我們也付了服務費想說也懶得跟女店員爭執
離開時她還說「垃圾要幫我們帶走」ㄏ⋯⋯我的天啊 真的是夠了
服務費一回事，那女員工態度根本是在挑釁
如果看到這篇文章希望大家不要遇到那個女店員，或是好好的做員工教育，第一次遇到這麼誇張的事情","Because I work nearby, I have already returned to the fifth time when I wrote this comment.
The meal is still quite satisfactory, and the price is not particularly competitive
But now I have to talk about the service attitude of the female clerk
When I entered the door, I had a drink that was not finished, and sat down to order after ordering, ""I'm sorry, we can’t bring food or drink on our side.""
OK, it is very reasonable here. We immediately received under the table, did not drink, and all obediently ordered a drink (even if there is no restriction on low drinks)
As a result, before the checkout, the female clerk actually came over to tell, ""Because we have food forbidden to bring food here, you can bring it at first, so you will charge 10%of the service fee.""
After hearing it, it was really dumbfounded. Which shop will collect this money and reasonableness?We don’t say that you do n’t listen to the persuasion after notifying. We do n’t have it. We do n’t have it. The whole is completely unreasonable. It is impossible for the store to have a lack of performance and lack of this extent.
But we also paid the service fee and wanted to say that they were too lazy to argue with the female clerk
When she left, she also said, ""The garbage should help us take it away.""
When the service fee is the case, the attitude of the female employee is at all provoking

個人認為一間餐廳販賣食物給客人好不好吃是其次，每個人口味各有所好，但環境衛生、食物安全不是基本中的基本嗎？看到下面留言就可以知道環境髒亂及蟑螂的問題，且店家並無心處理，也只會回應客人「半開放式的空間就是會有這種情況發生」，好像兩手一攤就事不關己。

7月中的平日晚上到此用餐，店外裝潢很有風格，店內座位比較狹小，不過許多居酒屋也是這樣的空間安排，就不以為意。但一進到店內有聞到一股有點像油耗味的味道，不太確定原因是什麼，倒是坐一陣子就習慣了...另外到訪時間是夏天，店內的冷氣滿不涼的，邊吃邊聊邊冒汗，怕熱的人可能要注意，我們則是很快就離開換有冷氣的地方。餐點的部分當天有點雞翅、雞肉串、五花肉、烤飯糰、及其他蔬菜菇類，基本上肉烤得不差，不會太老或太硬，但調味很無趣沒有驚艷，只吃得到胡椒粉味，老實說稱不上特別美味，加分的部分是上菜速度很快、地點方便。,"Dining here on weekdays in mid -July, the outside of the shop is very stylish, and the seats in the store are relatively small, but many izakaya also has such a space arrangement, and it is not intentional.But once I entered the store, I smelled a bit like fuel consumption.

"我去的地方有舒適的氛圍、美味的食物和清酒。
自製清酒很便宜，燒烤食物絕對是我在酒吧吃過的最好的食物，因為他們通常會煮過頭或只是在食物上加鹽（所以你可以點更多的啤酒來沖淡鹹味）。
