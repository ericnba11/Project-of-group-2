"昨天晚上經過好幾次都想去的榕錦園區，
才剛過紅綠燈就看到有個機車格很寬敞，
想著「這不就是邀請我停車的嗎？」，
心動不如馬上行動，停了車就從路口開始走走拍拍。

越走越喜歡，台北還是有這樣的一個園區，
在夜晚有種遺世獨立的感覺，這是好幾年前華山才有的FU，
現在華山人多，已經找不到當初的寧靜感了⋯

原本沒打算吃晚餐的，
但走道了居餃屋，覺得好特別，
餐點份量跟價格也都在能接受範圍，
決定讓自己在週二晚上chill一下。

一進餐廳就有服務人員熱情招呼，
是個日式居酒屋但西式經營的風格，
主打臺灣先釀啤酒，但我騎車，
所以不點酒精飲料。

菜單很簡單，食物多為簡單下酒菜，
但結合台日飲食風格。

像是煎餃、水餃，咖喱飯、雞肉飯，還有酒吧常見的炸雞，但還有日式烤糰子、傻瓜乾麵等，一般酒吧不常見的食物蠻有自己的特色的。

餐點：高麗菜煎餃、肉桂糖霜餃子皮、柚子可爾必思。

肉桂糖霜餃子皮完全是我的愛，螞蟻人還要求加糖粉😜
服務人員也很貼心幫我處理了，
煎餃很酥脆，一口大小果然就是下酒用的。
柚子可爾必思我點正常冰，但覺得偏甜了。

環境：很乾淨，也很有酒吧的氣氛，晚上外國人也不少，會有種置身國外的錯覺感。

有機會會再回訪的～","The Rongjin Park, which I wanted to go several times last night,
Just after passing the traffic light, I saw a locomotive very spacious,
Think about ""Isn't this invited me to park?"",,, ""
The heart is not as good as acting immediately, and the car starts from the intersection.

The more you like, the more you like it, there is still such a park in Taipei,
There is a feeling of independence in the world at night.
Now there are many people in Huashan, I can’t find my original tranquility ...

I didn't plan to have dinner,
But the aisle is in the dumpling house, it feels so special,
The amount and price of meals can also be acceptable.
Decide to let yourself Chill on Tuesday night.

As soon as you enter the restaurant, you will have the service staff enthusiastically,
It is a Japanese -style izakaya but Western -style operation.
It focuses on Taiwan first brewing beer, but I ride a bike,
So do not order alcoholic drinks.

The menu is very simple, and the food is mostly simple.
But combined with the Taiwan -day diet style.

Such as fried dumplings, dumplings, curry rice, chicken rice, and fried chicken common in bars, but there are Japanese roasted balls, fools, etc. The common foods that are not common in bars have their own characteristics.

Meals: Kaga vegetable fried dumplings, cinnamon frost dumplings, grapefruit cosmi.

Cinnamon frosting dumpling skin is my love at all, ants also ask for sugar powder 😜
The service staff also helped me handle it,
The fried dumplings are crispy, and the size of a bite is really used for wine.
Grapefruit is normally ice, but feels sweet.

Environment: It is clean and there is a bar atmosphere. There are many foreigners at night, and there will be an illusion of being in foreign countries.

I will return to visit again ~",False

"臺虎精釀旗下啜飲室，每家裝璜設計各不相同，也曾多次造訪，留存印像中一直是啤酒大大優於餐點。位於金華街啜飲室，是由古蹟修復後的日式建築，取名居餃屋，顧名思義主打煎餃跟水餃，網路對煎餃評價也還不錯，就特別前往一試。

到了差點找不到大門進入，一進門坐定點了韮菜豬肉煎餃，一上桌餃子個頭不大，嘴大者可一口一個。煎餃覺得不是油煎，倒比較像是油炸。外皮相當乾硬，遠大於酥脆，內餡調味還可以不過鹹，口味重點可沾上醬油。啤酒是金桔拉格，單純麥香加上金桔香氣，去除啤酒苦味，喝來清爽無比，無庸置疑還是維持一貫水準 。

"在榕錦時光中探訪了一家略有不同於大家熟悉的居酒屋，對這次的用餐體驗感到相當滿意。這家居酒屋雖然餐點不多，但其中的炸物與煎餃絕對是美味的代表，絕對值得品味，而且非常適合下酒。

"點了兩份煎餃（高麗菜跟韭菜各一）、一杯精釀、一碗咖哩飯、一顆可樂餅。

煎餃實在不推薦，其中一份焦黑成這樣還可以端上來，不知道負責出餐的人以及送餐的服務生在想什麼。煎餃普通到，高麗菜跟韭菜吃起來幾乎都差不多，沒有記憶點。

精釀就是台虎的那個樣子，環境不錯，空間氛圍很好，但餐點真的偏雷。

既然是希望用餐酒配搭來強化自家精釀，食物也要有水準之上才行，沒有辦法1+1>2 ，或是至少做到不要失分，但東門的啜飲室反而還幫原本的酒類產品扣分。

綜合起來，如果不是特別有約，我會更傾向自己抓一瓶超商買的到的精釀，然後外帶好吃又便宜的煎餃回家，在家邊吃邊看劇，體驗更好。","Ordered two fried dumplings (one each one each), a cup of crafts, a bowl of curry rice, and a cola cake.

Fried dumplings are really not recommended. One of them can also be brought up. I do n’t know what the person in charge of the meal and the waiter who deliver meals is thinking.Fried dumplings are ordinary, and Kaga cuisine is almost the same as chives, and there is no memory point.

The craft is the same as Taiwanese tiger. The environment is good and the atmosphere of the space is very good, but the meal is really lightning.

Since I hope to use meals and wine to strengthen their own crafts, the food must be above the level. There is no way to 1+1> 2, or at least do it. Deduction of alcohol products.

這次點了高麗菜跟韭菜煎餃，都是偏重口味的，配酒很適合，單吃可能會覺得過鹹。

起司可樂餅好吃，那個爆漿太美味了。

醬油糰子因為是現烤的，熱騰騰的比那種冷掉的好吃很多，鹹鹹甜甜的。

咖哩飯的部分那個蛋黃很特別，有小黃瓜很貼心，不過吃起來還是偏乾一點，可能飯的問題？ 覺得普普。

The cheese Coca -Cola cake is delicious, and the burst slurry is too delicious.

Because the soy sauce ball is grilled, it is much hotter than that kind of cold and delicious, salty and sweet.

The egg yolk part of the curry rice is very special. There is a small cucumber very intimate, but it is still a bit dry. Maybe the problem of rice?I think Pop.

這家酒吧是位於台北市中心的一顆令人愉悅的寶石，距離東門捷運站僅 5-10 分鐘步行路程。這裡的氛圍確實非常出色，與既不太響亮也不太柔和的音樂達到了完美的平衡，提供了 J-hip hop 和 RnB 的愉快組合，非常適合放鬆身心。這裡的氛圍很吸引人，讓您一走進去就感到輕鬆自在。

Taihu Gyoza Bar 的服務一流，讓您感到賓至如歸。雖然食物很不錯，只夠滿足，但又不會太特別，但價格、服務和氛圍的結合讓這個地方值得再次光顧。儘管餃子是他們的特色菜，但對我來說最出色的是檸檬麗莎水果艾爾啤酒，其甜味和酒精含量為 9.99%。一大杯讓您微醺，非常適合輕鬆入睡。總的來說，這是我期待再去的地方！

這是一家白天營業的酒吧，在可愛的日式餐廳區，氣氛很好，很熱鬧，適合四處走走，看看各種商店。還有炸雞，不過推薦的飲料是圖中的飲料，我不知道叫什麼。我不記得名字了。但它很好吃。,"This is a bar opened during the day. In the cute Japanese -style restaurant area, the atmosphere is very good and lively. It is suitable for walking around to see various shops.There is also fried chicken, but the recommended drink is the drink in the picture, I don't know what it is.I don't remember the name.But it is delicious.",False
好吃～好吃,Delicious ~ delicious,False
"裡面有站立空間，外面有一個有椅子的櫃檯。空間提供精釀啤酒和小吃（餃子、槌球、炸雞等）

是個喝一杯和吃點東西的好地方，但沒有什麼可以滿足整個胃口。食物需要一些精煉，因為它太鹹了而且沒有真正的亮點。生啤酒的選擇很好，啤酒的餘韻還有待提升。

整體來說是一個與朋友聚會的好空間，但主要以飲料為主，食物是次要的。","There is a standing space inside, and there is a counter with a chair outside.Space provides craft beer and snacks (dumplings, mallets, fried chicken, etc.)

It is a good place to drink a drink and eat something, but nothing can satisfy the whole appetite.Food requires some refined because it is too salty and there is no real highlight.The choice of raw beer is very good, and the remaining charm of beer needs to be improved.

Overall is a good space to meet with friends, but it is mainly beverages, and food is secondary.",False
