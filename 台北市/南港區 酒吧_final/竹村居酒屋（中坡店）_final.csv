今天與朋友定位8:30，約8:10到，到的時候剛好同時進場2~3組，一次性的點完餐後第一道菜蛋捲出很快，但吃完蛋捲後等了快一個小時才吃到其他串物，串物上桌後還有三道沒上（透抽、玉米筍、雞皮）。等待時（離蛋捲上完約莫過30分鐘）有詢問店員怎麼那麼久，店員也沒問是哪桌就直接回答在烤盤上烤了。吃完串物後又等，真的有點受不了去問店員，跟他反應等待過久的問題，他一臉就是不耐煩懶得解釋的臉，只說烤物比較多她們爐子有限等等。這些理由其實我跟朋友是接受的，但是他的態度實在是讓人不敢恭維。後來隔壁加點的透抽跟我們的一開始點的透抽同時上的時候我們一臉莫名其妙。接著再次去詢問玉米筍得到的答案是已經在烤箱烤了，但因為這餐實在是吃太久了，朋友待會還有事，就決定打包離開。至櫃台結帳時他說：「你們還有雞皮沒上喔。」「不是還有玉米筍嗎？」結果她一臉問號翻了單子說我們沒點，我跟他強調我們一開始就有點他一臉你騙誰啊的臉就算了，中間我去問玉米筍好了沒的時候你說在烤箱烤了是回達心酸的？最後因為沒算到錢也就直接請他幫忙打包了，打包拿來時也是一臉臭臉，謝謝不好意思抱歉等禮貌性用語都沒說，今晚的服務真的讓人非常的不滿意。這家的東西好吃，但今天的服務員真的是很不好，跟之前去的幾次的用餐經驗相比真的差了非常多。,"Positioning with friends at 8:30 today, John 8:10 arrived, just entered the field at the same time at the same time, and the first vegetable egg rolled out after one -time ordering, but after eating the egg rolls It was only an hour to eat other skewers.

前幾天帶著朋友，
跟嚷嚷著要吃日本串燒店的女友，
當時在Google日本料理，
找到了這家，
看評價還不錯才去吃 ，
結果消費用餐的過程我只能給一顆星，
每一樣菜都小小的，像煙灰缸大小就算了，
我們從頭到尾，點了七八樣，
不好吃就算了，
重點是！肉串的部份像橡皮筋一樣，
咬都咬不斷，
咬到到最後都直接吐在煙灰缸裡面！
最誇張的是，上菜的速度！
不誇張！
大部分時間你會發現都是在等，等，等
我們最後幾道菜兩三道菜甚至是點餐完一個多小時才送到桌上（重點是店內只坐了一半的人）
我們隔壁桌兩個不認識的大叔也是，
看他們手推在下巴地等，
期間還到櫃檯催促了兩次，
看他們的表情真的很不耐煩，
然後我女朋友一直叫我不要生氣，
他說就算了，以後不要來就好了，
我真的覺得對這家店很失望，
而且也讓我很丟臉，
那天女朋友下班整天沒吃東西、
好不容易找到一間他一直想吃的日式串燒，
結果最後因為肉太硬吃沒幾口，
也等得太久，
然後沒有生啤酒也沒有生魚片這些我們都可以接受，

From beginning to end, we ordered seven or eight,
It's not delicious,

Bite the bite and bite constantly,
Twitted in the ashtray in the end!

No exaggeration!

Our last few dishes, two or three dishes, or even a meal for more than an hour to send it to the table (the point is that only half of the people in the store)
The two uncle who did not know the table next door, too,
See they push their hands in the chin, etc.
During the period, I went to the counter twice,
Seeing their expression is really impatient,
Then my girlfriend always told me not to be angry,
Even if he said, just don't come in the future,
I really feel disappointed with this shop,
And it also made me embarrassed,
My girlfriend did not eat all day that day,
After finally finding a Japanese skewers he always wanted to eat,
In the end, because the meat was too hard to eat a few mouthfuls,
Wait too long,
Then we can accept no beer or raw fish fillets.
