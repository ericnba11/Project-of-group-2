"第一次來Lobby Lounge就給了這個豪吃之夜，燒烤美牛板腱放題/佐田納西威士忌醬。

拖了一年才成行，中間這個吃到飽活動換了好幾代，錯過菲力之後，看到田納西威士忌醬終於又燃起一點興趣。

規則很簡單，牛排、格子薯、汽水是可以續的，美式高麗菜沙拉、培根🥓、甜玉米則是單是供應。本來是沒有特別期待肉質，但當天晚上牛排烤的意外的好，沒吃過那麼嫩口的，只能說各方面真的都是剛剛好，醬也不錯，來來回回大概吃了三塊，都有一定水準（很巧妙的最後一塊最好吃）

其他配菜除了格子薯略鹹、有點普通，培根與甜玉米稍冷但都很好吃，汽水的部分可以供應冰塊🧊還蠻不錯的。

附帶一提，第一位服務員神奇的丟下汽水跟吸管就走，讓我有點意外 ，但我沒說什麼。之後我們跟她要了冰塊之後，意外的來了一位服務極為優異、也非常優雅的服務員，後半段真的是挺開心的。

結尾點了杯Daiquiri, 各方面中規中矩, 有一流飯店大堂酒吧的水準。","The first time I came to Lobby Lounge, I gave this good night.

It took a year before it was done. In the middle of this full -time activity, I changed for several generations. After missing Fili, I saw that the Tennessee whiskey sauce finally ignited a little bit of interest.

The rules are very simple. Steak, grid potato, and soda are continuing. American cabbage salads, bacon, and sweet corn are supplying alone.Originally, I did n’t particularly look forward to the meat quality, but the beef steak was unexpectedly good that night. I have n’t eaten so tender. I can only say that all aspects are really just right, and the sauce is good. I ate about three pieces back and forth. There are a certain level (very clever last piece is the best)

Except for the grid potato slightly salty and a bit ordinary, the bacon and sweet corn are slightly cold but delicious. The part of the soda can supply ice cubes. It is pretty good.

With a mention, the first waiter left the soda and left with the straw, which surprised me, but I didn't say anything.After we asked her for the ice, we unexpectedly came a very good and elegant waiter. The second half was really happy.

At the end, I ordered a cup of Daiquiri, which is quite satisfactory in all aspects.",0.236,0.006,0.758,0.9965
波隆那番茄牛肉醬義大利麵、手沖咖啡、提拉米蘇都只能說中規中矩，沒有驚喜沒有記憶點，一樣的餐點跟一般餐廳口味差不多或更弱，但價位卻貴上不少。用餐環境很舒適，但在靠窗這區服務生幾乎不會走過來，會出現只有送餐及客人離開時清桌子，永遠都是低著頭做自己的事，然後悶著頭離開，有事需要幫忙又不想大叫，就只能站起來自己去找人，有點糟糕。,"Polona tomato and beef sauce Italian noodles, hand -coffee coffee, and Tiramisu can only be said to be quite satisfactory. There are no surprises and no memory points. The same meal is similar to that of ordinary restaurants. EssenceThe dining environment is very comfortable, but the waiters in the window of the window will hardly come over.

"肋眼吃到飽真的感覺還好，純不推這個活動，牛排有點太難咬也有點單調。
能夠無限加點的只有牛排本體，馬鈴薯泥，烤番茄跟約克夏布丁，酥皮湯（不是玉米濃湯）跟沙拉很好吃但只有一開始會上一份而已。","The rib eye feels good when it is full. If you do n’t push this activity, the steak is a bit too difficult to bite and a bit monotonous.
The only steak body, potato puree, roasted tomato and Jokerxine pudding, plasma soup (not corn soup) is delicious but only one of the first.",0.077,0.031,0.892,0.3716
"午餐時間來參加漢堡節的活動，感覺服務人力不足，所以每位服務人員都很忙碌。主要接待的小姐，可能因為忙不過來，所以服務態度欠佳。

以這價格裡的單價，大家還是有很多地方可以去的，只是可惜了漢堡還是不錯吃的。","Come to participate in the Burger Festival activities at lunch time, and feel that the service manpower is insufficient, so each service staff is busy.The main reception ladies may not be busy, so the service attitude is poor.

At this price, there are still many places to go, but it is a pity that burgers are still good.",0.092,0.075,0.833,0.2732

麵包烤得偏硬，沒有法國麵包該有的外脆內鬆軟，然後放了一個安佳奶油在旁邊，連抹刀都沒有，現在改當我在星巴克了嗎？

濃湯稍微特別一點是栗子泥濃湯。

本來想說服自己可能這張餐券重點就是主餐吧，所以前菜才這麽隨便，沒有，大錯特錯。

主餐一上來一堆血水在旁邊，血水還把烤蔬菜全部泡濕，肉也超級薄，我完全看不出來這是肋眼牛排，整塊肉的熟度都不均勻，外面熟透了裡面卻很生。

出餐速度也讓我很不滿意，前面很急著把生菜沙拉、麵包、湯品送上來，桌子都塞滿了還硬要放，主餐卻等很久才上，而且期間店員也不太會幫你收餐盤，我們主餐吃完很久了也不收，離開了的客人都走一陣子了，也不見服務生有要把它收走。

The bread is baked hard, and there is no crispy inside of the French bread. Then put an Anjia cream next to it, not even the knife. Is it now on Starbucks?

The soup is slightly a bit special is chestnut mud soup.

"在萬豪裡面，擁有寬敞挑高的環境，大片落地窗陽光充足，戶外也綠意盎然，怕熱的也有不曬到太陽的地方，用餐環境十分宜人。

簡餐部分：
半筋半肉牛肉麵，粗麵條也Q彈略有嚼勁，湯濃但略鹹要是能稍微減點鹹度那就更好了，牛肉肉質軟嫩令人驚艷。
烤松阪豬肉飯，比較中規中矩，不難吃，但也沒令人驚艷之處。

排骨飯，排骨厚實炸的外皮酥脆，內部肉質軟嫩多汁，非常不錯。

辣烤雞翅，這道非常普通，口感類似微波食品，加以蔬菜擺盤。建議可省略

以上兩種飯都是採用肉燥飯，肉燥有瘦有肥，對於不敢吃肥肉的人會有點排斥，但勉強入口後發現別有滋味，意外滑順好入口，原來肥瘦的比例掌握是如此重要，肉燥的肉質也是。

服務也專業到位，給予肯定。

若真要挑個項目來說嘴，大概就是價錢不親民。牛肉麵意一碗將近600，搭配一杯果汁250(叫餐折50)，在10%服務費就將近900元，排骨飯和松阪豬肉飯單點也都要五百多。但本來就在五星萬豪酒店裡，心裡早知道它貴，就為了方便省時，自己的選擇也只能認了。","In Marriott, there is a spacious and high environment.

The above two kinds of rice are dried rice, and the meat is thin and fat. It will be a bit rejected by those who dare not eat fat, but I barely find that there is no taste after the entrance. It is so important, as well as dry meat.

The service is also professional and gives affirmation.

另外我比較好奇的是，萬豪酒店基本上沒把日本客人設定為主客群之一嗎，飯店的櫃台日文完全不通，詢問後得到的答案是會日文的員工並不會每天都在，這樣的五星級飯店在台灣還真不多見……

就連room service也全要求英文，且大門口的接待員日文不通也就算了，我完全沒歧視外勞的意思，但也不要找那麼多連中文溝通都有困難的接待員吧。下雨天要借個傘還只能用英文溝通，就算英語是國際語言，且日文不通也就算了，大門口的服務生有好幾個居然連最基本的中文都不通……","The taste of the meal is average.

In addition, I am more curious that the Marriott Hotel has basically not set Japanese guests as one of the main customers. The Japanese counter Japanese is completely unreasonable. Five -star hotels are really rare in Taiwan ...

Even Room Service requires all English, and the receptionist at the gate is not in Japanese.

"衝著萬豪推出牛排吃到飽一人不到千元活動而來，以大飯店來說這活動相當吸引人！

到現場後，服務人員帶我入座後，拿了一本menu來後說：「牛排吃到飽只有牛排，水和飲料及其他餐點都要另外點。」然後她就飄走了！就飄走了！就飄走了！非常傻眼所以要說三次，我們坐在那邊大概等了5分鐘，一直找不到服務生，沒人幫忙點飲料也不知道牛排要自取還是會送到座位上，走到牛排區詢問服務人員才說會送到桌上。

再等了3分鐘牛排送上來了！但沒有鹽跟胡椒，我看到別桌都有，才詢問說可不可以給我們鹽跟胡椒，後來才補上。吃完之後因為要等服務人員補，服務人員數量明顯不足，也常常飄走，需要招手加眼神交會個兩三次，服務人員終於過來，才可以續牛排，又然後看到服務人員拿著蘑菇醬逐桌詢問要不要加醬才知道原來還有蘑菇醬呢！

又後來看到別桌可以續牛排的配菜炒菇與馬鈴薯泥，才舉手說拜託幫我們續！

最後離開要結帳要打包都要不斷的看著服務人員等待他跟妳眼神交會的那一刻，才有機會把服務人員召喚過來！

雖然是便宜的促銷活動，但整體的用餐體驗非常差，我想我不會再去第二次，多一顆星是配菜的品質跟單點的薯條跟炸中卷品質不錯！

貴為五星級酒店，不論推出什麼樣的活動，給顧客好的服務應該是基本的，如果因為價格而服務打折影響品牌形象，真心建議不如不要推出自砸招牌的負面行銷活動！","I came to the launch of the steak to eat a full person who was full of less than 1,000 yuan. For the big hotel, this activity was quite attractive!

After arriving at the scene, after the service staff took me into the seat, I took a Menu and said, ""The steak is full of steaks, and the water, drinks and other meals must be separated."" Then she drifted away!Just drift away!Just drift away!Very dumbfounded so I have to say three times. We sat there for about 5 minutes. We couldn't find the waiter. No one helped to order drinks and did not know that the steak would be taken to the seat. The personnel said that they would send it to the table.

After waiting for another 3 minutes, the steak was delivered!But without salt and pepper, I saw that there were other tables, and I asked if I could give us salt and pepper, but later made up.After eating the service staff, the number of service personnel is obviously insufficient, and often floats away. You need to show off two or three times with your eyes. The service staff finally comes over to renew the steak. Then you can see the service staff holding mushroom sauce. Ask you to ask if you want to add sauce to know that there is still mushroom sauce!

Later, I saw the side dishes and potato puree that could continue the steak, and then raised my hand and said to help us continue!

Finally, when you leave, you have to watch the service staff waiting for him to wait for him to meet with your eyes.

Although it is a cheap promotional activity, the overall meal experience is very poor. I don't think I will go to the second time. One more star is the quality of side dishes and a single -point fries and fried roll quality.

國慶連假入住台北萬豪。

於入住前一天10/08訂房，後來發現搞錯日期結果早了一天，但因為飯店在訂房後的半小時內APP就顯示升套，說什麼也得去體驗一下套房。

住宿：由於是套房，空間只有大而已，很喜歡沙發、廁所的TOTO馬桶與床，真的很好睡！

服務：人員服務方面，由於是第一次入住，酒廊人員非常有耐心解說，還記得叫Julia Yang，也於APP上稱讚她，感謝讓我有好的入住體驗。

健身房：飯店健身房都沒人，器材品質非常好，而且還不會有人問你還剩幾組要做ㄎㄎ

Service: In terms of personnel services, because it was the first time to stay, the lounge staff had a very patient explanation. Remember to call Julia yang, and praised her on the app, thanks for making me have a good check -in experience.

"購買平日牛排吃到飽餐券(前菜沙拉，洋蔥湯，飲料，薯條(可續)，牛排(可續))

優點：
1. 前菜沙拉跟薯條不錯
2. 服務人員態度很好(但基本的服務細節(甚至不是細節基本觀念)很差，明顯沒受過相關訓練，等缺點統一講)
3. 環境很好

缺點：
1. 牛排品質非常參差不齊，明顯拿到是不同品質的肉，品質差的時候令人難以想像，牛肉完全沒斷筋，整塊牛肉跟橡皮筋一樣，完全嚼不爛，切也切不斷，還要用吞的才能吃下去，肉又老又柴非常難吃，有時候又端出正常的菲力牛排，火侯控制的又很好，外皮鎖住肉汁，完全沒筋，內部完美的3分熟牛排，這是這個價位拿出的品管?完全看不懂，前面那種品質的東西還敢拿出來賣?

2. 服務人員奇怪的基本觀念
● 這個價位服務人員連基本的換刀叉都不會，第一道前菜沙拉用的餐具直接延續到後面吃薯條跟吃牛排，怎樣不想洗餐具?還是你們的餐具金子做的怕客人咬壞?前菜沙拉的醬的風味直接保留到牛排一起享用，很棒。
● 薯條送來不會提供基本分食的餐盤，還要顧客自己提需求才會提供，不講就不提供，所以分的薯條要放在哪呢放在洋蔥湯裡面吃還是?放在牛排餐盤裡?還是用手抓著吃，然後再拿刀切牛排?
● 薯條跟牛排可以續，但在送餐過程中完全沒有提及，還要自己去問吃到飽的續餐是哪些部分，整個莫名其妙
● 送完餐點完全沒說餐點送齊了提醒顧客，還要自己去問所以這是最後的一道菜了嗎
我是不知道這邊是根本沒在教基本的觀念還是什麼的，送完餐點說餐點到齊，連路邊小吃攤都會做的事情這邊就是沒有，這是萬豪酒店的服務嗎

3. 桌子過矮用餐非常的不舒服，要彎的非常下來，才能吃到餐點

總結：如果這家店是用相對便宜的餐券(也沒便宜到哪)，去吸引顧客回流，抱歉，這樣的品質，服務完全做不到，完全的一次店(如果你想踩雷的話，那就去試一次吧)。","Buy a full meal coupon (front dish salad, onion soup, drink, fries (can be continued), steak (can be continued))

advantage:
1. The former vegetable salad and the fries are good
2. The service staff attitude is very good (but the basic service details (even not even the basic concept of details) are very poor, obviously not subject to related training, such as unified shortcomings)
3. Good environment

shortcoming:
1. The quality of the steak is very different. It is obvious that it is different of the meat of different quality. It is difficult to imagine when the quality is poor. The beef has no broken tendons at all. The whole piece of beef is the same as rubber bands. , You have to eat it with swallowing. The meat is old and hard -won. Sometimes the normal Fili steak is brought out, and the fire is controlled well. 3 points cooked steak. This is the quality tube taken from this price? I can't understand it at all. The quality of the previous quality dares to sell it?

2. Strange basic concepts of service staff
● This price service personnel will not even change the basic knife and fork. The first tableware used for the former vegetable salad will continue to eat fries and steaks. How can I not want to wash the tableware? Or your tableware gold is afraid of the guests to bite the guests. • The flavor of the salad salad can be reserved directly until the steak is great.
● French fries that will not provide basic food dishes that will not provide basic foods. Customers need to provide their own needs to provide them. If you do n’t talk about it, do you do it? In the steak dinner plate? Or hold it with your hands, and then cut the steak with a knife?
● French fries and steaks can be renewed, but they are not mentioned during the meal delivery process. I have to ask what part of the meal that is full. The whole is inexplicable.
● I did n’t say that the meal was given after the meal, and I reminded the customers, so I have to ask myself, so is this the last dish?
I do n’t know what the basic concept or what is the basic concept or what is it? After the meal is delivered, the meal is Qi, and even the roadside snack stalls will do.

3. The table is very uncomfortable for dwarf meals. You have to bend very well before you can eat meals.

Summary: If this store uses relatively cheap meal coupons (not cheap) to attract customers to return, sorry, such quality and service are completely unable to do it, a complete shop (if you want to step on the mine, you want to step on the mine, Then try it once).",0.07,0.059,0.871,0.765

再來, 這邊5個人, 訂了6人座位, 但桌子高度坐下來只有到腰部, 想跟服務員換座位, 對方表示沒有其他可以容納5個人的座位了, 這桌子高度實在無法用餐, 因為我們是去吃該餐廳的正餐而非點心, 最後看到有4人座的客人離開, 去問一下 才讓我們換到4人座位上去 其中一個人坐桌子的角落, 如果沒有正常坐位 請別讓我們訂位成功, 畢竟餐廳並不是當時並不是只有提供下午茶, 還有其他正餐可以點

啤酒很冷，食物價格也很合理。但它作為餐廳經營，如果你沒有預訂桌子，即使這個地方顯然是空的，總是會大驚小怪。更糟的是，吃飯時不能免費喝一杯水：花1000元買啤酒，400元買食物，他們還是不給你一杯水。,"Beer is cold and the price of food is reasonable.But it operates as a restaurant.

我很沮喪，因為不是每個人都吃動物器官。伺服器既沒有告訴我提供內臟，也沒有在選單上顯示。
