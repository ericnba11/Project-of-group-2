"因為有餐券吃了兩次，但覺得體驗上不值得花錢
Live band演出我覺得就隨便找個空間，請個表演者演奏，音場很差vibe聽久了其實不是很舒服。

人員服務有待加強，感覺做的不是很情願也辛苦他們了，服務只是送餐但也沒有感覺比較好，收10%服務費也是收到公司手裡，教育訓練做不好不如不要收。

餐點部分牛肉麵口味還算可以，但價格330元我認為偏高，義大利麵、墨式薄餅不建議點。","Because I have a meal coupon twice, I feel that the experience is not worth spending money
I think the live band shows a space. Please perform a space. Please perform a performer. The sound field is very poor for a long time. It is not very comfortable.

Personnel services have to be strengthened. I feel that I do n’t want to do it and work hard. The service is just delivery but it does n’t feel better. The service fee of 10%also receives the company's hands.

"今天9/9號晚上約19:00入住
突然有位女士插隊很不客氣跟客服小姐發標
一見面就說要見經理 我想說是什麼大事
該不會跟評價說的一樣讓我第一次入住的蠻心驚膽跳的
結果仔細聽完之後才知道是個澳洲來的客人
而當天的經理也很衰還要讓他飆罵
凱達大飯店無論是訂房網站還是官網上都有特別註明（停車塔先來先停）不知道是不是眼睛瞎了
而飆罵的原因當然也是停車塔的問題
他說他等了一個小時都沒有車位可以停
難道你們飯店就是這樣處理，我聽了當下心裡想飯店提供免費停車在台北市寸土寸金的地方已經算佛心了，自己晚到沒車位停 怎麼可以怪飯店處理方式有問題？
而且房價也不貴也不包含停車位只是提供了住宿客戶一個貼心的服務卻因為這個貼心服務而被罵得滿頭包真心覺得這個客人真的非常沒水準
而有來台北玩的人也都知道台北很多飯店並不包含停車位這樣還在抱怨
而凱達好不好我的感想是真的還不錯而9/9號晚上19:00多的經理跟櫃檯人員服務態度都非常得好給當時的經理跟櫃檯人員大大一個讚 老闆這要加薪啊
小弟在此給凱達大飯店大大一個讚👍
雖然打電話都沒有人 真的也沒辦法人太多太忙","Check in at John 19:00 on the evening of 9/9 today
Suddenly a lady was very polite to send a bid with the customer service lady
As soon as I met, I said that I want to see the manager. What is the big deal?
It’s not the same as the evaluation that made my first check -in.
As a result, after careful listening, I learned that it was a guest from Australia
And the manager of the day was also very declining and let him scold him
Kaida Hotel has special indications whether it is a booking website or the official website (the parking tower is stopped first) I don’t know if the eyes are blind.
The reason for the scolding is of course the problem of the parking tower
He said he waited for an hour without parking space to stop
Is this this way your restaurant is dealt with. I listened to the place where the restaurant was free to park freely in Taipei. How can I blame the hotel to deal with the restaurant?
Moreover, house prices are not expensive or include parking spaces. They only provide a intimate service of accommodation customers, but they are scolded because of this intimate service.
Some people who come to Taipei also know that many restaurants in Taipei do not include parking spaces.
And Kaida's feelings are really good, and the manager and counter personnel service attitude of more than 19:00 on the 9/9 on 9/9 are very good for the manager and counter staff at the time.

"到現場完全沒有服務員，要跑到隔壁自助區找服務員詢問才有人過來，中間看到其他不知情的客人走進酒吧我看他坐在那邊快15分以上都沒人服務他（這邊服務費收10%）。

漢堡沒有使用漢堡排裏面夾的感覺是隔壁自主吃到飽的牛肉切塊（而且感覺是切剩的部分，七成都白色油脂部位），起司拼盤內容八成都是隔天早餐自助餐看得到的廉價食材，但以上價位都是跟外面酒吧一樣貴…（300多加一成服務費）。
