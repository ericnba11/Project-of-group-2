"店內裝修感覺上像是走文青工業風的小酒館，但是除了有賣各種精釀啤酒，餐點主要卻是打著牛肉麵料理的招牌；麵點類表現上還算中規中矩；麵條是Q度不錯的拉麵，，牛肉用的是品質不錯的滷牛腱切塊，燉煮的非常軟嫩，意外好吃；湯頭雖然有些平淡，但也算是甘甜不膩；重點是如果可吃重口味的人，在加了店家特製的牛油（微辣）後，味道明顯提升了一個層次,香氣十足，相當推薦。各式加熱滷味還算不差，吃辣的人可以搭配上特調的辣椒醬，雖然不是太辣但香味加分很多；各式精釀啤酒，可以請店家推薦，選項相當多，只是價格不是相當便宜，要暢飲可能有些問題....排除酒類來說，個人認為餐點的CP值其實還不差了。

我跟朋友是點3號及7號啤酒，7號的話喝起來味道比較重而散發出來的香氣（不確定是水果還是花香）非常自然，是種喝了不膩值得一試的啤酒。至於3號我認為比較適合不常喝啤酒的人，因為3號啤酒的味道比較淡但當季釀出的啤酒確實喝起來順口，如果沒那麼喜歡啤酒的人也是值得一試的選擇。至於餐點的部分我們只點滷味，但配上精釀啤酒來說吃起來有點不搭不過並不影響滷味本身的味道，滷味本身味道不錯如果要配酒的話一般的啤酒就行了，精釀的比較適合單喝和朋友一起慢慢享受，店內的裝潢也不錯 ，缺點大概就是店員介紹啤酒的音量比較小聲，如果能大聲一點更多自信去推廣店內的特色啤酒應該會讓客人比較明確知道該點什麼種類的(介紹前有問比較常喝哪種啤酒這點挺不錯的)，晚上如果想找人聊聊天會是不錯的場所，店內好像也有進無酒精的飲料，如果有不想喝酒但想享受喝酒氛圍的感覺的人也是個不錯的選擇，有機會應該會會在再次光臨。,"I and my friends are beer on the 3rd and 7th. On the 7th, the taste of the taste of the taste is relatively natural (not sure whether it is fruit or flower fragrance). It is very natural. It is a beer that is not greasy to drink.As for No. 3, I think it is more suitable for people who do not drink beer often, because the taste of No. 3 beer is lighter, but the beer breed in the season is indeed drinking smoothly. If you do n’t like beer so much, it is worth trying.As for the meal part, we only order Payon, but with the craft beer, it tastes a bit, but it does not affect the taste of the fingwei itself. It is more suitable for drinking with friends to enjoy slowly. The decoration of the store is also good. The disadvantage is that the staff introduced the volume of the beer. If you can loudly to promote the special beer in the store What kind of type (what kind of beer is often drinking before the introduction), it will be good places if you want to find someone to chat at night. There seems to be no alcoholic drinks in the store. People who feel at the atmosphere of drinking are also a good choice, and they should come again if they have a chance.",False

和家人一起進去點了兩碗牛肉麵和小菜，但交單卻被告知九月開始有低消一人一杯飲品（一定要飲品，不能換成餐點），不想喝飲料的我們，只好默默走出店家，我會覺得如果能改成每人低消多少錢會比較恰當，畢竟我們點的餐點也不便宜：）,"I went in with my family and ordered two bowls of beef noodles and side dishes, but the order was told that there were low disappearance of one cup of drinks in September (must be a drink, not for meals).

"慕名而來有點失望，牛肉麵湯頭不及格，既然有加大服務，麵跟湯的比例也請掌握好，本身牛肉湯已經夠淡，加麵後只剩煮麵水的味道，加了牛油也救不回來，同桌兩碗沒加麵的也是無味，有點傻眼。

滷味的部分勉強及格，但是論價格跟味道，新東街的幾家甚至西門町滷味都差不多，這裡價格卻不親民，可能喝酒才是本體，建議改名滷味bar。","It is a bit disappointed in coming. The beef noodle soup is failed.

已經六年多沒來過這裡了，但很高興發現它仍然在營業並且做得很好。生啤酒的選擇多種多樣，但食物卻不是😂。牛肉麵還可以。湯和牛肉都不錯，但麵條有點慘了。 DIPA 不是我的最愛，所以工作人員給我推薦了另一種，味道更苦。嗯，沒有我想像的那麼苦，但它像 IPA 一樣順滑。氣氛很好，適合更多參觀，但顯然有點貴。,"I have n’t been here for more than six years, but I am glad to find that it is still operating and doing well.There are many choices for raw beer, but food is not 😂.Beef noodles are okay.The soup and beef are good, but the noodles are a bit miserable.DIPA is not my favorite, so the staff recommended me another, and the taste is more bitter.Well, not as bitter as I imagined, but it is as smooth as an IPA.The atmosphere is very good, suitable for more visits, but obviously a bit expensive.",False

在我看來，食物不好吃。這是足夠的，還有比這家更好的牛肉小酒館。首先，他們的最低飲酒量是 1 杯，我甚至不會讓你嘗試他們的生啤酒，而大多數地方都會這麼做，特別是如果你要求人們至少購買一杯飲料的話。另外他們也不在乎你買不買食物，即使你買了食物他們還是要你每人至少買一杯飲料。現在啤酒很好，但這是唯一的事情,"In my opinion, food is not delicious.This is enough, and there is a better beef tavern than this.First of all, their minimum drinking volume is 1 cup, so I won't let you try their raw beer, and most places will do this, especially if you ask people to buy at least one cup of drink.In addition, they don't care if you buy food or not, even if you buy food, they still want you at least one drink.Now the beer is good, but this is the only thing",False

不要來這裡，因為他們不關心顧客。把錢花在其他地方。

在您來這裡之前，請務必閱讀其他 1 星和 2 星評論。主人與人爭執。我可以報告說，一切都沒有改變。","After watching the reply from the original poster, he was right, I should enter Chinese.Let me try!Everyone doesn't need to be so Lan's shop!IntersectionI have already purchased several other).If he told me a friendly way, it would be great, but I guess he didn't care about his performance.The owner spent a long time (10 minutes) after waiting for us to wait for a minute.The bill is printed from the machine immediately haha, and he is providing services to the new table before getting the bill for us.I guess he forgot.The owner is a completely unpleasant guy.

Don't come here because they don't care about customers.Spend money elsewhere.

非常熱鬧、溫馨和家庭友善的氣氛。他們還提供 8 種桶裝精釀啤酒和一個裝滿更多啤酒的冰箱。牛肉麵的湯底有點淡，肉質很嫩，但是筋有點嚼勁。希望看到他們對牛肉麵進行一些調整以適應這個地方的良好氛圍。,"Very lively, warm and friendly atmosphere.They also provide 8 kinds of barrel craft beer and a refrigerator filled with more beer.The beef noodle soup base is a bit light, the meat is tender, but the muscles are a bit chewy.I hope to see them make some adjustments to the beef noodles to adapt to the good atmosphere of this place.",False

將精釀啤酒和牛肉麵結合起來絕對是一個絕妙的主意。牛肉麵的湯料比較清淡，不是我喜歡的湯底風格，但是紅燒牛肚和牛筋都很嫩。我認為總的來說，食物和啤酒的價格對於台北市的標準來說是相當公平的，尤其是在這個社區。,"Combining craft beer and beef noodles is definitely a wonderful idea.The soup with beef noodles is relatively light. It is not my favorite soup base style, but the braised beef belly and beef tendon are very tender.In general, the price of food and beer is quite fair for the standards of Taipei City, especially in this community.",False

這個地方價格過高而且不值得。  食物不是那麼好，除了醃製菜餚。  牛肉麵裡的牛肉太有嚼勁了，份量也太小了，相對於價格來說。  啤酒主要成分是 IPA，而且太貴,"The price of this place is too high and it is not worth it.Food is not so good, except pickled dishes.The beef in the beef noodles is too chewy, and the portion is too small, compared to the price.The main ingredient of beer is ipa, and it is too expensive",False
