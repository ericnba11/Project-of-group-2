"昨天去餐廳用膳，遇到了一個不是很開心的服務體驗（其中某一人）。
以下是不好的體驗經歷：
1.上餐點的時候隨便亂說一個菜單上沒有的名字（牛肋排），當下問了第二次也一樣，導致我們都不知道是不是我們的餐點，直到我們在詢問第三次才確定（排骨）。

2.我們在點餐的時候想點shot來喝，詢問今天店裡面有什麼酒種，那位服務生直接說我們只有威跟龍舌蘭但明顯跟菜單上不太一樣，然後又補了一句龍舌蘭沒了，剩下威士忌。還沒有時間考慮馬上又補一句：啊所以要嗎 ？

事後我特別找了別的服務生跟他說了之後，也是很震驚的看著我說怎麼可能，然後又好好的幫我介紹了一次。

以上兩件事情我覺得某一個服務生對自己餐點名稱跟酒類的庫存量沒有盡到知悉的責任。

然後是在點餐或是其他交流的過程跟其他服務員有很明顯的情緒在身上，不知道他昨天是不是心情不好希望他會沒事的。

其他服務員都很棒也很熱心👍🏻","I went to the restaurant yesterday to dinner and met a service experience that was not very happy (one of them).
The following is a bad experience experience:
1. When you get a meal, just talk about the name (beef ribs) on a menu at a time. It is the same for the second time, which causes us not to know if it is our meal until we are asking the third time Only determine (ribs).

2. We want to order SHOT to drink when ordering, and ask what kind of wine in the store is today. The waiter said directly that we only have Wei and Amaranth but obviously different from the menu, and then make up for another sentence. The agave is gone, and the remaining whiskey is left.There is no time to consider to make up for another sentence: Ah, so do you want it?

Afterwards, I specially found other waiters and told him, and I was shocked to watch me say how possible, and then I introduced me again.

I think the above two things do not do the responsibility of a waiter for their own meals and wine inventory.

Then there is obvious emotions with other waiters in the process of ordering or other communication. I don't know if he was in a bad mood yesterday. I hope he will be okay.

Other waiters are great and enthusiastic 👍🏻",False

「傷心酒店」「普通朋友」喝起來普羅大眾接受度高；
「親愛的你怎麼不在身邊」還行，長相10分味道見仁見智；
「謝謝你的愛」適合喜歡酒感重的。（平常喝妹酒要考慮）

餐點部分：
水餃蝦仁餡料豐富可以點可說是招牌菜；
薯條炸得不好超油（可能我們運氣比較差）；
麻油雞飯好吃但不喜油要跳過；
豬肋排不錯要趁熱吃；
奶油杏鮑菇是兩大朵不是切片的很juicy喜歡；
總體來說配酒都不錯。

服務方面：
外場人員很親切服務態度適當，不會過度關心也不會忽視客人的需求，用餐過程都很舒適。

""It's still lonely"" is worthy of liked it;
""Sad Hotel"" and ""Ordinary Friends"" have high acceptance of the general public;
""Why are you not around?"" It ’s okay.

Meal part:
Rich dumplings and shrimp filling can be ordered to be said to be signature dishes;
French fries are not fried well (maybe we have poor luck);
See oil chicken rice is delicious but does not like oil to skip;
Pork ribs are good to eat while hot;
Cream of Aidi Posteriii is not like the two big flowers.

"天啊！！沒想太多直接訂了位走進來！

這餐點我認真給10顆星， 水餃，豆乳雞，湯圓，三杯魷魚沒有一個雷！！
我自認為我對水餃超挑，他水餃認真不開玩笑欸，超Q肉餡多還有蝦子，我的天～難得在餐酒館吃到超好吃料理，價格也很平易近人！

酒的部分：我點了最大大眾的傷心酒店（Long Island )也是不開玩笑耶～不是騙人的妹酒！有酒感～喝酒不是就是為了要微醺嗎❤️

剩下也點了三四杯沒一杯雷
覺得台北沒地方去了的，可以來這試試看

歌也跳脫以往的都是西洋歌，都是台灣的流行樂～我覺得偶爾換換口味是不錯的選擇😌

完全認真推薦！🙂👧🏻😍❤️

Wine part: I ordered the greatest Volkswagen's sad hotel.Have a sense of wine ~ Isn't it just to drink it? ❤️

The rest also ordered three or four cups without a cup of thunder
I think there is no place in Taipei, you can come here and try it

The songs have also been escaped from the past, all of which are popular music in Taiwan ~ I think it is a good choice to change the taste occasionally 😌

Recommended seriously!🙂👧🏻😍❤️

Btw Bartender accidentally sent the wrong wine (we still sit on the bar), but haven't the wine but found him wrong ~

整體的體驗非常的糟糕讓人失望，應該來說是台灣酒吧里管理最混亂的一個，希望這個店的創建人可以看到反饋，如果想了解具體的情況可以和我聯繫。第一，我們有在網路上預訂，可是當天（8月11號）的服務生在門口確認了我們的預訂，說是要整理桌子讓我們在外面等，後來卻沒有出來找我們，當我們再進去的時候服務生把位子給了後來到的客人；我們再次提起我們的預訂的時候，另一個服務生說我們的時間過時了，要我們再等10多分鐘，雖然店裡包括吧台有至少5個座位是空的，我們只有兩個人。第二，在我們入座吧台之後，別的所有的人的酒都是在5分鐘到10分鐘之內上桌，甚至包括比我們遲到的人，而調酒師和服務生讓我們等了20分鐘，並且在我們催促之後，才上了我們的酒。所以我們是毫無理由地讓我們等了半個小時。另外，酒感覺像是很不經意的做的，特別是在我要求要少糖精的情況下，調灑師還是放了正常的糖精，感覺很不尊重客人。,"The overall experience is very bad. It should be the most chaotic management in the Taiwan bar. I hope that the creator of this shop can see feedback. If you want to know the specific situation, you can contact me.First, we have a booking on the Internet, but the waiter of the day (August 11) confirmed our booking at the door, saying that we need to organize the table to let us wait for us. When I went in, the waiter gave the seats to the guests later; when we mentioned our reservation again, another waiter said that our time was outdated and we had to wait more than 10 minutes. The seat is empty, we only have two people.Secondly, after we take the seat table, the wine of all other people is on the table within 5 minutes to 10 minutes, including even the person who is late than us. The bartender and waiter asked us to wait for 20 minutes And after we urged, we got into our wine.So we waited for half an hour without any reason.In addition, wine feels like it is very inadvertent, especially when I ask for less sugar, the tune division still puts normal sugar essence, and it feels disrespectful to the guests.",False

"谷歌地圖上，店名誰人知~

在 Google Maps 上找不到的酒吧，只能從 Instagram 上面查到與訂位（想不到發文的時候已經出現了）；原本以為是神秘隱蔽的 speakeasy ，原來就是本來陸光小吃的位置...

門口還是相對低調，店內空間不大，但有個 DJ 台上面寫著失戀庇護所還是挺特別的，有 fu!! 吧台後的酒櫃是冰箱擺放，跟一般酒吧有些不同但有別有一番感覺。

酒單攤開，定睛一看竟然是不同的華語金曲，搭配上當天店內也在播放 C-pop 更是讓人沉浸在氛圍中。酒本身也有許多台灣的元素在裡面，用經典調酒再去做 twist 後，以不同的形式呈現。

個人特別喜歡「跳上車子離開傷心的台北」，想必看到這段文字，腦海中一定也出現旋律跟歌詞；但其實這是動力火車另外一首新歌的歌名，而非忠孝東路走九遍。但或許我喜歡這杯是因為用了 plastic cup，除了特別之外我還可以外帶邊走邊喝（？

奇妙的是，店裡的客群感覺非常多元，大家有機會可以來體驗下這裡的氛圍。","On the map of Google, whoever knows the name of the store ~

The bars that can't be found on Google Maps can only be found and reorganized from Instagram (it has appeared when I never think of the post); originally thought it was the mysterious and concealed Speakeasy, which turned out to be the location of Lu Guang snack ...

The door is still relatively low -key. The space in the store is not large, but there is a DJ platform that is still very special. There is a FU !! The wine cabinet behind the bar is refrigerated. It is different from the general bar but it feels different.

The wine was spread out, and it turned out to be different Chinese golden songs. It was also immersed in the atmosphere.There are also many elements in Taiwan in the wine itself. After using classic bartending and then doing TWIST, it is presented in different forms.

I personally like to ""jump into the car and leave the sad Taipei"". Presumably when you see this text, the melody and lyrics must also appear in your mind; all over.But maybe I like this cup because I used Plastic Cup. In addition to specially, I can also walk while drinking (?

When ordering, the clerk was very confident that he said that he could memorize his back empty -handed. As a result, the two dishes were missed with a glass of wine.But later lost a cup of Shot.

In fact, the decoration is actually unique except those common on the Internet.

心碎是寶石！食物很棒（喜歡他們的餃子、爆米花雞肉、滷味），飲料是一流的（飲料名稱也超級有創意，很適合商店的概念），當然還有工作人員，他們非常友好，非常樂於助人。氣氛超酷又時尚，音樂播放清單也很好聽，有時他們會邀請台灣著名的 DJ 現場演奏。雖然酒吧可能很忙，但與朋友愉快交談的聲音卻不會太大。我強烈推薦 Heartbreak 度過一個愉快的夜晚，但絕對需要提前預訂。,"Heart broken is gem!The food is great (I like their dumplings, popcorn chicken, and lochi).
