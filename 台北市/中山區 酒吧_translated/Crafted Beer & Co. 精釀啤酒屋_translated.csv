"非常適合下班後去小坐一下，精釀啤酒的酒類豐富，有一些很有趣的品項，可以試試看也可以跟店員詢問。
店內不算有供餐（只有少量點心），但花博美食一條街，倒是不成問題","It is very suitable for sitting up after get off work. The wine is rich in wine. There are some very interesting items. You can try it or ask the clerk.
There is no meal in the store (only a small amount of snacks), but there is no problem with the streets of Huabo food."
"跟朋友週五下班喝酒的老地方！
氛圍很棒、酒好喝

但是因為週末人很多，所以需要早點卡位，或是拿著酒到戶外座位區享受也不錯啦💛","Old place to drink with friends on Friday!
The atmosphere is great, the wine is good

But because there are many people on the weekend, you need to get stuck early, or you can enjoy it with wine to the outdoor seat area."
走到櫃檯前，沒有人理我們，後來發現店員是看我們一眼就繼續跟外國人聊天的人，我們討論一下後，他才轉頭過來看著我們，也不說話就一直看著（一副你要幹嘛），我們有點愣住開口問是隨便坐嗎？店員才點頭，也沒口頭回覆，感覺很差。因為沒喝過這間啤酒看起來不錯，喝完個人是蠻喜歡的，不過結帳的時候說900，我們詢問可以分開付嗎，就收650跟280，出去後才發現怎麼怪怪的🤣如果分開算會比較貴可以告知我們吧～跟外國人話很多，一句話都不想跟我們講，整體來說，看到那個男店員在，就不會想走進去囉😂喝一杯就想趕快換一間了 …,"Before walking to the counter, no one cared about us. Later, I found that the clerk was a person who continued to chat with foreigners at a glance. After we discussed, he turned to look at us, and kept watching without talking (a pair of pairs (a pair of pairs What are you going to do), do we hold the mouth and ask if you sit casually?The clerk nodded and did not reply verbally. It felt bad.Because I haven't drank this beer, it looks good, I like it after drinking, but when I checkout, I said 900. We asked if we can pay separately. If you are more expensive, you can tell us ~ There are a lot of words with foreigners. I do n’t want to tell us in a word. On the whole, when you see that male shop staff, you will not want to walk in. Between ..."
酒沒有很好喝可以怪我不懂酒，但前天晚上的男店員也太奇特了吧，第一次去感覺店外觀不錯，結果進去後發現飲酒過程一點都不友善，越坐越緊繃一點都不放鬆，好像問個問題都就覺得我打擾到他了，我真是滿頭問號？結帳付費方式也不提醒，酒類也不介紹，去便利商店看店員的親切我看還比較開心。不推～～～不好喝～～～,"The wine is not very delicious, you can blame me not to understand the wine, but the male clerk the day before yesterday was too strange. For the first time, I went to feel that the shop's appearance was good. As a result, I found that the drinking process was not friendly at all. Don't relax, as if asking a question, I feel that I bother him, am I really full of question marks?The payment method is not reminded, and the alcohol is not introduced. I look at the clerks for the convenience store to see the clerk.Don't push ~~~ Not good ~~~"
"決定要打評論同時，自己也覺得自己滿荒謬的，搞得很像奧客，但仔細想想確實不開心到想拉星，奧客在此🧏🏻‍♀️
酒跟其他整體喜歡的，會想說欸這個也想喝喝看那個也想喝喝看～
但今天講了兩遍要載具，還是給我紙本發票，哇超不爽🦦是有納悶是不是耳朵真的不是很好，又或者是音樂真的太大聲，所以她真的沒有聽到，因為在我說要載具前，另一位店員光跟她講說我要280的，也是講兩遍，所以不太理解是耳朵不好還是我們講話都太小聲，又或者是沒有在專心聽別人說話。
為了這件事心裡不舒服到來發評論，打完還是覺得自己真的蠻荒謬，可是就想發，因為就不想拿紙本啊！又不是我忘記說🔥
除了載具講兩遍還是給我紙本之外（還在怒）歡迎用新台幣支持（真心推薦）
只是連給到紙本發票都可以被寫評論（還在記仇），真的生意難做。","At the same time, I decided to make a comment. I also felt that I was ridiculous and made very much like an Austrian, but if I think about it, I really want to pull the stars.
I like wine with other overall, I want to say that I want to drink, drink, and want to drink and see ~
But I talked about the vehicle twice today, or I still invoiced my paper. Because before I said the vehicle was going to be the vehicle, another clerk told her that I wanted 280, and I also talked twice, so I don’t understand whether the ears are bad or we speak too well, or they are not concentrating on listening. Others speak.
For this matter, I was uncomfortable to make comments. I still felt really ridiculous after playing, but I wanted to post it because I didn't want to get a paper!It's not that I forgot to say
In addition to the carrier, I still give me a paper (still angry) Welcome to support it with NT $ (I really recommend it)
It is just that you can be written to the paper invoice (still revenge), and it is difficult to do it."
店裡氣氛很chill大家各自小酌聊天很開心，而且啤酒有超多可以選，不知道喝什麼店員也會熱心幫忙介紹，超推！！,"The atmosphere in the store is very happy, everyone has a good chat, and the beer is too much to choose. I do n’t know what the shop clerk will be enthusiastic to introduce, super push!Intersection"
"我是一位通過Cicerone Certified Beer Server認證的精釀啤酒愛好者，在圓山花博Maji Square的Crafted beer & Co. 是我經常來訪的精釀啤酒店家之一。
這邊精釀啤酒種類繁多，業主與服務人員不僅親切，也很專業。
他們的專業強烈的反映在選擇精釀啤酒的品味。因此，店內除了常見的國內外精釀啤酒外，也不時有國外知名酒廠的頂級作品。

在售價上，以台灣市場來說，個人認為是合理的。當然，如果要跟超市販售的啤酒相比，我想這是不同的類別。而如果購買罐裝啤酒回家，一定要數量也有折扣，這也是我定期來這邊幫我的冰箱補貨的原因之一。

"🏠位於花博的集食行樂區域，位置不多，週末下午停下腳步喝酒的人們挺多。

🍺精釀啤酒的種類屬多，有外帶的常溫啤酒，架上有明顯標價、冰櫃內的瓶裝及罐裝，以及六款的生啤。這次選了蔡式釀酒的Taimmortal SOS Cucumber Gose ，小黃瓜的酸爽風味，適合豔陽的午後。

店內氣氛輕鬆，價格屬合理，支持電子支付，能有冰杯就更好了。","食 Located in Huabo's food and music area, there are not many locations. There are quite a lot of people who stop and drink on the weekend.

There are many types of craft beer. There are room temperature beer, with obvious prices on the shelf, bottles and cans in the freezer, and six raw beer.This time, the Taimmortal Sos Cucumber Gose, which was selected by Cai -style wine, was a sour flavor of the cucumber, suitable for the sun in the afternoon.

The atmosphere in the store is relaxed and the price is reasonable. It is even better to support electronic payment. It is even better to have ice cups."

"啤酒選擇多，依稀記得是三個冰櫃及三個鐵架，店員會主動介紹；先買單並提供刷卡，無開立發票；燈光偏昏暗，冷氣非常涼爽，可惜沒有冰杯也沒有爆米花🍿️不過可以自帶外食，也算是挺不錯的，炎炎夏人有這樣的精釀啤酒店可以來一杯風味比較不一樣的啤酒，還是挺美好的👍

📅2022.07下旬","There are many beer choices, and I remember that they are three freezers and three iron frames. The clerk will take the initiative to introduce; first pay for and provide a card, no invoice; the light is dark, the air conditioner is very cool, but unfortunately there is no ice cup or explosion. You can bring your own food, which is pretty good. There are such craft beer restaurants in the hot summer people to have a cup of beer with different flavors.

By the way, I think the clerk is so beautiful hahaha (⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎)"

帥氣的老闆非常專業，台北精釀啤酒必訪名店!,"The handsome boss is very professional, Taipei craft beer must visit famous shops!"
"這邊啤酒很好，不要誤會我，但是店家外面賣的墨西哥攤很糟糕。以前賣的很好吃，但是現在簡直在騙人的樣。3個小塔可250台幣實在有夠貴。而且加上衛生環境也不是很佳分。拜託大家不要被他因為香而被騙。 還有他的burritos 簡直是個笑話，根本就是在亂做。怎麼可以說是burritos? 拜託不要再自己台灣國土上傻傻當個觀光客被這個號稱異國料理給騙了。台灣有很多其他墨西哥餐廳來做選折。

之前啤酒店家都會擺國外小吃攤，以前的墨西哥攤是很好吃，但不知道為什麼現在擺的攤那嗎爛。說實在的，我也嚴重懷疑在店面外面自己擺攤是不是合法的。我非常失望！

The business here is a well known place for craft beer, it’s been in business for a long time. I have no complaints what so ever on Crafted, in fact they host a wide variety of craft beers around the world and it is great. But I do however am very disappointed with the Mexican vendor stationed outside of Crafted. I understand that different vendors comes and goes depending on how they cooperate their events with Crafted, but this Mexican vendor seems to be an exception because it seems to be operating there indefinitely. Is this even in compliance with Maji square’s regulations?Aside from that, the main reason for my disappointment is it’s price which is 250nt for 3 Small tacos. Please reevaluate your pricing as it seems that first of all, you don’t seem like a legitimate business and secondly you’re not subjugated with insane monthly rental fees like all other vendors in Majisquare or other legitimate Mexican restaurants in Taipei city with sells tacos well under 250nt with a much better variety, volume and sanitary conditions.

Also, the burritos this Mexican vendor serves is an absolute joke. It shouldn’t even be called a burrito as it just looks like a bigger taco with sprinkles of rice on it and a copious amount of hot sauce (if you wanted spicy).

I highly suspect that this Mexican vendor is just taking advantage of our local taiwanese citizens with limited experiences on Mexican cuisine.

I am very disappointed as this Mexican vendor used to serve one of the best tacos there is, but it just a scam to me now.","The beer here is very good, don't misunderstand me, but the Mexico stalls sold outside the store are bad.I used to sell it delicious, but now it is just deceiving.3 small towers can be expensive enough.And coupled with the sanitary environment is not very good.Please don't be deceived by him because of incense.And his Burritos is simply a joke, just doing it at all.How can it be said to be Burritos? Please don't be deceived by this exotic cuisine as a tourist.There are many other Mexican restaurants in Taiwan to choose from.

Before that the bread hotel, the breed hotel will set up a foreign snack stall. The Mexico stalls were delicious, but I do n’t know why the stalls now set are rotten.To be honest, I also seriously doubt whether it is legal to set up a stall outside the store.I am very disappointed!

The six faucets are all locals. The refrigerator is filled with local beer and selected beer from Belgium and the United States.
The service of the bar is very friendly, and the guys know the beer scene very well.
There are no other foods except fries and popcorn.
The price is not cheap, but it is consistent with all other beer restaurants I have been so far.The freshness of barrel beer is impeccable.
Recommended to all beer enthusiasts."
冰箱裡有多種 IPA 啤酒，還有一些桶裝啤酒。  環境黑暗而寒冷，是一邊喝著清涼啤酒一邊觀看角色扮演者走過的好地方。,"There are many IPA beer in the refrigerator and some barrel beer.The environment is dark and cold, and it is a good place to watch the role player while drinking cool beer."
於 2022 年 12 月 24 日參觀，位於台北世博會的繁忙地點和位置。本地生啤酒和大量來自歐洲和美國的進口精釀啤酒。可以說是台北最好的選擇。,"Visit on December 24, 2022, located at the busy place and location of the Taipei Expo.Local raw beer and a large number of imported craft beer from Europe and the United States.It can be said to be the best choice in Taipei."
可能是我最喜歡喝啤酒的地方之一。他們有很多不錯的啤酒和水龍頭可供選擇。週五和其他日子他們有一些很酷的活動。我還可以從外面帶食物來搭配啤酒。這對我來說就是天堂。工作人員非常友好。,It may be one of my favorite places to drink beer.They have a lot of good beer and faucet to choose from.They have some cool activities on Friday and other days.I can also bring food from the outside to match beer.This is heaven for me.The staff is very friendly.
喝速溶啤酒的好地方。店主勞爾 (Raul) 非常了解他的啤酒。還有有趣的小遊戲。然後我們騎腳踏車繞河邊的公園轉了一圈。,Drink a good place to drink fast beer.The owner Raul knows his beer very much.There are also interesting mini games.Then we rode a bicycle around the park by the river.
"去喝點精釀啤酒的好地方。有射手和瓶子，有台灣的，也有國外的。
勞爾非常友好，他給了我一些建議，我度過了愉快的時光。
最讓我驚訝的是，他會說西班牙語！ 👍🏼👍🏼 如果他們說英語已經很困難了。
如果您在該地區（或不在該地區），請停下來享受這個地方。然後離開的時候在馬吉廣場走一圈，很美 …","Go to drink a good place for craft beer.There are shooters and bottles, some in Taiwan, as well as foreign ones.
Raul was very friendly. He gave me some suggestions, and I spent a pleasant time.
What surprised me the most was that he would speak Spanish!很 If they are difficult to speak English.
If you are in the area (or not in the area), stop and enjoy this place.Then walk a circle in Maggie Plaza when I leave, very beautiful ..."
良好的氛圍和美味的啤酒。台北非常獨特的地方,Good atmosphere and delicious beer.Taipei is very unique place
4 種標籤啤酒，但有很多瓶裝啤酒可供選擇。很好的簡單設定。晚餐前吃一兩個最合適,"4 kinds of tag beer, but there are many bottled beer to choose from.Very simple setting.Eating one or two before dinner is the most suitable"
非常適合喜歡異國文化的朋友。氣氛、音樂、燈光都很適合情侶、朋友、同事在這裡喝酒,"It is very suitable for friends who like exotic culture.The atmosphere, music, and lights are very suitable for couples, friends, and colleagues to drink here"
喝了一杯，我試了1號和2號，都不錯,"After drinking a drink, I tried No. 1 and 2, all good"
選擇相當多，除了有台灣的之外，也有國外相當多種類的精釀啤酒，以玻璃瓶的方式裝，現場也有杯裝的精釀啤酒四款，都可以試喝後再購買。從週一到週五每天有不同的優惠方案，可以挑選喜歡的方案去享受一杯啤酒。店內也有賣一些配啤酒的小菜，但如果不喜歡，亦可到外面美食街購買。,"There are quite a lot of choices. In addition to Taiwan, there are quite a few types of craft beer abroad. In the form of glass bottle, there are four cup of craft beer on the spot. You can try it before buying.There are different preferential programs every day from Monday to Friday. You can choose your favorite solution to enjoy a cup of beer.There are also some beer dishes in the store, but if you don't like it, you can also buy it from the food street outside."
他們有相當多的啤酒可供選擇。我很享受。這是我第一次嘗試紅點啤酒。真的很好。,They have quite a lot of beer to choose from.I enjoy it.This is the first time I have tried red beer.It's really good.
"地方不大，提供多種瓶裝精釀啤酒和五種桶裝啤酒。通常總是有桶裝啤酒。他們還有葡萄酒和蘋果酒。店裡有空調，可以容納幾個人，但是你可以拿出啤酒在商店前喝。廁所距離酒店有一段距離，但也許在喝啤酒的間隙散步對您有好處？
本周有一些促銷活動，並且他們有保真卡系統。如果談話很快就讓您感到無聊，可以藉用一些紙牌遊戲。","The place is not large, providing a variety of bottled craft beer and five types of barrel beer.There are usually barrel beer.They also have wine and apple wine.There are air conditioners in the store to accommodate a few people, but you can take out beer to drink in front of the store.The toilet is a distance from the hotel, but maybe a walk for beer is good for you?
There are some promotional activities this week, and they have a real card system.If the conversation quickly makes you boring, you can borrow some card games."
"我四月在台灣獨自旅行時去了這裡，啤酒的選擇很棒，工作人員非常友好。我碰巧遇到了店主和他的朋友，最初很友好一個多小時左右，他變得有點敵意，我感到不受歡迎。不太確定發生了什麼事，但我找了藉口離開了。

我絕對會推薦這個地方，但如果你遇到他，可能不會和店主交談太久。","I went here alone in Taiwan in April. The beer choice was great, and the staff was very friendly.I happened to meet the shopkeeper and his friends. At first, it was very friendly for more than an hour. He became a little hostile, and I felt uncomfortable.I'm not sure what happened, but I found an excuse to leave.

I will definitely recommend this place, but if you meet him, you may not talk to the owner for too long."
"可以喝IPA啤酒(^_-)
缺點是店裡的工作人員不會說中文。","You can drink ipa beer (^_-)
The disadvantage is that the staff in the store will not speak Chinese."
啤酒不錯，價格合理，地點方便，離地鐵站很近。他們提供 4 種本地桶裝啤酒、大量本地和外國精釀啤酒、一些蘋果酒和葡萄酒。氣氛很好，想如果世界更忙的話。,"Beer is good, the price is reasonable, the location is convenient, and it is very close to the subway station.They offer 4 kinds of local barrel beer, a large number of local and foreign craft beer, some apple wine and wine.The atmosphere is very good, I think if the world is busy."
地方雖小，但有很多啤酒可供選擇。這是一座啤酒殿:)),"Although the place is small, there are many beer to choose from.This is a beer hall :))"
這是我在台北最喜歡的酒吧之一。它位於maji廣場的中間，因此該地區有很多食物可供選擇。工作人員也非常專業且知識淵博。如果你幸運的話，你可以遇到店主，他是一個非常好的人。總的來說，這是一個非常好的、寒冷和放鬆的地方。,"This is one of my favorite bars in Taipei.It is located in the middle of Maji Square, so there are many foods to choose from in the area.The staff is also very professional and knowledgeable.If you are lucky, you can meet the owner, he is a very good person.In general, this is a very good, cold and relaxed place."
很棒的地方，有來自世界各地的大量啤酒可供選擇。我特別喜歡台灣啤酒廠的部分。這個地方很安靜，有美麗的背景音樂（獨立搖滾，不太吵），店主非常酷，隨時準備為您提供建議並推薦最好的啤酒。位置也很有趣，因為它周圍都是其他俱樂部和自助餐廳，入口前的公共區域幾乎每天晚上都有現場音樂表演。超推薦！,"A great place, there are a lot of beer from all over the world to choose from.I especially like the part of the Taiwan Brewery.This place is very quiet, with beautiful background music (independent rock, not too noisy), the owner is very cool, ready to provide you with suggestions and recommend the best beer at any time.The location is also very interesting, because it is surrounded by other clubs and buffet restaurants, and the public areas in front of the entrance have live music performances almost every night.Recommended!"
我最喜歡喝美味飲料的地方。這裡氣氛悠閒，員工友善，還有物超所值的精選啤酒。您可以買熱的帶回家，也可以冷藏以立即潤滑口腔關節。他們還提供精選的台灣微釀啤酒，您應該品嚐一下……您知道……既然您來到了這裡。,"I like to drink delicious drinks.The atmosphere here is leisurely, the employees are friendly, and there are good selection beer.You can buy the hot one home, or you can refrigerate to lubricate the oral joint immediately.They also provide selected Taiwan micro -brew beer, you should taste ... you know ...

"一個可愛的小酒吧，氣氛很好，位置優越。他們有多種當地啤酒以及美國和比利時啤酒可供選擇，其中包括很難買到的 Leffe 啤酒。

業主很友善並且樂於提供協助。不確定他們是否提供小吃，但外面有很多餐廳。

如果想喝高品質的啤酒，我強烈推薦這個地方。","A cute little bar, the atmosphere is very good and the location is superior.They have a variety of local beer and US and Belgian beer to choose from, including LEFFE beer that is difficult to buy.

馬吉廣場是喝精釀啤酒的好地方。他們提供多種瓶裝精釀啤酒、比利時啤酒以及蘋果酒。還提供四個水龍頭，供應不同的精釀啤酒。有一張長桌，可容納 8-10 人，旁邊還有一些其他座位。友善的會說英語的工作人員。,"Maggie Square is a good place to drink craft beer.They offer a variety of bottled craft beer, Belgian beer and apple wine.There are also four faucets to provide different craft beer.There is a long table that can accommodate 8-10 people, and there are some other seats next to them.Friendly speaking of English staff."
馬吉廣場是一片夢幻般的塑膠綠洲。有多種瓶裝和罐裝啤酒可供選擇，總是有 4 種桶裝啤酒，商店很舒適，工作人員很友好，提供良好的建議和服務以及桶裝啤酒的樣品。很高興讓您自備食物來吃飯，或讓您坐在外面喝啤酒。如果你喜歡精釀啤酒，就來這裡吧！僅供參考，忽略谷歌地圖上的開放時間，它們比谷歌建議的更加隨機。,"Maggie Square is a dreamy plastic oasis.There are many types of bottles and canned beer to choose from.

It provides good suggestions and services and barrel beer samples.I am very happy to let your own food come to eat, or let you sit outside and drink beer.If you like craft beer, come here!For reference only, ignoring the opening time on Google Maps, they are more random than Google's suggestions."
