"很失望，之前在 IG 上看到別人的女僕酒吧影片我才慕名而來，想說看評論感覺都不錯我還找了三個朋友來，結果我們全程待了 2 小時沒有半個女僕來我們包廂，還蠻失望的

我第一次來所以我是沒有指名女僕，我以為是店家會隨機派一個女僕來跟我們這桌互動，如果有聊得開心，賞酒跟拍立得我們其實都很樂意的但就是.... 沒有半個女僕來 =0=

然事後才得知好像人力不足但... 我看現場有三個女僕吧... 另外兩個也沒有要過來的意思 QQ
所以覺得挺失望的，我只想給一顆星

不過我得說調酒師加奈子她調出來的酒還挺好喝的，我個人很喜歡（是個酒鬼XD），人也直來直往很喜歡，為了這個多一顆星

但... 不知道第一次來反正就被放置惹，看其它兩個包廂都有女僕（而且看起來是一位應付兩個包廂），就覺得這落差感也太大了吧~

希望店家未來可以改善，畢竟我們第一次來不太懂，就是希望能體驗到女僕的文化，不然去信義圓山喝酒好了...","I was very disappointed. I used to see someone else's maid bar movie on IG. , Quite disappointed

I came for the first time, so I did n’t have a name maid. I thought that the store would randomly send a maid to interact with our table. If you have a good chat, we are actually happy to enjoy the wine and the shooting .. .. No maid came = 0 =

After the incident, I learned that it seems that there is insufficient manpower, but ... I think there are three maids at the scene ... the other two have no meaning to come to QQ, QQ
So I feel disappointed, I just want to give a star

However, I have to say that the wine tunnel Kanako's wine is quite delicious. I personally like it (it is an alcoholic XD), and people also like it. For this more star

But ... I do n’t know if I ’m the first time I was placed and provoked. Seeing that the other two boxes have maids (and they seem to be a handling two boxes), I feel that the difference is too great ~

I hope that the store can improve in the future. After all, for the first time, we do n’t understand it. I hope to experience the culture of the maid, otherwise I will go to the Yiyuan Mountain to drink ..."
"9/13 晚上大約11點來到貴店，第一次來消費坐在吧台，接待我的是一個穿黑色衣服（當天活動是軍裝）的可愛女生，從幫我介紹酒水開始都很親切～我給她個人五顆星評價～（抱歉我忘了妳的名字）

接著我右邊的右邊有位客人貌似喝醉，一直大小聲抱怨他自己的事情，大聲到我的耳膜會痛那種，也罷，喝酒的場合。難免遇到沒水準的酒客，這也不關店家的事，旁邊有位他的朋友（當天休假的女僕員工），可能看到我略顯不悅的神情，立即過來和我抱歉，說他朋友喝醉非常抱歉，這點很棒，但我覺得吧台上班人員應該主動婉轉規勸這位客人，而不是任由這位客人大小聲～

然後我坐了兩小時後續沒有任何女僕過來找我聊天（可能當天客人也比較多？），覺得無聊，只喝了一杯調酒沒過低消，打算離開，結果發現我放在桌上的藍芽耳機盒子不見了！我找了一陣子，很確定它原本就放在我面前吧台的桌上，由於我專注的帶藍芽耳機看手機，去一趟廁所回來後就發現它消失了，要求吧台人員查看監視器畫面，原來是我去廁所期間，服務人員以為這位子沒人了把它收到櫃檯裡…總之拿走的服務人員沒有注意狀況，我回來找了超久也沒注意～

找到藍芽耳機盒子後，我說要買單，接著，到結帳這段期間，我足足等了超過10分鐘以上，我看結帳人員一直專注在結帳的平板上操作，也許在Key上一個帳的單子，Key非常非常久，然後，她終於Key完了！結果，竟然跑去和一位客人聊天！我傻眼🙄，略顯不悅和她說我要結帳！她才意會過來～

總結：除了一開始接待親切的女僕，中間沒有任何上班女僕主動過來聊天，然後又發生一堆鳥事，吧台人員又不夠機靈不會處理狀況，略顯被動，請貴店多多加油囉～","At about 11 o'clock in the evening on 9/13, I came to Guidian for the first time. The first time I came to consume in the bar, I received me with a lovely girl wearing black clothes (the activity of the day was military uniforms). I was very kind from the beginning of helping me. Give her a personal five -star evaluation ~ (Sorry I forgot your name)

Then one of the guests on the right side of my right seemed to be drunk and complained about his own affairs. It would be painful to my eardrums, but the occasion of drinking.It is inevitable to encounter no standard wine guests. This is not about the store. There is a friend next to him (a maid employee of the day of the day). He may see my slightly displeased expression. He immediately came over and sorry for me. My friend was very sorry for being drunk. This is great, but I think the work staff of the bar should take the initiative to polite the guest, instead of letting the guest sound ~

Then I sat for two hours and no maid came to chat with me (Maybe there were more guests on the day?), I felt boring, I only drank a glass of bartender and did not disappear too low. I planned to leave. The bud headset box is gone!I found it for a while, and I was sure it was originally placed on the table in front of me. Because I looked at the mobile phone with the Bluetooth headset, I found it disappeared after I went back to the toilet. It turned out that during my time when I went to the toilet, the service staff thought that no one took it to receive it in the counter ... In short, the service staff who took away did not pay attention to the situation.

After finding the Bluetooth headset box, I said that I would pay for it. Then, during the period of the checkout, I waited for more than 10 minutes. A list of accounts, Key for a long time, and then she finally finished!As a result, I ran to chat with a guest!I was dumbfounded, and I was slightly displeased to tell her that I wanted to checkout!She would come over ~

Summary: In addition to receiving a cordial maid at the beginning, there was no work maid to come to chat, and then a bunch of birds happened."
"環境好，調酒好喝女僕可愛
*煙灰缸是以前的照片，目前店內禁菸，不喜歡煙味的朋友可以放心前往~","Good environment, besiege and delicious maid cute
*The ashtray is a previous photo. At present, there are no smoking in the store. Friends who don’t like the smell of smoke can rest assured ~"
"樓下最新的客人真的超誇張
我人就坐在旁邊座位
拍照是你們親口說A要幫B出錢買拍 還問能不能公主抱= =你們不要以為客人都是耳背跟瞎子欸 賞酒是不知道啦 但那時候你們卡在櫃台我聽到那個女僕一直道歉說你們突然不願意拍了或說不賞了都可以退掉 你們自己不退 還敢留這種留言 笑死 新人女僕在那邊陪你們你們也什麼回饋都不給別人⋯ 我跑這邊那麼多次很少看到你們這種這麼坑的欸 哈哈哈","The latest guests downstairs are really exaggerated
I am sitting next to the seat
Take a picture, you said that A should help B to buy the money and ask if you can hold the princess = = You don't think that the guests are the back of the ears and the blind. I apologize and say that you are suddenly reluctant to shoot or you can retreat. You can retreat. You will not retreat. You dare to leave such a message. The newcomer maid will accompany you with you. I rarely see you like this kind of pit. Hahahaha"
"Albert Aug喝醉在那邊亂！還刷退！白漂還敢亂留負評！
這裡的調酒師的調酒明明就很好喝也很棒，女僕也很尊重客人，奧客喝醉真的是別鬧了！
真正來體驗才會知道這裡的好👍","Albert Aug is drunk there to mess there!Still retreating!Bai Diao dares to leave a negative review!
The bartender here is obviously delicious and great. The maid also respects the guests. Don't make trouble to get drunk!
I really know that I will know the good here."
"第一次來這種店，店內光線明亮，每桌都有女僕陪聊～氣氛輕鬆愉快☺️
酒的部分，點了白日夢，主要是加了藍柑橘、伏特加，微酸微酸的帶點檸檬清香，口味上比較清爽

整體心得
店內輕鬆自在跟女僕之間可以互動、聊天的時間長得多
就算一個人來也可以很愉快，調酒都有一定的水準
價格上我覺得不算貴，環境、氛圍都不錯，態度上當然挺好
跟朋友小酌、唱唱歌都很棒👍🏻","For the first time to come to this kind of store, the light in the store is bright, and there are maids to accompany each table ~ The atmosphere is relaxed and happy ☺️
The wine part, ordered the day dream, mainly added blue citrus and vodka, slightly sour and slightly sour with lemon fragrance, the taste is more refreshing

Overall experience
The shop can interact with the maid easily and chat with a lot of time.
Even a person can be very happy, there is a certain level
I don't think it's expensive in price, the environment and atmosphere are good, and of course it is good in attitude.
It's great to have a drink with friends and singing."
"我不介意賞酒後中途一直離開，但別人講話的時候好好聽對方講話是基本吧？
怎麼會一直專注在回手機訊息？
講話的時候對方總是回「嗯嗯嗯」來敷衍你、眼睛也都沒在看你，我相信這是個人都沒辦法接受。","I don't mind leaving halfway after appreciation, but it is basic to listen to each other's speech when others speak?
How can I always focus on returning mobile phone information?
When speaking, the other party always returns ""uh uh um"" to perfunctory you and the eyes are not looking at you. I believe this is that this is unable to accept it."
調酒師都很厲害，可以唱歌，還有飛鏢機，服務人員態度佳，五星級享受，夜生活好去處，喜歡動漫相關的人一定要去體驗看看，可以預約名璃，非常有趣的女僕，很會聊火影忍者跟海賊王，日語能力很厲害👏👏👏聊的很愉快，她的特調都跟動漫有關聯性，非常有創意又好喝，很推薦，預約一定要找名璃，其他女僕都會一直要賞酒，只有這位女僕不會一直要喝酒，還會一直跟你聊天，體感非常良好。小缺點是沒有賞酒其他女僕都不太會靠桌聊天，優點是店長跟調酒師都很帥，還有可愛的名璃妹妹❤️追蹤她的IG還會回追聊天，可愛的小妹妹😍,"The bartender is very powerful, you can sing, and dart machine, the service staff has a good attitude, the five -star enjoyment, the nightlife is good, people who like animation must experience it, you can make an appointment for Mingli. I can talk about Naruto and One Piece. The Japanese ability is very good. I have a good chat. Her special adjustments are related to animation, very creative and delicious. The maid will always enjoy wine. Only this maid will not have to drink, and will chat with you all the time.The small disadvantage is that no other maid to appreciate the other maids can not rely on the table to chat. The advantage is that the manager and the bartender are very handsome, and the lovely younger sister ❤️ Tracking her IG will also chase the chat. The cute little sister Bleak"
"長年跑局跑攤，半年前來過一次這間酒吧，當時感覺只是普通的酒吧，並沒有感受到與其他條通酒吧不一樣的感受。昨日在朋友的邀約下又踏入本店一次，一進門就看到數名可愛溫柔的服務員們齊聲喊了歡迎光臨，光是這點就讓我刷新記憶，初來乍到時並沒有這樣的服務，我才發現這是一間“女僕酒吧”
當中有位女僕服務員讓我印象深刻，雖然我有來消費過，她仍舊不厭其煩的再次介紹了一次菜單給我，從酒的口感到喜好程度都能介紹的很流暢，中間數次離桌去忙碌也會先告知，非常貼心，雖然不太能喝酒的，但用心程度比在場其他女僕都讓我更印象深刻，每個小細節都會注意，時刻注意點的餐點有沒有上、桌子有水痕馬上拿起紙巾擦拭、稍有髒亂就馬上收拾乾淨，給人體感特別好，這位特別的女僕叫做名璃，如果是第一次來，想要有好的體驗，可以向店家預約這位女僕，長得可愛；不嫌麻煩；注重細節，會仔細照顧客人，讓我對本店改觀重新留下非常好的印象，有機會還會再來光顧，名璃女僕非常的敬業，我準備離開時還特別開門90度鞠躬，一直到我坐上計程車才抬起頭來向我揮手道別，非常道地的日本式體驗。","The running stalls for many years, I came to this bar half a year ago. At that time, I felt just a normal bar, and I didn't feel different from other bars.Yesterday, I stepped into this shop under the invitation of a friend. As soon as I entered the door, I saw several cute and gentle waiters shouted and welcomed it. I just let me refresh my memory. I did n’t have such a service when I first arrived. I found out that this is a ""maid bar""
One of the maid waiters impressed me. Although I had come to consume, she still introduced the menu to me again. From the liquor, I could introduce it very smoothly. I will also tell first, very intimate, although I am not able to drink, but the degree of intention is more impressive than the other maids present. Every small detail will pay attention. At all times Immediately pick up the paper towels and wipe it, and immediately clean it up immediately, which gives the human body very well. This special maid is called Ming Li. If it is the first time, if you want a good experience, you can make an appointment with the store. The maid, cute; not troublesome; pay attention to details, will take care of the guests carefully, let me have a very good impression on the store's change, and I will come to patronize again when I have the opportunity. Special opened the door 90 degrees and bowed until I got on the taxi before I looked up to wave my hand and said goodbye to me, a very authentic Japanese -style experience."
"以前並不是個常跑店的人，
但自從來了這裡後，
就幾乎變成這裡的常客，

這裡的定位
比較像酒吧在微加女僕元素，
所以跟日常的女僕店有點不太一樣，
有時上班勞累完後直接下班過來，
不僅可以放鬆喝一杯，
這裡的女僕也會傾聽你說話，
聽完也很會主動開話題，
並不會放置客人，
每次來體驗都很棒。

店裡也有打鏢機，
喜歡打鏢的可以過來玩；

調酒師17、鳳坡、店長Blue的
調酒也都很好喝，
幾乎都有喝過，
沒有失望過，
也有無酒精飲料，
如果騎車、開車的人也不用擔心
條通這裡也很好叫車，
不用擔心無法回家。

我最推薦的女僕是名璃，
歡迎大家可以跟她預約，
很會畫拍，
也很好聊天，話題涉略很廣，
很多都可以聊，
但她最喜歡聊的一定是動漫，
是個死忠的火影忍者、海賊王，
她的特調也幾乎都跟動漫有關，
因此如果你是二次元迷，
跟她預約一定不會失望。","I was not a person who runs a often -running shop before,
But since it came here,
It almost become a frequent visitor here,

The positioning here
It's more like a bar in the micro -maid in the micro -maid,
So it is a bit different from the daily maid store,
Sometimes after work after work, I will come to get off work directly after work,
Not only can you relax and drink a cup,
The maid here will listen to you,
After listening to it, I will take the initiative to open the topic,
Do not place guests,
Every time I experience it is great.

There are also darts in the store,
Those who like darts can come and play;

Bartender 17, Fengpo, store manager Blue Blue
The bartending is also very delicious,
Almost all have been drinking,
Never disappointed,
There are also wine fine drinks,
Don't worry if you are riding and driving
It is also very easy to call a car here,
Don't worry about being unable to go home.

My most recommended maid is Mingli,
Welcome everyone to make an appointment with her,
I know how to draw,
It is also very good to chat, the topic is very wide,
Many can talk,
But she likes to talk best with anime,
He is a loyal Naruto and One Piece,
Her special adjustment is almost related to animation,
So if you are a two -dimensional fan,
I will not be disappointed with her."
"裝潢好看 服務人員親切
對我這個第一次跑店的新手很熱情的介紹
然後在這邊推一位叫名璃的妹抖

另外店內有免費的日k機 對自己歌聲有興趣的人可以來挑戰","Good -looking service staff is kind
I am very enthusiastic about my first -time novices who run the shop
Then push a sister named Mingli here

In addition, there are free Japanese K machines in the store who are interested in their singing."
"如果你說這是一間女僕酒吧
我會說這是一間酒吧

也許周遭的店家清一色酒吧
所以我覺得比較像酒吧➕一點女僕元素

食物：
出餐真的非常慢…
點泡麵會等上一小時，炸物超過45分鐘
(推薦真的要吃飽再來)
兩次造訪經驗差不多都等很久

酒：
調酒系列的都很好喝(太好喝了都忘記拍)
店家會不定期更新一些特調飲品🍸
水準不錯(以酒吧價格來看CP值還不錯
喜歡調飲類的人可以嘗試看看

服務：
假日時段造訪人比較多就會覺得亂
(我兩訪都是假日時段)
女僕人數不太多(?)不賞酒容易放置(maybe?
可能其他桌都有賞酒給女僕
所以會有找不到人加點
或是自己去找服務人員點餐的可能😂
不過有喜歡的女僕賞酒
她們就可以坐在你那一桌聊天一下子
有能力的話可以按鈴🛎️全體賞酒
(請全工作人員喝酒 人數x300)
全店員工會到你那桌敬酒🥂很壯觀

總結：
不可以肚子餓進去這間店
店內比較接近酒吧經營模式
喜歡女僕元素的可能要有點心理準備
低消是500/小時續坐300/小時
好處是拍立得賞酒也可以算低消
調酒🍸很好喝👍推薦✨","If you say this is a maid bar
I would say this is a bar

May
So I think it's more like a bar 女 a little maid element

food:
It's really slow to go out ...
Pointing noodles will wait an hour, and the explosives exceed 45 minutes
(Recommended that you really have to eat full and come again)
Two visits have been waiting for almost a long time

liquor:
The bartending series are all delicious (I forget to shoot too much when it is too delicious)
The store will update some special drinks regularly 🍸
Good level (at the price of the bar, the CP value is not bad
Those who like to adjust drinks can try to see

Serve:
There are more visits during holidays and will feel messy
(My two visits are holiday periods)
There are not many maids (?) It is easy to place without watching wine (Maybe?
Maybe other tables have wine appreciation for maids
So there will be no one to find someone to add some points
Or may you find the service staff for ordering 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
But there are favorite maids to appreciate wine
They can sit at your table and chat all at once
If you have the ability, you can ring the bell 体️ All the wine appreciation
(Please drink the number of people to drink X300)
All the staff will get toast at your table 🥂 It's spectacular

Summarize:
Can't be hungry in this shop
The store is closer to the bar business model
Those who like maid elements may have a little psychological preparation
Low consumption is 500/h to sit for 300/hour
The advantage is that the appreciation of the wine can also be regarded as a low consumption
Blooming 👍 Very delicious ✨ Recommended ✨"
"位於條通內唯一的特色女僕酒吧 不定期舉辦生誕祭 地下偶像歌手及cosplay活動
氣氛熱鬧 店家老闆也很細心照顧每位客人 也可外帶食物以及外賣
店內女僕多樣化 也會輪番與每位客人互動 是可體驗女僕文化的好去處","Located in the only characteristic maid bar in Tongtong, the underground idol singer and Cosplay event in the birthday sacrifice of students and cosplay
The atmosphere is also very careful to take care of each guest.
The diverse maid in the store will also turn in turn with each guest to experience a good place to experience the maid culture"
"結論：可以唱K打鏢喝酒很不錯，客人座位之間的距離也很剛好，但是因為被灌單下次不會再回訪。

我們四個人去點了一支好喝的宇治茶梅酒3000，是明日香女僕長推薦的，人很nice會聊天會唱歌也不會催我們點

但是現場有一個女僕，已經忘記名字了，只記得她喜歡跟人家聊動漫話題並且稱兄道弟。（後來知道叫做名璃）
如果你遇到這個人的話要小心，以下是原因：

1. 我們四個人去點了一支酒明明已經滿足低消條件，卻跟我們說時間已經到了如果不繼續點就要離開。

2. 即使之後解釋知道是誤會也馬上推說是明日香叫她來催我們的她什麼都不知道，這種賣隊友的態度令人不齒。

3.在跟同桌友人聊火影聊得很開心的時候過來跟我們說「可以跟你們一起喝酒嗎？」得到同意之後就在我們的酒單上面加了一杯賞酒300元的消費，我們事後才發現。

3.1 就算是我們沒有意識到這句話是賞酒的Trigger，她得到這杯酒之後也沒有盡賞酒的職責，跟我們說去跟對面打個招呼就一直去陪對面的客人聊天了，果然是不負責任的人。

4. 口臭。","Conclusion: It is very good to sing K to drink darts and drink, and the distance between the guests' seats is also very good, but it will not return to visit because of the next time it is filled.

The four of us went to order a delicious Uji tea plum wine 3,000. It was recommended by the maid of Asuka. People are very nice to chat and sing.

But there was a maid at the scene, and she had forgotten the name. I just remember that she liked to talk to others about anime topics and called brothers and brothers.(Later, I knew it was called Mingli)
If you meet this person, be careful, the following is the reason:

1. The four of us went to order a wine that had met the low conditions, but told us that the time had arrived, and we had to leave if you didn't continue to order.

2. Even after the explanation was misunderstanding, it was immediately that it was that Asuka asked her to urge us, she didn't know anything. The attitude of selling teammates was unyielding.

3. When I was chatting with a friend at the same table, I came here to tell us, ""Can you drink with you?"" After getting the consent, we added a cup of consumption of 300 yuan on our wine list. Only discovered.

3.1 Even if we don't realize that this sentence is the Trigger of the wine appreciation, she did not do my best to enjoy the wine after getting this glass of wine. She told us to say hello to the opposite side and chat with the guests from the opposite side. Sure enough It is irresponsible person.

4. Stomach breath."
"今天去看一日女僕的雪薇，裡面的妮可滿會唱歌跟玩遊戲互動的，後來互動完發現她滿會做料理的，女僕早早超漂亮，互動優質
下次有機會再過來回訪","Today, I went to see Xue Wei, a maid of the maid today. Nicole is full of singing and interacting with the game. Later, after interaction, she found that she would cook. The maid was super beautiful early, interactive high -quality
Next time I have a chance to come and go back to visit again"
無酒精特調也很好喝 軟飲也可以喝得很開心 趕在名璃的萬聖節特殊活動服來店內！（17特調很好喝）,There is no alcoholic special tone and delicious soft drink. You can also drink very happy to rush to the store in the special Halloween special event in Mingli!(17 special tunes are delicious)
"宇治茶梅酒🥃推推推👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
謝謝幫忙做菜單沒有的莫斯科驢子還用銅杯 👍🏻✨️","Uji tea plum wine push push push
Thank you for helping Moscow, which is not a menu, Moscow also uses a copper cup 👍🏻✨️"
"有飛鏢機的女僕酒吧～
酒好喝 店長的特調很特別很好喝
店長帥女僕親切～","A maid bar with a dart machine ~
The special adjustment of the wine manager is very delicious
The manager's handsome maid is kind ~"
"很喜歡一個叫葳葳的客人？女僕？
總之就是一個偽娘
我們沒預約，所以除了進來的一段時間都是沒有人陪的，可能是預約制？
之後看他跟另一個女僕說了什麼之後他就常常待在我們這桌了，陪我們打鏢玩骰子。
還說賞酒算在別的女僕身上就好，所以才猜他是客人。
總之整體的回憶是開心的，酒很好喝，葳葳跟其他女僕也很好，追蹤了幾個女僕，下次會記得預約。","I really like a guest named 人?Maid?
In short, it is a pseudo -mother
We did not make an appointment, so there was no one to accompany except for a period of time. Maybe it was the appointment system?
Later, after seeing what he told another maid, he often stayed at our table and accompanied us to play darts and dice.
He also said that the wine appreciation is just fine on other maids, so he guess he is a guest.
In short, the overall memories are happy, the wine is delicious, and the other maids are also very good. I track a few maids. I will remember to make an appointment next time."
"這家店調酒是厲害的這點無庸置疑
還是有點遺憾
擅長的調酒希望可以更多元一點
不要只有單單琴酒類的強
整體來說我認為調酒很值得喝
水準很高
就算是不擅長的調酒喝起來的風味還是很好的

這家的女僕不會帶氣氛
玩遊戲真的也很爛
打鏢也是很菜的那種
聊天也是尬聊的那種
女僕的態度遠遠不如調酒師來的好
我總感覺那邊的女僕給人的感覺是

“我不缺錢
只想四處
走走晃晃
不要跟我聊天”

氣氛是不錯的
真心的說要給大酒給調酒師比較值得","This shop is amazing to bartender.
Still a regret
I hope that I am good at bartending hope can be more diverse
Don't just have a strong piano wine strong
Overall, I think bartending is worth drinking
The standard is very high
Even the flavor of drinking that is not good at sobying is still very good

This maid will not have the atmosphere
Playing games is really bad
Dart darts are also very dish
Chat is also the kind of embarrassing chat
The attitude of the maid is far less than the bartender.
I always feel that the maid over there gives people the feeling that it is

""I don't lack money
Just want to
Walk around
Don't chat with me ""

The atmosphere is good
Really, it is more worthwhile to give bartender to the bartender"
每次來這邊都是看朋友喝到咪咪貓貓🤣🤣🤣,"Every time I come here, I watched my friends drink Mimi Cat 🤣🤣🤣"
"這邊酒是一顆星
酒爛沒關係，但服務要好吧
不好意思，連公關桌面服務的沒有
我們來到林森北，來到女僕酒吧
期待是女僕公關桌面服務（主動聊天點餐、倒酒、點酒、倒水、酒杯空了馬上清潔整理桌面、某桌人多主動準備小椅子，在林森北這是基本）
貴店什麼都沒有，兩次體驗感受非常差
可能我自己花錢請女生朋友喝酒陪我聊天還比請女僕喝酒還盡興
Ps其實女僕人都非常好，這部分比較針對對店家沒有Sop對於女僕桌面服務訓練跟要求，好像覺得有妹穿女僕裝在店裡走動客人就高潮了
然後一年了，大概唯一有改變賞酒制度沒有綁死種類，其他很明顯是沒有要求
連店長都在閒晃，點個酒要等到天荒地老，然後相同的酒都爛
請問客人是來花錢受罪嗎","The wine here is a star
It doesn't matter if the wine is rotten, but the service is good
Sorry, do you even have public relations desktop services?
We came to Linsen North and came to the maid bar
Looking forward to the maid's public relations desktop service (active chat, pour, wine, order wine, pour water, wine glass empty immediately, clean the desktop, a table person to take the initiative to prepare small chairs, this is basic in Linsen North)
There is nothing in your shop. The experience of the two experiences is very poor
Maybe I spend money by myself and ask a friend to drink with me to chat with me than asking the maid to drink.
PS is actually very good maid. This part is more for the store for the store without SOP for the maid desktop service training and requirements. It seems that I feel that a girl wears a maid in the store.
Then for a year, probably the only way to change the wine appreciation system has not been tied to death, and the others are obviously no requirements
Even the store manager was shaking, ordered a wine to wait until he was old, and then the same wine was rotten.
Does the guest come to spend money and suffer?"
"17的調酒非常好喝！待人親切！
女僕Ayaha&鞠子非常可愛又會聊天❤️
下次會再來！","17 bartending is very delicious!Treat people kind!
Maid Ayaha & Juzi is very cute and chats ❤️
Will come again next time!"
廁所非常乾淨衛生！第一次來到女僕酒吧，甚至很少看到酒吧的廁所這麼乾淨的，打掃衛生的工作人員非常棒👍整間店雖然昏暗了一點但非常乾淨舒適，當日靠桌聊天的女僕很多，名璃跟調酒師17非常親切友善，建議想體驗女僕酒吧的可以找名璃預約，坐吧台可以同時跟調酒師和女僕聊天👍👍👍17的調酒非常精湛，原以為女僕酒吧的調酒不會太好喝並沒有抱著會喝到好喝的調酒期待，結果出乎意料！！！名璃很喜歡聊天，不會有被無視的感覺，坐吧台感覺CP值最高，還會再訪👍補充：名璃實在很可愛。,"The toilet is very clean and hygienic!For the first time I came to the maid bar, I rarely saw the toilet in the bar so clean. The cleaned staff were very good. Although the whole store was a bit dim Following the winemaker 17 is very kind and friendly. It is recommended that you want to experience the maid bar. You can make an appointment for Mingli. Sitting on the bar can chat with the bartender and maid at the same time. It will be too delicious and I don't expect to drink and drink for drinking. The result is unexpected!IntersectionIntersectionMing Li likes chatting, and there will be no feeling of being ignored. I feel that the CP value is the highest in the bar, and she will visit it again: Ming Li is really cute."
酒吧非常的有趣，女僕還會陪你聊天，而且當天還有表演能看太棒了,"The bar is very interesting, the maid will also chat with you, and the performance can be seen too great that day"
"小弟不才
剛好跑過目前全台北的女僕店及
三件女僕酒吧

時間到要自己找女僕加點的
我承認自己也有疏失沒注意到時間

請問以後貴店是不是桌上要放個碼錶計時
59分的時候提醒主人要加點或是滾蛋呢？","Younger brother
Just ran through the current maid shop in Taipei and
Three maid bars

Time is to find a maid to add some point
I admit that I have lost time and I didn't notice time
But want to ask
May I ask if your store will have a code gauge time on the table?
Remind the owner to add some or get out of the time when he is 59 points?"

"有趣的酒吧

整體裝潢營造都蠻粉紅少女的
如果是女生來的話應該會很喜歡
消費部分還算合理 一個人喝平均約一千出頭

缺點部分就是酒稍微上的有點慢

店長老闆都蠻熱情的 店員也都非常有誠意","Interesting bar

The overall decoration is pretty pink girl
If it is a girl, I should like it very much
The consumption part is quite reasonable.

The disadvantage is that the wine is slightly slower

The owner of the store manager is quite enthusiastic, the clerk is also very sincere"
鞠子好可愛 ( ૢ⁼̴̤̆ ꇴ ⁼̴̤̆ ૢ)~ෆ,Juzi is so cute (ꇴ 可 ⁼̴̤̆ ૢ) ~ ෆ
"橘子好可愛～

Come to chat with me!I want to find her next time ❤️❤️"
連無酒精的飲料都調的認真又很好喝，Mariri 和 Naraku 都很nice跟貼心👍 女生來玩也會很放鬆跟開心的🌹,Even alcohol -free drinks are very serious and delicious. Mariri and Naraku are very nice and intimate girls to play.
"女僕基本上沒有來互動
酒的部分還不錯 份量比較少稍嫌可惜
卡拉OK設備比較沒那麼好 如果想來唱歌的要有心理準備","The maid basically did not interact
The part of the wine is not bad.
The Kara OK device is not so good. If you want to sing, you need to prepare psychological preparation"
"鞠子好可愛 很好聊天
特調也很好喝👍👍","Juzi is so cute and good to chat
The special tone is also very delicious 好"
已經是老常客啦😂超推名璃～～ …,"Already an old frequent guest, Lauho Super Push Mingli ~~… ..."
"2023/8/19 晚間九點進入消費，點完酒之後女僕就不見了，隨後店長前來說明今日女僕人手不足(訂位時完全沒提及此事)，後續女僕再也沒有來過我們這邊， 之後點酒也是bartender來點。最好笑的是一直來找我們聊天的甚至不是店內的女僕而是當天來店表演的偶像，那我想請問貴店所謂的""女僕""酒吧的定義是?坐了兩小時 女僕只有一開始來幫我們點酒，大概互動不到五分鐘，那我真的去一般酒吧就好了欸。整體體驗非常非常糟糕 建議大家去之前請三思或是問清楚當天""女僕""人手是否充足。絕對是全台最差女僕酒吧沒有之一","2023/8/19 will enter the consumption at 9 o'clock in the evening, and the maid will disappear after ordering the wine. Then the manager came to explain that today's maid's hand is insufficient (the matter was not mentioned at all at all), and the follow -up maid never came to us again. Here, after ordering wine is also Bartender.The most funny thing is that I have been looking for us to chat, not even the maid in the store, but the idol who came to the store that day. Then I want to ask the so -called ""maid"" bar of Guidian? Let's order for less than five minutes, then I really go to the general bar.The overall experience is very, very bad, it is recommended that you think twice before going to see if the ""maid"" man has sufficient ""maid"" that day.Definitely the worst maid bar in Taiwan"
"因為捧場朋友才去，結果雷的要死。

先是點餐就在一旁呆坐著
朋友先到 我後到一直被女僕說：為什麼遲到！ 竟然遲到！
然後不能單獨一人結帳也不說清楚，一開始跟女僕說要結帳，還一直聽成別的
甚至問我：很急嗎？
然後結果算完要給她錢跟我說：我們都是整桌一起結，不能單獨，那這樣前面一開始可以說，我自己看菜單可以算。真的是謝謝妳喔😀","Because of the friends, Lei was going to die.

Sitting on the side of order first
Friends come to me and have been said by the maid all the time: Why are you late!It's late!
Then you can't check the checkout alone and don't make it clear. At first
I even asked me: Is it anxious?
Then the result was to give her money to tell me: We are all settled together and we cannot be alone. Then I can say at the beginning that I can calculate the menu by myself.Thank you so much"
第一次來，店長Blue很親切的招待，rio妹妹的日文超好，我的日本朋友喝的超開心，很棒的店以後還要再來！,"For the first time, the store manager Blue was very kindly entertained, Rio's sister's Japanese was super good, my Japanese friends were very happy to drink, and the great shop will come again in the future!"
坐了一個小時才有女僕過來聊天，酒也很普通。  比較像是有穿女僕裝的酒吧,"After sitting for an hour, a maid came to chat, and the wine was very ordinary.It's more like a bar wearing a maid dress"
"17的酒非常好喝！！
值得推薦的一間店👍","17 wines are very delicious!Intersection
A store worth recommending 的"
"鞠子很可愛聊天聊得很開心!
下次還會再來聊天!!","Ju Zi is very cute and chats very happy!
I will chat again next time !!"
"服務：⭐️
餐點：⭐️
裝潢：⭐️
氣氛：⭐️
整體感受：差，不會再訪。

可以唱日文歌和玩飛鏢，以女僕餐廳而言消費算高而且計價方式比較特別（低消500元，每多一小時低消+300元）
東西不好吃又貴，份量還很少，先不論女僕顏值，光是態度死板不太會開話題感受就不太好了，之前去別家都會迎接，會主動聊天且會稱呼為主人，這間都沒有這些服務，感覺服務態度只是普通店員稱不上女僕。
再來個人覺得店內氣氛不太好，燈光昏暗又沒什麼特別的裝潢，店內太吵雜動線混亂，拍立得就在路中間，正在拍照的時候都會擋住進出，另外有點歌跟射飛鏢，但是同樣會很干擾感受，店內講話音量都要加大。
總歸就定位而言有點四不像，要說酒吧太吵雜而且東西太難吃。要說女僕餐廳服務不到位氣氛也過於沈悶，不論哪一種定位都有更好的選擇。","Service: ️ ️
Meals: ⭐️
Decoration: ⭐️
Atmosphere: ⭐️
Overall experience: Poor, no visit.

You can sing Japanese songs and play darts. In terms of maid restaurants, the consumption is high and the price method is relatively special (500 yuan low, low consumes low+300 yuan per hour)
The things are not delicious and expensive, and the portion is still very small. Regardless of the maid's face value, the attitude is not very good at the topic. There are no these services, and the service attitude is just that ordinary clerks cannot be called maids.
Come again, I think the atmosphere in the store is not very good, the lights are dim and there are no special decorations. The shop is too noisy and confused. It is in the middle of the road. When you are taking pictures, you will block in and out. It will also feel very interfered, and the volume of speeches in the store will increase.
It is a bit different in terms of positioning. It is too noisy to say that the bar is too noisy and unpalatable.To say that the atmosphere of the maid restaurant is too dull, no matter which positioning has a better choice."
"璃茉.鞠子好可愛好棒！

從店長到女僕都太好玩了，是間讓人很放鬆的店！,"It's so fun from the manager to the maid, it is a very relaxed shop!"
"走入今年下半年才開幕的平價酒吧，每個小時低消500元(點酒水+餐點滿500元即可第二小時加點300元即可，也可以攜帶外食到店內吃)，以女僕文化店的平均消費來說，這家調酒、酒食的價位蠻親民的。

體驗到賓至如歸的女僕服務，在充滿放鬆氛圍的空間裡喝個現調夢幻系酒飲，吃個現做暖心酒食，享受周五夜晚的微醺時刻。","Entering the cheap bar that opened only in the second half of this year, 500 yuan low at a low of 500 yuan per hour (ordering drinks+meals for 500 yuan to add 300 yuan in the second hour, or you can bring food to the store to eat), use maid culture For the average consumption of the store, the price of this bartender, wine and food is quite close to the people.

After experiencing the maid service of Binzhi Rugui, drink a dream -making wine and drink in the space full of relaxed atmosphere, eat a warm -hearted wine, and enjoy the slight time on Friday night."
"蠻溫馨的一間女僕酒吧~

"這個地方寬敞乾淨。這是一個輕鬆的參觀氛圍。我們在工作日參觀，當天沒有特別活動。顧客大多是台灣人，有些還會唱日文歌曲。女傭也能聽懂一些英語。我們與幾個女傭互動，橘子招待我們過夜。

沒有購買更多飲料的衝動體驗。價格都清楚地列在菜單中。即使您獨自光臨，也可以在吧台找到座位。

女服務生在桌子之間輪流與所有顧客互動。女服務生很友善，與個人顧客和團體顧客相處融洽。","This place is spacious and clean.This is a relaxed atmosphere.We visited on our working days and there were no special activities on the day.Most of the customers are Taiwanese, and some also sing Japanese songs.The maid can also understand some English.We interact with a few maids, and oranges entertain us overnight.

No impulse to buy more drinks.The price is clearly listed in the menu.Even if you come alone, you can find a seat on the bar.

Female waiters turn in turn with all customers between the tables.Women's waiters are very friendly and get along well with individual customers and group customers."
"氣氛很好，我以為台灣人會喜歡，但是幾乎沒有外國人，包括日本人，會說英語的更不用說日語了，所以節目沒有附設演員，也沒有客服。需要支付高價的酒吧。

即使你點了無限暢飲，你點了一杯飲料，但它始終沒有出來，所以你再向另一個人點一杯，它仍然沒有出來，超過 15 分鐘後，你幫別人訂的，終於出來了。

只有兩個做清酒的調酒師還不錯，其他的服務都低得可怕。","The atmosphere is very good. I think Taiwanese people will like it, but there are almost no foreigners, including Japanese, and those who speak English, let alone Japanese, so the show has no actors or customer service.You need to pay a high price bar.

Even if you ordered an infinite drink, you ordered a drink, but it never came out, so you ordered another one to another person. It still has not come out. After more than 15 minutes, you help others and finally come out.

There are only two bartenders who make sake, and the other services are terrible."
女孩們在說日語時很努力，所以我想支持她們！,"The girls worked very hard when they were talking about Japanese, so I wanted to support them!"
瑪麗莉和奈落可愛又漂亮。我很享受在這裡的時光,Marie and Nai Luo are cute and beautiful.I enjoy the time here
