不過去完衣服會殘留煙味
不介意的捧油可以去喝酒唱歌🎤
不會日文裡面也有中文歌可以唱","The boss is very hilarious and cute
But after going to the clothes, the smoke will be left

"這裡算是條通喝酒最便宜的店之一了
老闆是個很容易喝醉但很有趣的日本人
蠻有個性的常常開店遲到🤣

但如果你喜歡唱歌喝酒

那這裡是條通最屌的店之一","This is one of the cheapest shops in Wulin to drink alcohol

"日本大叔開的日式卡拉OK bar.
一個人服務費100, 可盡情的唱歌 日本的點歌系統幾乎什麼歌都點的到。
老闆調的Gin tonic 好喝！
非常適合三五好友來唱歌聊天。
可以室內吸煙，但也造成一個缺點就是空氣不好，衣服會變很臭。","Japanese -style karaoke bar opened by Uncle Japan.
A person's service fee is 100, and you can sing the Japanese song system that you can almost order.
The boss's GIN TONIC is delicious!
Very suitable for three or five friends to sing and chat.
It can smoke indoors, but also a disadvantage is that the air is not good, and the clothes will become stinky."
"很好玩！邊喝酒邊唱歌。老闆是日本人，不太會講中文，但裡面的服務員可以幫你翻譯。練習日文的好機會喔！老闆人很好玩，酒又便宜又好喝。但不能太晚去啦，會沒有位置。

禮拜天前去，第一次走進日本人開的酒吧，走進去一瞧，原來日本人下班為什麼會去酒吧，那種親合力與生活壓力下的產物，完美詮釋了，能在這找到溫度，很喜愛這間酒吧，希望有更多人知道💕,"Go before the day, walk into the bar opened by the Japanese for the first time, and walk into a look. Why did the Japanese go to the bar after work? The product of the kind of personal and living pressure is perfectly interpreted. I can find the temperature here to find the temperature here. I love this bar very much, I hope more people know 💕"
老闆是日本人，店裡面有KTV可以點歌，是越晚越熱鬧的一家店，要預約,The boss is a Japanese. There is a KTV in the store to click the song. It is a shop that is later and more lively.
服務很差 很明顯有座位 老闆看到了兩個外國人就一直喊「定位、定位」。我問他什麼意思他只回我「定位、定位」好吧 氣氛看起來很不錯 就是顏色不對,"The poor service is obviously that the owner of the seat has always shouted ""positioning, positioning"" when he saw two foreigners.I asked him what he meant."

"一家酒吧，老闆非常友善有趣🤔
營業到早上，酒很便宜，有卡拉OK，有飛鏢，有玩具，真是個好玩的地方。當您想要享受樂趣而不僅僅是放鬆時，建議您來這裡。
店主非常聰明開朗，但他也是一個非常好的人，善於解讀氣氛並為顧客服務。
我強烈推薦它。 …","A bar, the boss is very friendly and interesting 🤔
In the morning, the wine is very cheap, there are karaoke, darts, toys, it is a fun place.When you want to enjoy fun instead of relaxation, it is recommended that you come here.
The owner is very smart and cheerful, but he is also a very good person who is good at interpreting the atmosphere and serving customers.
I highly recommend it.Mowing"
"唯一的缺點是煙霧繚繞的環境，否則這是一個有趣的唱歌場所
…","The only disadvantage is a smoky environment, otherwise this is an interesting place for singing
Mowing"
清酒很美味，工作人員和師傅都精神抖擻。,"The sake is delicious, and the staff and the master are shaking."
"我來過這裡很多次了，在我看來，這是中山最好的卡拉 OK 酒吧。調酒師 Jun 個性很好，很熱情。 KTV系統擁有大量英文、中文、日文歌曲（JOYSOUND）。飲料很便宜——不是頂級的，但比該地區大多數酒吧便宜。確保提前給他們發訊息和打電話——他們很忙，你不能總是和一群人一起走進去。通常他們只有 2-3 名員工，所以如果擁擠的話可能會很忙 - 要有耐心並確保與他們溝通。

編輯：要強調前面的訊息部分。將他們加入 Instagram 上或獲取老闆的 LINE。有時工作時間不一致，因此在計劃走進之前請先諮詢他。","I have been here many times. In my opinion, this is the best karaoke bar in Zhongshan.The bartender Jun has a good personality and enthusiastic.The KTV system has a large number of English, Chinese, and Japanese songs.Drinks are cheap -not top -level, but cheaper than most bars in the area.Make sure they send them messages and call in advance -they are busy, you can't always walk in with a group of people.They usually have only 2-3 employees, so if they are crowded, they may be very busy -to be patient and ensure communication with them.

Edit: It is necessary to emphasize the previous message part.Add them to Instagram or get the LINE of the boss.Sometimes work hours are not consistent, so please consult him before planning."
我最喜歡的地方。非常舒適的氛圍，良好的卡拉 OK 機，友好熱情的員工和客人，以及超級棒的老闆 Miata 先生。價格合理。我會把它推薦給任何人。已經去那裡快一年了，仍然喜歡它。,"My favorite place.A very comfortable atmosphere, good karaoke machine, friendly enthusiastic employees and guests, and superb boss Mr. Miata.The price is reasonable.I will recommend it to anyone.It's been almost a year, and I still like it."
在該地區類似性質的選擇中，這是迄今為止最底層的抽屜。服務很慢，飲料又貴又差，而且工作人員特別不友善。這是一個需要避免的地方。 *編輯*：幾乎每個方向都有更好的地方可以去。,"In the area of ​​similar nature in the area, this is the bottom drawer so far.The service is very slow, the drink is expensive and poor, and the staff is particularly unfriendly.This is a place to avoid.*Edit*: There are better places in almost every direction."
溝通不良。   谷歌表示全週開放。  我星期三到的。  晚上 9:30。沒開。沒人在家。,Poor communication.Google said it was open throughout the week.I arrived on Wednesday.9:30 pm.Did not open.No one is at home.
這是我最喜歡的酒吧，老闆和工作人員都非常友善和樂於助人！,This is my favorite bar. Boss and staff are very friendly and helpful!
溫暖的地方，有美味的飲料！,"In warm places, there are delicious drinks!"
老闆和工作人員真的很好！ ！ ！ ！,The boss and staff are really good!IntersectionIntersectionIntersection
適合一小群朋友。日本卡拉 OK 吧,"Suitable for a small group of friends.Kara OK, Japan"
"好久沒來了，不過還是不錯的(^_-)
一個可以放鬆、喝酒的地方！","It's been a long time, but it's still good (^_-)
A place where you can relax and drink!"
雖然是飛鏢酒吧，但它是一家無限暢飲的餐廳，你幾乎看不到有人玩飛鏢。,"Although it is a dart bar, it is a restaurant with unlimited drinking. You can hardly see someone playing darts."
非常友好的顧客和工作人員！,Very friendly customers and staff!
"老頭很有趣
精彩的","The old man is very interesting
Splendid"
店主是個好人。,The owner is a good person.
