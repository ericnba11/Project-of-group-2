2024-11-23 16:07:10,587 - INFO - 翻譯成功：政大附近近一個月內新開的餐酒館。到訪的這天中午吃得不多，所以晚餐時間超餓，用餐人入6位，剛好可以把菜單上推薦的項目都大概點一下，也順便寫下當天的用餐體驗。

\U0001f538服務
服務生一開始遞上菜單，首先菜單的這個材質很容易反光，配上這個底色和字的顏色，看得有點辛苦。點餐要自己寫在便條紙上，便條紙也是深色，搭上藍色原子筆，眼睛會有脫窗感。
服務生感覺是會和客人玩鬧的那種，像是我們覺得很熱請他開一下座位上方的冷氣，他就說要我們自己想辦法(內心充滿問號)。後來冷氣直吹太冷，他拿雨傘給我們橋擺葉，也是很有趣。不知道這台冷氣的遙控器到底是發生什麼事為什麼不能用^_^?
上餐的部分非常的慢，因為很餓所以把這裡當小吃店在點，點了大約7道左右，全程大概每10-15分鐘才會上一道，吃完一份馬上就覺得很空虛，所以建議還是先吃點東西墊墊肚子再來這裡小酌會是比較好的選擇。

\U0001f539餐點
熱炒的部分點了三杯雞和雞鬧豆腐，很好吃，很適合配飯（可惜沒白飯，炒飯又很慢才上）。炒飯就是一般的炒飯堆成金字塔的樣子，就當作是因為疊這樣很耗工所以出餐才很慢好了∼炸物和串燒都算正常發揮，因為真的等得很餓所以吃什麼都覺得好吃。
啤酒買3送1（同價位），點餐時就要先決定要哪種價位的，然後再自己去冰箱拿。特調的話，白色佳人感覺就是檸檬汁，配上檸檬皮的苦澀感；西瓜特條像是稀釋過的西瓜汁；芒果特調比較有酒的感覺（非專業，勿鞭）。

\u25aa\ufe0f環境
用餐座位有吧台區、四人桌、八人桌。這次是坐在靠近廁所的八人桌，雖然是八人桌但桌上餐具只有六份@@桌上如果可以提供多一點衛生紙就好了，不然什麼都要再跟服務生要有點麻煩∼廁所則是蠻乾淨的，洗手台上還有提供牙線和漱口水，很貼心∼ -> Newly opened restaurants in the nearly one month near Zhengda University.I did n’t eat much at noon on the day of the visit, so the dinner time was super hungry, and the dining people entered 6 people. It was just that the items recommended on the menu were probably clicked, and by the way, I wrote down the dining experience of the day.

\U0001f538 \U0001f538 \U0001f538 \U0001f538 \U0001f538 \U0001f538 \U0001f538
At the beginning, the waiter handed the menu. First of all, the material of the menu was easy to reflect. With the color of this background color and character, it was a bit hard.If you order, you should write it on your own paper. The strip paper is also dark. When put on the blue atomic pen, the eyes will have a windowing feeling.
The waiter feels the kind of playing with the guests, as if we feel that he is very hot to ask him to open the air -conditioned above the seat, he said that we want to find a way (full of question marks).Later, the air -conditioned was too cold, and he took the umbrella to the bridge leaves, which was also very interesting.I do n’t know what happened to this air -conditioning remote control. Why ca n’t it be used^_^?
The part of the meal is very slow, because I am hungry, so I treat it as a snack bar, or order about 7, and the whole journey will only be available every 10-15 minutes. It is recommended that you eat something first and then come here to drink it. It is a better choice.

Meal
The hot fried part ordered three cups of chicken and chicken to make tofu. It was delicious and suitable for meals (unfortunately there was no rice, and fried rice was very slow).Fried rice is the same as the pile of fried rice into pyramids. It is used as a very slow delivery because it is very worked because it is very worked. They all feel delicious.
Buy 3 get 1 (the same price) for beer. When ordering, you must first decide which price you want, and then go to the refrigerator by yourself.If you are special, the white beauty feels like lemon juice, with the bitterness of lemon peel; watermelon specialty is like diluted watermelon juice; mango special feel is more wine (non -professional, do not whip).

\u25aa\ufe0f Environment
The dining seats are bar areas, four -person tables, and eight -person tables.This time is the eight -person table sitting near the toilet. Although it is a eight -person table, there are only six tableware on the table @@ \u8fd9 If you can provide a little more toilet paper, otherwise you have to be a bit troublesome to the waiter ~ The toilet is quite clean. There are also dental floss and mouthwash on the washstand, which is very intimate ~

All the unpleasant dining feelings on the day were immediately informed of the waiter and asked the waiter.

They have finished 2 dishes and 2 cups of drinks.
