過年在華山文創看到，店面設計很美，店家很親切願意提供試喝，本來只想買梅酒，試喝其他口味後，每一款都想帶大瓶的回家，很適合微醺小酌！支持小農文創,"I saw in Huashan Cultural and Creative in the New Year. The store design is beautiful. The store is very kind to provide trial drinks. I just wanted to buy plum wine. After trying other flavors, each one wanted to bring a big bottle home. IntersectionSupport small agricultural culture",False
"21號當天逛至攤位上看到賣酒 因為桃.梅酒剛好是家人們都喜歡的 所以就多看了一下 也禮貌詢問能不能試喝 當下售貨小姐說梅酒可以但桃酒因為萃取一滴有多珍貴 所以不提供試喝 我們聽完也表示了解並尊重店家規定 也沒試喝梅酒 因爲就想著要買 只是覺得提酒逛街不方便 所以就先離開打算回家前再來購買
大概3個小時之後我們特別走回櫃位打算購買兩瓶桃酒及一瓶梅酒回家 當下因為有別的客人正在跟店員說話 所以我就在一旁等 打算等他處理完眼前的客人再購買 結果就看到店員主動提供桃酒給眼前的客人跟前一批（對 前一批 因為我們等了一下）
我大傻眼！不是很珍貴不能試喝？我忍不住問不是說不能試喝？ 店員愣了幾秒 說‘’因為他們是韓國觀光客‘’ 我說所以韓國觀光客可以試喝 台灣人不可以？然後她就堆滿笑臉的跟我道歉 然後我就走了
嗯 我也想支持台灣店家 當然也是因為很喜歡喝桃味的酒 但這種眼睛在頭頂上的態度 我實在花不下去
（忍不住自我懷疑我穿的很寒酸？沒有啊畢竟是去松菸 我也是穿的人模人樣 ）
（所以是老鼠屎？還是台灣人的問題？）","On the day of the 21st, I went to the booth to see that selling wine because the peach plum wine happened to be liked by the family, so I looked at it and asked if I could try to drink. It is precious, so we do n’t provide a trial drink. After listening, we also expressed their understanding and respect for the store's regulations. I did n’t try to drink plum wine because I wanted to buy it. I felt that it was inconvenient to buy wine.
After about 3 hours, we walked back to the cabinet and planned to buy two bottles of peach wine and a bottle of plum wine to go home. Because there are other guests talking to the clerk, I wait for the guests to wait for him to buy the results. I saw that the clerk actively provided the peach wine to the guests in front of him (for the previous batch because we waited for a while)
I'm dumbfounded!Isn't it precious and not trying to drink?I can't help but ask if I can't try it?The clerk stunned for a few seconds and said ‘’ because they are Korean tourists ’‘ ’I said, so can Korean tourists try to drink Taiwanese?Then she apologized to me with a smiley face and then I left
Well, I also want to support Taiwanese stores. Of course, I also like to drink peach -flavored wine, but my attitude of eyes on the top of the head can’t spend it.
(Can't help but doubt that I wear it very shabby? No, after all, I am also like to go to pine smoke.)
(So ​​is it a mouse shit? Or is it a Taiwanese question?)",False

◉推薦：梅酒喝。
◉簡評：支持一下台灣的釀造酒。😁

藝fun券還剩點錢，來到華山把它用掉。買文青小物不適合我，還是來到【討酒吧】買點酒吧。這次經過店員介紹，才知道他們家是釀造酒，真是失禮，金次來跟日本梅酒來做點比較吧。😁

☑梅酒喝💰480 = 入口，嗯~ 跟我前幾天學長送我的日本本格梅酒比起來，久體比較沒有那麼厚實，比較淡薄，梅子的酸度明顯點，風味變化度還算可以，9%的酒精就乎無感，算是平常不飲酒的人都能輕鬆飲用；難怪店員會一直推薦做成調酒或是加蘇打水，這款還是比較適合入門者。","2022.02.27 = ★★★★ ☆
。 Recommended: Drink plum wine.
的 Brief review: Support Taiwan's brewing wine.Bleak
====================
There is still some money left by the Yi FUN coupon, and come to Huashan to use it.It is not suitable for me to buy a small thing, but I still come to [Bar] Buy some bar.This time, after the clerk, I knew that their family was brewing. It was really rude. Kim Ji came to compare it with Japanese plum wine.Bleak

💰 💰 ☑ 0 0 480 = the entrance, um ~ compared with my senior I sent me a few days ago, the long body is not so thick and thinner. The alcohol is indifferent, and people who do n’t drink alcohol can drink easily; no wonder the clerk will always recommend making bartender or add soda water. This is more suitable for getting started.",False
