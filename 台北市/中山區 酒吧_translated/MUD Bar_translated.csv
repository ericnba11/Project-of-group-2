單價稍高的工業風酒吧，每杯售價約400-450，點了3杯，喝起來都非常hardcore!酒感沒在低的！香料味也比我預期的濃郁許多，看到有人說炸魚很好吃點了一盤，吃起來卻非常乾又普通，廁所算乾淨，洗手台很酷，算是比較個性鮮明的酒吧，詢問幾次都點不到什麼酸甜口感又酒感重的酒，喜歡妹酒的人可能會不太愛這家，但威士忌類的調酒做得蠻厚重的，喜歡威士忌調酒的可以來👌,"The industrial wind bar with a higher unit price, the price of each cup is about 400-450, ordered 3 cups, and it is very hardcore! The wine is not low!The flavor is much stronger than I expected. I saw that some people said that the fried fish was delicious, but it was very dry and ordinary. The toilet was clean, and the handwashing table was cool. I ca n’t order any sour and sweet wine. People who like girls may not love this one, but whiskey ’s bartending is quite thick."
"睽違三年再訪直接升級成音響店？！

疫情期間第一次來訪這間藏在中山意舍 AMBA 樓下的酒吧，想不到後來轉成防疫旅館後便停業了許久，直到去年才開始重新營業。入口得從飯店一旁巷子，推開一扇如同倉庫般的破舊鐵門後走下 B1，瞬間海闊天空。

原先寬敞幽靜的氛圍依舊，除吧台外幾乎都是很愜意的沙發矮座，彼此間的距離夠遠也不會讓人有壓力；但牆邊竟堆起整套專業音響加上陳列的各式黑膠，似乎定期還會有 DJ 駐場放音樂，整間店感覺又更有質感了。

【Espresso Romano Martini】
以酸甜的 classic twist 開場，彷彿是酒精版西西里咖啡。改以檸檬琴酒為基底，酒感不是特別明顯，到尾端才微微浮現、非常清爽；輕抿一口冰塊上的 mascarpone cheese 再喝酒，能把風味帶得更加突出。

【Bastard Grey】
鮮明但不會過度搶戲的伯爵茶香，即便請調酒師微調過甜度，但加入了波特酒仍維持了飽滿的酒體。上層的 foam 因為是加入蛋白一起搖盪，讓整杯 creamy  口感三級跳，喜歡茶酒的千萬不能錯過。

【Meta】
苦、甜、辣。三個聽起來與調酒有些衝突的風味，卻完美的呈現在這杯裡。紅椒風味的草本酒是靈魂所在，加上澄清過的紅心芭樂多了點水果清甜，無論當開胃第一杯或重口的第三杯都再適合也不過。

另外一杯【Pacific Rim】的甜口、果香、紫蘇都女生會較喜歡的元素，但記憶點較低，只有一入口的辛香料刺激感會讓人「嗯？」一聲，稍微可惜。相比很多東區酒吧的喧囂，我其實滿喜歡中山區一些酒吧的氣氛，無論是偏日式或像 MUD 一樣，都屬於比較靜謐、適合放鬆的環境，人多人少來都很舒服。","Three years of violation of the visit to the audio shop directly into a audio shop?Intersection

During the epidemic, the first visit to the bar hidden in AMBA hidden in AMBA in Yishe, Zhongshan. I did not expect that it was later stopped to the epidemic prevention hotel for a long time, and it was not re -opened until last year.The entrance must be from the alley aside the restaurant, and push away a warehouse -like shabby iron door and walk down B1, and the sea is wide.

The original spacious and quiet atmosphere was still. Except for the bar is almost very comfortable sofa, the distance between each other is enough and it will not make people feel stressful; Global, it seems that there will be DJ station music on a regular basis, and the whole store feels more textured.

【Espresso Romano Martini】
The sweet and sour Classic Twist opened, as if it was alcohol version of Sicily coffee.Based on lemon piano wine, the wine feels not particularly obvious, and the end of the end is slightly refreshing; the Mascarpone Cheese on the ice cubes can drink the flavor more.

【Bastard Grey】
The couple of the courses who are clear but not over -grabbing, even if the bartender is asked to fine -tune the sweetness, but the bartender still maintains a full wine body.The upper layer of Foam shakes with the protein together, so that the whole cup of Creamy has a three -level jump, and those who like tea wine must not be missed.

【META】
Bitter, sweet, spicy.The three flavors that sound a little conflicted with bartender are presented perfectly in this cup.The red pepper -flavored herbal wine is the soul. In addition, the clarified red -hearted guava is more sweet and sweet, no matter whether it is the first cup of appetizers or the third cup of heavy mouth, it is more suitable.

Another cup of sweetness, fruity, and perilla when the sweet mouth, fruit aroma, and perilla are more like the elements of the [PACIFIC RIM], but the memory point is low. There is only one entrance spice stimulation that makes people ""uh?"" It is a pity.Compared with the hustle and bustle of many bars in the Eastern District, I actually like the atmosphere of some bars in Zhongshan District. Whether it is Japanese or like MUD, it belongs to a relatively quiet and suitable environment."
"氛圍不錯
剛好冷氣壞掉太熱了，不然是很想再多待一下","Good atmosphere
It's just that the air -conditioned is too hot, otherwise I really want to wait more"
"氣氛佳 調酒好喝 有層次感 小點也好吃
店員招待很周到👍👍","The atmosphere is good and delicious.
Workers' hospitality is very thoughtful 待"
"想不到MUD有撐過疫情，當日剛好在附近遊走，因此事隔四五年後再訪。店內格局似乎有些微變動，不過氣氛仍然很好，兩人坐的沙發位置也十分令人放鬆。

因為喜歡威士忌基底以及茶香，點了烏龍old fashioned，沒令人失望。杯緣柴燒的龍眼香氣撲鼻，酒體入口除了威士忌香之外，還多了輕薄的烏龍甘味。

食物的部分不知道算不算令人意外，點了店員推薦的雞翅碗，但上桌的是一整碗雞腿XD而且還有花椰菜，平衡一下罪惡感。醬汁是偏酸的口味，餐點本身是吃了會飽的份量。

本次回訪整體來說還算滿意，價位及餐點質量平衡，沒有失望，還會再來！","Unexpectedly, MUD had an epidemic, and it just walked nearby, so the matter was visited after four or five years.The pattern in the store seems to be slightly changed, but the atmosphere is still very good, and the location of the sofa sitting between the two is also very relaxed.

Because I like the whiskey base and the tea fragrance, I ordered the oolong Old Fashioned, which is not disappointing.The long -eyed aroma of the cup of firewood is fragrant. In addition to the whiskey fragrance, the entrance to the wine has a thin and light oolong sweet flavor.

The food part is not surprising. I ordered the chicken wings bowl recommended by the clerk, but the table was served with a whole bowl of chicken leg XD and cauliflower, which balanced the sin.The sauce is a sour taste, and the meal itself is a full amount of eating.

This return visit is quite satisfactory. The price and meals are balanced. If there is no disappointment, I will come again!"
"調酒沒特色，喝起來普通還這麼貴！
薯條超難吃，有夠軟
玉米片才給一點點，很坑
大雷店～真的不會再訪","There is no special feature of bartending, it is generally so expensive to drink!
French fries are super hard to eat, soft enough
The corn piece is only a little bit, very pit
Da Leidian ~ I really won't visit again"
調酒師很帥，餐點非常棒，我最喜歡吃起司盤，氣氛非常好，沙發很軟很享受可以一直拍照，喜歡拍照的人都可以來❤️🐑,"The bartender is very handsome, the meal is great, I like to eat cheese plates the most, the atmosphere is very good, the sofa is very soft and enjoyable, you can take pictures all the time. Those who like to take pictures can come."
"路過好多次今天第一次進來消費
酒很好喝，店員很有耐心的介紹
最推的是這裡的炸鱈魚條！！目前台北吃過最好吃","Passing by many times, I came in today for the first time to spend today
The wine is delicious, the clerk is very patient introduction
The most pushed is the fried cod stick here!IntersectionCurrently, Taipei has eaten the best food"
"每一杯調酒水準都很高，各種豐富的味道都融合的很好，酒精強度夠酒感卻不高！

可能是跨年酒單的關係，價格蠻高的，選擇也不多，這點稍微可惜。食物是樓上Buttermilk的，非常高水準！","Each cup of bartender is very high, and all kinds of rich flavors are well integrated. The alcohol strength is not high enough!

It may be the relationship between the New Year's Eve wine, the price is quite high, and there are not many choices. This is a pity.Food is Buttermilk upstairs, very high level!"
晚上九點過後就只有提供今日限定的四種調酒🍸🍹，我們今天嘗試了三種（神息、灰色派對、光馬丁尼），點了一份雞米花（360元），不過覺得實話有點小份，但是酒吧的環境說實話還不錯，並不會讓衣服有一些Bar的菸酒味，整體來說是一間還算有質感的Bar。調酒本身也滿不錯的。,"After nine o'clock in the evening, only the four types of bartending are provided today. We tried three types of sake (divide, gray party, Guang Martini) today, and ordered a chicken rice (360 yuan) Small, but the environment of the bar is not bad, and it will not let the clothes have some BAR tobacco and alcohol flavor. Overall, it is a well -textured BAR.The bartender itself is also good."
"無巧不成書，本來就打算趁這次出遊去人生第二次酒吧
結果太太先開口說想去找酒吧
於是就隨便搜了一間在附近的
雖說下著不小的雨，還是撐傘走路過去

入口在地下室，很有電影裡面那種祕密酒吧的感覺
但不是那種懂滋懂滋的酒吧
音樂很好聽

酒單超級專業的只有英文，第一杯我點liquid bread
本以為是波本基底，
後來和酒保聊天才發現我根本點錯，這是琴酒基底
其實應該用上次那個酒保教我的
不懂就請酒保推薦適合的

誤打誤撞就解鎖琴酒初體驗
沒辦法我才第二次上酒吧啊

邊喝邊上網惡補資訊
發現這家店不會把經典調酒放酒單上，只會放他們獨創的
簡單來說就是要測顧客的能耐

而且據說是台北十大推薦酒吧之一
才第二次上酒吧，這門檻未免太頂了

第二杯就跟酒保說我人生第一杯是「教父」
能否推薦我類似的
就得到這杯他們獨創的經典款「old fashion」

好像從人中之龍走出來的帥哥酒保還倒一點波本讓我開開眼界

第一次和太太在這種地方聊天，老實說很有趣
也談了一些平時不太會聊的話題

期間還看到新人酒保不斷練習搖酒的技巧
這才發現當家酒保搖酒技術超猛，上半身都不會晃
本來想說指名新人給他機會練習，但怕壞了規矩作罷

我們一坐就坐了快三小時，但感覺好像進入異世界
有夠超現實的

下次我想反璞歸真點威士忌加冰塊就可以了
（其實是怕丟臉）

#mudbar","I have no coincidence, I originally planned
As a result, the wife first said she wanted to find a bar
So I just searched a nearby one nearby
Although there is a small rain, I still walk over the umbrella

The entrance is in the basement, there is a feeling of the secret bar in the movie
But it is not the kind of bar that knows and nourish
Music is nice

The only wine list is only English. The first cup I order liquid break
I thought it was the Ben Ben Base,
Later, I talked to Jiu Bao to find that I was wrong at all. This is the base of Qinjiu
In fact, I should teach me the last time that the wine guarantees me
If you don’t understand, please recommend the suitable for the suitable

Unlock the piano wine at the beginning of the unlocked by accident
I can't go to the bar for the second time

Drink while surfing the Internet
I found that this shop will not put the classic bartending and drinking list, it will only put them exclusively
Simply put, it is to test the ability of customers

And it is said to be one of the top ten recommended bars in Taipei
Only the second time in the bar, this threshold is too top

The second cup told Jiu Bao that my first cup in life was ""Godfather""
Can I recommend me similar
Get this unique classic ""Old Fashion""

It seems that the handsome guy who came out of the man's dragon also poured a little bit of a wave of Ben let me open the horizon

The first time I was chatting with my wife in such a place, honestly, it is very interesting
I also talked about some topics that I usually don't talk about

During the period, I also saw the skills of newcomers' wine insurance constantly practicing the skills of shaking wine
Then I found that the technique of liquor and shaking wine is super fierce, and the upper body will not shake
I wanted to say that the newcomer gave him a chance to practice, but I was afraid of breaking the rules.

We sat for almost three hours as soon as we sat, but it felt like entering a different world
Againful

Next time I want to fight back to the true order of whiskey, just add ice cubes
(Actually, I'm afraid of shame)

#mudbar"
酒很好喝，也很認真調，也會反覆確認風味或個人喜好，有備受重視的尊榮感，整體氛圍很喜歡，頗推薦的！👍🏽主任Wawa很親民，服務也非常周到，很喜歡、很舒服！,"The wine is delicious, and it is very serious. It will also repeatedly confirm the flavor or personal preferences. There is a sense of honor that has attracted much attention. The overall atmosphere is very popular.Director Wawa is very close to the people, the service is also very thoughtful, I like it very much and comfortable!"
"一定會想要再來的酒吧
跟以往Bar店內風格完全不同，可以讓人覺得非常自在舒適的跟朋友們聊天。
服務人員介紹專業，態度超好，還會關心調酒是否有無需要改正地方。
免費提供爆米花","Will definitely want to come again
It is completely different from the previous BAR store style, which can make people feel very comfortable and comfortable to chat with friends.
The service staff introduces majors, and the attitude is super good, and they will also care about whether there is a place to correct the bartender.
Provide popcorn for free"
"因為上台北出差住酒吧的意舍酒店，之前都是住西門館，但因西門館整修所以改住中山，卻碰巧的知道這家酒吧，跟西門館不同的是，西門館的酒吧比較小，能喝的酒有限，但這家完全就是另一個世界。

Server跟Bartender都很熱心，聊個幾分鐘後就像朋友一樣，且店內也完全禁菸，這樣身上也不會殘留菸味，店內也有很多來自不同國家的人，整體環境跟印象中的酒吧稍微不一樣。","Because the Yishe Hotel in Taipei lived in the bar, I used to stay in the Ximen Pavilion before, but because of the renovation of the Ximen Pavilion, I changed to Zhongshan, but I happened to know that this bar. Unlike the Ximen Pavilion, the bar in the Ximen Pavilion is relatively small. The wine that can drink is limited, but this one is completely another world.

Server and Bartnder are very enthusiastic. After talking for a few minutes, they are like friends, and smoking is completely banned in the store. In this way, there will be no smoke smell on the body. There are also many people from different countries. Same."
調酒都很經典，服務很好，音樂恰到好處。,"The bartending is very classic, the service is very good, and the music is just right."
服務人員十分積極，是有溫度的服務，不過可惜取消了實體酒單改成QR code，另外週五週六有低消600的規定須注意，私心希望週末DJ時間可以提前到九點，整體空間感十足，台北最喜歡的酒吧,"The service staff is very active and has a temperature service, but unfortunately the physical wine list is canceled to QR Code. In addition, there will be a regulation of low 600 low -consumption 600 on Friday and Saturday. Feeling full, Taipei's favorite bar"
"K經理服務很貼心！
交通便利，薯條很好吃😋酒也很好喝🍸","Manager K service is very intimate!
Convenient transportation, fries are delicious and delicious."
英文酒單，也可以直接跟店員說想喝的口味，價格約400-450。舒適的空間，音樂稍微大聲，聊天可能還是要將音量拉高,"The English wine list can also tell the store directly about the taste of drinking, the price is about 400-450.A comfortable space, the music is slightly loud, the chat may still be pulled up"
"生日似乎來錯地方～應該要好好在家
自己買個酒和吃的，
跟家人朋友好好放鬆就好

這次經驗有覺得實在是把錢拿來好好佈置家裡，在家即可欸

雖然他們服務人員人都蠻nice、空間還算可以～廁所淨白、乾淨，適合拍照的廁所🚽

QR 扣點餐有夠難點，還要掃描3個扣😂
然後炸物送來溫冷，油超多、超膩⋯⋯
說真的我自己在家用氣炸鍋都實際點
只有腿翅免強還可以
無酒精氣泡飲系列真的很像感冒糖漿，後勁像嘔吐味～～～～～

音樂也真的很不行，除了銜接不上，連結不順，還有炸耳⋯⋯⋯⋯
建議直接插手機撥放就好～～～～省事一些
帥哥直接陪大家喝酒就好

希望這間店可以留意這些，再提升啦
畢竟也是
3人，3杯喝的、拼盤、2項炸物
阿捏平均一人800～900左右

這年頭開店不易
竟然都經營了～～～希望能夠調整更好
好好經營下去","The birthday seems to be coming to the wrong place ~ should be at home
Buy a wine and eat it yourself,
Just relax with your family and friends

This experience is that I really use the money to set up the home well, and you can 欸 at home.

Although the people in the service staff are quite nice, the space is okay ~ the toilet is clean and clean, suitable for the toilet for taking pictures 🚽

QR deduction is difficult enough, and 3 buckles need to be scanned
Then the fried objects are warm, so many oil, super greasy, super greasy ...
Seriously, I am actual in my home gas fryer.
Only the legs and wings are not strong
Wine -free gas bubble drink series is really like a cold syrup, the stamina is like vomiting ~~~~~

The music is really not good. In addition to the uninterrupted connection, the connection is not smooth, and there are fried ears ...
It is recommended to plug in the mobile phone directly ~~~ Save more trouble
Handsome guy just drink directly with everyone

I hope this store can pay attention to these and improve it again
After all, too
Three people, 3 cups, tags, 2 fried objects
Average is about 800 ~ 900 average person

It's not easy to open a store this year
It's all operating ~~~ I hope it can be adjusted better
Go well"
"整體環境乾淨，音樂讓人很舒服，也不太會影響人與人之間的聊天。
基本上桌與桌之前有一小段距離，店家在特定區域有使用門簾做隔絕。
在店內可以任意選擇坐吧台或是底下座位，吧台比較明亮而且可以看到調酒手法。基本上一桌大約適合3~4人，人太多反而距離會偏遠。
因為到晚上10點才有DJ，不是很了解DJ的時段（沒有特定公告）。
酒有各式各樣價位大約在350~550之間，不會太貴且適合小啄聊天。","The overall environment is clean, the music is very comfortable, and it does not affect the chat between people.
Basically, there is a short distance from the desk and the table. The store uses curtains to isolate in specific areas.
You can choose to take the bar or the seats at will in the store.Basically, a table is about 3 to 4 people, but too many people will be far away.
Because there is only DJ until 10 pm, I don't know how to know the time of DJ (no specific announcement).
There are a variety of prices between 350 ~ 550, which will not be too expensive and suitable for small pecking chat."
"這裡使用非常有品質的材料調製出美酒，是有專業技術、親切服務，且環境氣氛都非常棒的酒吧，已來訪數次。

即使是餐飲業會很崩潰的人潮滿滿跨年夜，昨晚mud的服務與提供的酒還是一流，太厲害了👍

酒吧將在2020年起供應點心，昨晚有幸試吃到。裹著開心果粒的起司球口感濃郁，非常好吃，堅果起司與火腿也很好，但美中不足的是巧克力慕斯上的餅乾不新鮮有點油耗味，希望正式販售時能夠注意。","Here is a very high -quality material to prepare wine. It is a bar with professional technology, friendly services, and the environmental atmosphere. It has been visited several times.

Even if the catering industry will collapse, the crowd is full of New Year's Eve. Last night, MUD's service and the wine provided were still first -class, too powerful 👍

Bar will supply snacks since 2020, and I was fortunate to try it last night.The cheese balls wrapped in happy fruits are strong, very delicious, and the nut cheese and ham are also very good."
"剛好聖誕節附近來 氣氛很不得了
店家特調非常好喝 只是調酒師非常的忙 你可能會喝到用左手stir的調酒","The atmosphere is incredible near Christmas
The store is very delicious, but the bartender is very busy. You may drink it with the left hand sTir's bartender"
"👍空間舒適有設計感（廁所超大），走現代工業風，星期六晚上有DJ播歌，氣氛好。
👎酒偏貴（一杯400-500），味道並無特別驚豔，Brooklyn 與old fashion 喝起來幾乎一樣⋯而且第一次遇到不太願意給水的bar(三個人只願意給兩杯） …","设计 The space is comfortable and design (large toilet). It takes a modern industrial style. There is a DJ broadcast on Saturday night. The atmosphere is good.
The wine is expensive (a cup of 400-500), and the taste is not particularly amazing. Brooklyn is almost the same as OLD FASHION. For the first time, he encountered BAR, who was not willing to give water (three people were willing to give two cups) ..."
"點餐點酒要用手機掃Qr code，點完馬上收走，然後有朋友再點又要再跟服務生要Qr code，為何不留一張還是桌面都貼一張方便客人呢？ 實在造成大家麻煩…
薯條的氣味很濃厚，就連隔了兩桌的距離都超重，會有點影響到別桌客人喝酒吃東西的感受。
DJ存在感太低了，雖然站在那邊搖頭晃腦，但音樂其實跟直接播唱片差不多，只多了歌曲的銜接，選歌品味也…
椅子也不好坐，跟朋友們都坐沒多久就坐不住了。
優點大概是廁所很寬敞，工業風加上全身鏡，很適合網美拍照。","Sweep the QR Code with a mobile phone, pick away it immediately after ordering, and then some friends want to ask the waiter to ask the waiter QR Code. Why not leave one or a desktop with a convenient guest?It really causes everyone to trouble ...
The smell of fries is very strong. Even the distance between the two tables is overweight, which will affect the feeling of drinking and eating by other table guests.
The presence of DJ is too low. Although standing over there and shaking his head, the music is actually similar to the direct record of the record. Only the connection of the songs is more.
The chair is not easy to sit, and I can't sit still before I sit with my friends.
The advantage is that the toilet is very spacious, industrial style and full -body mirror, which is very suitable for taking pictures of the net."
"Red Viper很有泰味，好喝！
炸雞米花也好吃！
單價偏高的水平。","Red Viper is very tadpole and delicious!
Fried chicken rice flowers are also delicious!
High -price level."
"店面隱密、環境空間舒適，每個座位之間間隔蠻大，很有個人的隱私空間。

店家的特調大致上是清爽易飲型，價格偏中高價，整體上還不錯，但是屬於不會特地造訪的店家","The store is secretive and the environmental space is comfortable. The interval between each seat is quite large, and there is a personal privacy space.

The special adjustment of the store is roughly refreshing and easy to drink, the price is high, and the overall is not bad, but it belongs to the store that will not be visited."
"氣氛真的非常好
酒好喝，服務態度好！
適合常來小酌的地方
地方不太好找","The atmosphere is really good
Good wine, good service attitude!
Suitable for the place where you often drink
The place is not easy to find"
"雖然酒單上的酒沒有很多，但可以依照客人需求做特調。
店家內部空間蠻大，燈光不會太暗氛圍很不錯，調酒好喝不會有過多裝飾，bartender友善好聊，是不論獨自一人或跟朋友一起小酌都適合的地方。","Although there are not many wines on the wine list, they can be special according to the needs of guests.
The interior space of the store is quite large, and the lights will not be too dark atmosphere. There will be no too much decoration and drinking. Bartender is friendly and good. It is a place where you are alone or with friends."
好客！雞尾酒精緻有個性,hospitable!Cocktails are exquisite and individual
在Amba酒店下旁邊巷子，店開的位置剛好在其它星級酒店附近，外觀上是一黑大門很低調，進入後發現現場氣氛調性偏暗不如照片上調過偏亮，但氣氛很好，調酒中高價約400元。朋友選的水果調酒好喝，我選的調酒聞起很香像肥皂，入口太酸不適合我。很可惜。,"At the alley next to the AMBA Hotel, the store is just near other star hotels. The appearance is very low -key in appearance. After entering, it is found that the atmosphere is darker than the photos are not as bright as the photos are brighter, but the atmosphere is very good. The high price of wine is about 400 yuan.Friends chosen fruit alcohol is delicious. The bartender I chose smells very fragrant like soap. The entrance is too sour for me.it is a pity."
一間位於地下室的飯店酒吧，裝潢走得是極簡的工業風，吧台位置沒有椅背，坐起來不舒適，會提供爆米花為小食，當天點了menu 上的兩杯調酒，Bastard Grey喝起來感覺還不錯，然而甜度較高又搭配蛋白，喝起來過於膩口，，Dragon Well喝起來感覺還不錯微甜微酸帶一些淡淡的藥草味，然而garnish 為在杯中的冰塊上面灑著茶葉，在沒有吸管的狀態下飲用，不是茶葉灑在飲料中，要不就是沾著嘴唇都是茶葉，喝起來有一點點不舒適，調酒偏貴，吧台較擠且無椅背的狀況下，在飲酒的整個過程中不算舒適,"A restaurant bar in the basement, the decoration is a minimalist industrial style. There is no chair back in the bar. It is uncomfortable to sit up and will provide popcorn as a snack. I ordered two cups of bartending on Menu that day. It feels pretty good, but the sweetness is higher and paired with protein, which is too greasy to drink. Dragon Well feels good and slightly sweet and sour with some faint herbs. However Drinking tea in the state of tea, not tea sprinkled in the drink, or the lips are covered with tea, it is a little uncomfortable to drink, the bartender is too expensive, the bar is crowded and the back of the chair has no chair back. Below, it is not comfortable during the whole process of drinking"
泰國咖哩口味的酒曾經喝過酒裡最特被的酒。香料的味道很香。,Thai curry -flavored wine once drank the most special wine in wine.The flavor of spices is very fragrant.
地點在意舍的轉角處，空間設計很有趣，服務生與調酒師都是顏質高的賞心悅目，音樂氣氛融洽，晚點會有DJ放音樂，跟隨酒精十分放鬆,"Location is in the corner of the corner, the space design is very interesting, service students and bartenders are very high-the-faced insurance, the music atmosphere is harmonious, how can some DJ release music, follow alcohol very relaxed"
很喜歡這間bar營造的氣氛，空間感很不錯，bartender 跟之前來的時候不一樣，但親切許多，超加分，雖然因為客人較多等了蠻久，但很值得。記得在酒喝到一半的時候點下一杯XD 才不會等那麼久,"I like the atmosphere created by this BAR very much. The sense of space is very good. Bartender is different from the time when I came, but it is much more friendly and super extra points. Although I have waited for a long time, it is worth it.Remember to order the next cup of XD when you drink halfway to drink."
"調酒讓我沒有很驚艷，還蠻一般。
炸物普通，薯條不是我愛的😜 …","I am not amazing and quite average.
The fried object is ordinary, and the fries are not my love ..."
很舒適的環境，很不錯。泰式調酒很棒，謝謝,"Very comfortable environment, very good.Thai bartender is great, thank you"
"好喝又有特色的自創調酒❤️給5顆星都不夠🌟
服務人員很親切也會詢問合不合口感
爆米花🍿️好吃😂也不會搶掉調酒的味道
氣氛非常好👍🏻人雖然多但也不會吵雜很適合小酌
而且廁所超明亮超乾淨的，這很重要
當天（禮拜五晚上）還有Dj撥放音樂
ㄧ入門就能有非凡的感受","Drough and distinctive self -made bartending ❤️ It is not enough to give 5 stars 🌟
The service staff is very kind and will ask if it is not a sense of mouth
Popcorn 🍿️ delicious 🍿 will not snatch the taste of bartending
The atmosphere is very good.
And the toilet is super bright and super clean, which is very important
On the same day (Friday night), there are DJ dialing music
You can have extraordinary feelings when you enter the door"
"服務跟環境都很棒
重點是食物跟飲品都蠻普通的","The service and the environment are great
The point is that food and drinks are quite ordinary"
"氣氛不錯 酒的層次也有明顯感受 蠻推薦小聚會可以來喝一喝

很有氣氛，也沒有網路看起來這麼亮
價位中等","Good service and convenient transportation
There are many specialty wines, and Longjing wine is also delicious
Very atmospheric, nor the Internet looks so bright
Medium price"
"不會把音樂放太大聲的酒吧，音響和喇叭頗為高級，但可能是房間不大，聲音不是該有的乾淨與清爽！

生意相當不錯，低消$600，每杯約$400-500不等，點上兩杯剛好！

年輕人居多，感覺客人也較為單存，相對覺得比較安全！","The bar that will not put the music too loudly is quite advanced, but it may be that the room is not large, and the sound is not clean and refreshing!

The business is pretty good, low to 600 lows, ranging from about $ 400-500 per cup, click two cups!

Young people are mostly, and they feel that guests are relatively single, and they feel relatively safer!"
"期待已久的探訪，原先早已計劃給出五星的評論，無奈最後只能忍痛給出三星，希望二訪時能讓我刪掉這次評論。
先說優點吧，
空間和座位十分舒服，有種慵懶舒適的氛圍
酒的部分，味道很細緻，我點的Bastard Grey上半部的fizz非常細緻層次豐富，一飲而盡毫無問題
現場的DJ和音響讓整個空間舒適的氛圍更加分，音響的細節性也很高，癱坐在椅子上喝酒聽音樂簡直享受
再來說到缺點，各一顆星🌟
🌟1. 和友人一同點了三杯調酒，等了約15分鐘，友人們的兩杯調酒都來了，我第一次走去吧檯詢問我的調酒，Bartender 請我等等。再過了20分鐘，我的酒還沒來，按耐不住酒精的癮頭，再次走向吧檯詢問，這次是另一位服務生回我，他說正在做了，要我再等等。再過了15分鐘，酒精的癮頭已經充斥我的全身，我又走向吧檯，這次第一位的Bartender 竟問我是要再點一杯嗎？？？我不知道他們中間的溝通出了什麼問題，總之過了一個小時，我終於獲得我的調酒。
🌟2. 結帳時，我的友人問了是否能各自結帳，服務生忽然臉一垮，用著挺為憤恨的語氣說到「你們想怎麼結」，我不知道那位服務生的一天過得如何，也許挺糟的。但其實若真的不方便，也有其他的說法，不一定要擺出這樣的態度吧，或許是說公司的規定無法讓你拆單，又或者說你單子已經印出，這樣會要等比較久，我想明理的人都不會再繼續刁難吧。

希望下次再訪的體驗，能讓我收回這則評論，加油💪","The long -awaited visit, originally planned to give five -star comments, helplessly could only endure Samsung, hoping that I could delete this comment during the second visit.
Let's talk about the advantages first,
Space and seats are very comfortable, there is a lazy and comfortable atmosphere
The wine part is very delicate. The FIZZ in the upper half of the Bastard Grey I ordered is very detailed and rich.
The DJ and audio at the scene make the comfortable atmosphere of the entire space more divided, and the details of the audio are also very high. Sitting on a chair to drink and listen to music
Besides the shortcomings, one star 🌟 each
一1. I had three cups of bartending with my friends. After waiting for about 15 minutes, the two cups of bartender of my friends came. For the first time, I went to the bar to ask my bartender, Bartender asked me, etc.After another 20 minutes, my wine hadn't come yet. I couldn't bear the addiction of alcohol, and went to the bar again. This time, another waiter returned to me. He said he was doing it, and I wanted me to wait.After 15 minutes, the addiction of alcohol has flooded my whole body, and I went to the bar again. This time Bartender, the first place, asked me if I wanted to order another cup?IntersectionIntersectionI don't know what problems with their communication between them. In short, after an hour, I finally got my bartending.
我 2. When checking out, my friends asked if they could check out each other. The waiter suddenly collapsed and said ""how do you want to get married"" in a resentful tone. How about it, it may be quite bad.But in fact, if it is really inconvenient, there are other claims. You don't have to put on such an attitude. Perhaps it is said that the company’s rules cannot let you dismantle the bill, or you have printed it, so you will have to wait a long time. , I do n’t want to make sense anymore.

I hope the next visit experience will allow me to take back this comment and refuel"
"這邊沒有供餐，只有爆米花，記得吃飽再來～
酒品好喝氣氛佳","There is no meal here, only popcorn, remember to get full ~
The wine is delicious and the atmosphere is good"

如果不知道自己喜歡哪種酒品，店員會依每個人喜歡的不同種類建議或調酒。依專業推薦真的都點到每個人自己滿意的專屬味道。,"If you don't know which wine he likes, the clerk will refer to or bartender depending on the different types of everyone's favorite.Based on professional recommendations, you really order the exclusive taste that everyone is satisfied with."
"個人非常喜歡的一家pub, 調酒很合個人喜好。如果酒單上沒你要的，也可以跟吧檯調酒師溝通。","I really like a PUB, and bartending is very personal.If you do n’t want it on the wine list, you can also communicate with the barbecan."
整體風格舒適，喝的這杯有清酒為主題我非常喜歡，薯條炸的酥脆爽口很讚，入口處是在飯店側面巷子，要找一下❤️,The overall style is comfortable. I like this cup of sake as the theme. I like it very much. The fried fried fried crispy and refreshing is very good. The entrance is on the side of the hotel.
"大家點的酒都不錯，不會太差，但是要等超久

我們的位子在最裡面，還有一個像是清國人吸鴉片側躺的床
兩面靠牆、一面靠簾幕，另一邊是被別組的沙發坐擋住
其實簾幕蠻好的，可以吸音，但還是覺得聽不太清楚朋友的說話聲

整體空間還蠻寬敞的
廁所值得再加一顆星
DJ表演很無感，像是一個人站在DJ台搖頭晃腦。音樂是有比較大聲，但感受度沒有很強","Everyone ordered the wine is good, it will not be too bad, but wait for a long time

Our seat is in the innermost, and there is a bed like the Qing Dynasty lying on the side of the Qing Dynasty.
On both sides against the wall, one side of the curtain, and the other side are blocked by the sofa of other groups.
In fact, the curtain is pretty good, you can absorb sound, but you still feel that you don't know how to speak well.

The overall space is quite spacious
The toilet is worth adding a star
The DJ performance is very unsightly, as if standing alone on DJ platform and shaking his head.The music is relatively loud, but the feeling is not very strong"
"椅子很舒服，適合久坐小酌的酒吧😉
調酒一杯平均四百上下，不算便宜但氣氛、空間感都有不錯的品質，會再來！ …","The chair is very comfortable, suitable for a long sedentary bar 😉

這間也是友人推薦給我的口袋名單，入口非常不起眼，像是大樓的側門逃生口之類的哈哈哈，進去後下樓就可以看到了，但酒很好喝，服務生會耐心介紹，我們是週六晚上去的，現場還有DJ在播歌，氣氛滿好的！廁所是白色裝潢也非常寬敞又乾淨明亮，很酷的廁所！裡面座位滿多的，座位與座位間不擁擠，所以感覺非常舒服，酒的部分平均在$400～500間，這價位似乎在台北滿普遍的⋯所以還能夠接受！但營業時間只到凌晨2點，要暢聊的要自己斟酌一下，因為我們還續攤去下一間。我喝的是帶有茶味的調酒，唯一一杯是用龍井茶製作的，非常特別！很順很好喝！,"This is also a list of pockets recommended for my friends. The entrance is very inconspicuous, like the side door escape from the building, hahaha, you can see it after you enter, but the wine is delicious, and the waiter will introduce it patiently. We went on Saturday night, and there were DJs on the scene. The atmosphere was good!The toilet is also very spacious, clean and bright, and cool to the toilet!There are a lot of seats inside, and the seats and seats are not crowded, so it feels very comfortable. The average part of the wine is $ 400 to 500. This price seems to be universal in Taipei, so it can be accepted!But the business hours are only 2 am, and we must consider ourselves, because we continue to spread the next room.I drink a drink with tea. The only cup is made of Longjing tea, which is very special!Very smooth and delicious!"

點了伯爵跟龍井的特調介紹說是微甜，喝起來卻很酸，跟服務生反應說有點酸服務生回我這是微甜，結帳時再跟八天德反應覺得剛剛的酒蠻酸的又跟我說微甜，我想我跟友人的味覺都壞掉了，第一次調酒一杯喝半小時喝不完的，第一次反應了也不願調整或更換的店家，很可惜價格對不上服務！,"The special introduction of the count and Longjing said that it was slightly sweet, but it was very sour when it was drinking. It responded to the waiter that it was a bit sweet to return to me. This was slightly sweet. At the checkout, I reacted with eight days. The sour one told me slightly sweet. I think my taste and my friends have broken. For the first time, I couldn't drink it for a while for a while for a while. Unfortunately, the price is not serving!"
服務超好 氣氛也讚👍,The service is super good atmosphere and praise

但真的希望他們在假日的時間
人手可以多排一些

真的太久了🥲
然後還要收服務費","The bartender is good and the atmosphere is also good

調酒看似很簡單沒有過多的裝飾，但是喝下去很舒服，音樂也很舒服，服務人員很熱情介紹調酒，讓人有一個愉快的夜晚。,"The alcohol seems to be simple and not too much decoration, but it is very comfortable to drink, the music is very comfortable, the service staff is very enthusiastic about the bartender, which makes people have a pleasant night."
熱情如火K經理，五星好評！,"Passion like fire manager K, five -star praise!"

氣氛很棒 空間寬敞 如果你有約會對象帶來就對了,"The atmosphere is great and spacious. If you have a date object, it is right."
"十點多到十一點多是人潮比較多的時候。
門是黑色的一開始可能不好找，然後往下走。
菜單比較多說威士忌的調酒，當然也有其他基底的像是琴酒、伏特加等。
調酒有收一成的服務費。
評論都有爆米花但我去的時候是沒有提供的。
酒大概在400上下 （加服務費就440）
調酒蠻多選擇的。
我禮拜六去的時候只有點一杯，沒有像其他家限制抵消500以上之類的。","From ten o'clock to eleven o'clock, there are more people.
The door may be difficult to find at first, and then go down.
The menu is more about whiskey's bartending, of course, there are other bases such as piano wine and vodka.
There is a 10 % service fee for bartending.
There are popcorn at the comments, but I did not provide it when I went.
The wine is about 400 (440 increases the service fee)
There are many choices for bartending.
I only had a cup when I went on Saturday, and there was no restriction on other homes to offset more than 500."
環境不錯， bartender也健談，調酒還好，沒有很驚艷，價位算高了,"The environment is good, Bartender is also talking, it's okay to bartender, not amazing, the price is high, the price is high"
"調酒好喝、有特色，有爆米花可以跟朋友邊吃邊喝邊聊，很舒適。但是調酒要有耐心等待、想喝水的話要多提醒幾次～假日沒有低消也是一大優點👍
*此為1月初來訪經驗 …","The bartending is delicious and distinctive. There are popcorn that can talk to friends while drinking and drinking, which is very comfortable.However, if you have to wait patiently, you need to remind you a few more times if you want to drink water ~ No low on holiday is also a big advantage.
*This is the experience of visiting in early January ..."
"酒好喝有層次
Bartender 很專業，坐吧臺看他們調酒是一種享受
音樂好聽舒服
是一個令人放鬆的店
超推","Good wine and layered

The music is nice and comfortable
Is a relaxed shop

女服務生Wawa人非常好，也很專業，推薦的酒都很好喝👍👍👍 …,"Women's waiter Wawa is very good and professional, and the recommended wine is delicious ..."
有舒適的獨立空間、乾淨的廁所，酒保會流利的英語，推薦帶外國朋友來坐坐,"There are comfortable and independent space, clean toilets, fluent English of wine guarantee, and recommended foreign friends to sit sitting"
有DJ放音樂適合TGIF想放鬆一下的朋友，調酒的部分還行不過價位比較高一點點（沒到離譜），最大優點應該是燈光氣氛座位很舒適，即使坐吧臺也不會很擠～,There are DJ music for friends who want to relax. The part of the bartending part is better than the price (not out of time). The biggest advantage should be that the light atmosphere is very comfortable.
"好喝一直喝，喜歡這邊的氛圍
調酒真的也好喝","Drink all the time, like the atmosphere here
Blooming is really delicious"
首先客觀的說，這次點的每杯酒，味道上都過於單調，沒有什麼特色，再來是服務生介紹的味道、酒感，都與實際喝起來差很多，然後某位女服務生的態度非常差，卻還要一成的服務費，菜單上的餐點有些寫提供到凌晨一點，同行的不喝酒，體諒店家想多點些餐點，但被告知廚房都提早休息了，必須點酒抵消，一開始請服務生倒水沒問題，但後來服務態度不好的那位女服務生第二次來的時候就不給我們倒水了，而說會附上爆米花，也沒有提供，整體而言實在是不好的體驗。,"First of all, objectively speaking, each glass of wine at this time is too monotonous in the taste. There is no characteristic. Then it is the taste and wine introduced by the waiter. It is very bad, but it has to be a service fee. The meals on the menu are written to one o'clock in the early morning. Do n’t drink alcohol. The store is considered to have more meals, but the kitchen was told. Cancelled, it was okay to ask the waiter to pour water at first, but the female waiter who had a poor service attitude later did not pour water when he came for the second time. It would be attached to the popcorn, which was not provided. It's a bad experience."
環境跟氣氛都很舒適，酒好喝，店員超熱情！,"The environment and atmosphere are very comfortable, the wine is good, the clerk is very enthusiastic!"
氣氛很讚，音樂很讓人放鬆～店員介紹酒單很詳細很了解，調酒跟烈酒也都很好喝～,"The atmosphere is very good, the music is very relaxed ~ The clerk introduces the wine list very detailed and well, and the bartending and liquor are also delicious ~"
kk主理人是混血吧…..帥！服務也很好,KK the principal is a mixed race ... handsome!The service is also very good
空間寬敞舒適，調酒有水準,"The space is spacious and comfortable, and the bartending is standardized"
氣氛好，調酒專業！不過我覺得價錢略貴一些。,"Good atmosphere, sommelier!But I think the price is slightly more expensive."
Wawa服務很讚 介紹調酒都好喝👍🏼,WAWA service is very good to introduce bartending is delicious 👍🏼
調酒風味很細緻 氛圍很好 值得來,"The flavor of the bartender is very delicate atmosphere, it is worth coming"
"非常值得再訪的點，
每一杯調酒都讓人覺得驚喜。

只是出酒的速度有點慢，
但酒上了又會忘記等待的感覺～
期待再訪！","Very worth visiting point,
Each cup of bartending is surprising.

It's just that the speed of wine is a bit slow,
But you will forget the feeling of waiting ~
Looking forward to visiting again!"

"週末和朋友聚會，提前預訂了4個位置。
到現場後臨時有一位朋友也想來一起享用餐點～
我們詢問了是否可以多加一個位置，店員也貼心的說可以！
重點來了：
此店每人低消需要600元！

朋友陸續到，但剛好有一位朋友真的有事臨時不能來
“”然後餐點和酒都出的非常慢！“”
因為真的等太久了，一位朋友想先行離開！
詢問店員餐點狀況，他說餐點較多還在排～
想說還沒做的話就取消餐點他先離開！
也順便結帳，竟然說要結五位的低消！
說四位我們也就算了，說要結五位！？
這是在坑人嗎？！
實際人數4位重點還有一位根本沒點到餐點！
要收五位的低消！？
根本黑店～

如果有要來此店，請注意唷～","Weekends meet with friends on weekends and book 4 places in advance.
After arriving at the scene, there was a friend who wanted to come to enjoy the meal together ~
We asked if you could add one more position, and the clerk also said intimately!
The focus is:
Each person in this shop requires 600 yuan!

Friends have arrived one after another, but just a friend really can't come temporarily
"""" Then the meal and wine came out very slowly!""""
Because I really waited too long, a friend wanted to leave first!
Ask the clerk's meals, he said that the meal is more lined up ~
If you want to say that if you have n’t done it, he will leave the meal and leave first!
By the way, it was said that the five lows would be formed!

沒有煙味，可以很自在地品酒，調酒風味極佳。,"Without smoke, you can taste wine very freely, and the flavor of bartending is excellent."
價格落在400-450，雖然比一般貴，但氣氛很好，也不會覺得擁擠，推薦給朋友小酌聊天,"The price falls at 400-450, although it is more expensive, but the atmosphere is very good, and I will not feel crowded. I recommend chatting with friends for a drinking chat"

假日僅現場候位，但位置不會很擠，適合三五好友晚上來小酌一杯！,"Only on the spot on holidays, but the position will not be crowded. It is suitable for three or five friends to have a drink at night!"
很棒的酒吧。氣氛好，很有1930的味道。可惜 bartender 一直忘記我點的餐點。,"A great bar.The atmosphere is good, it has a taste of 1930.Unfortunately, Bartender has always forgotten the meal I ordered."
服務很差很慢還要付服務費嗎？那你就被迫花600台幣？一家好的酒吧不會強迫人們買飲料，也不會故意放慢服務速度。,"Do you have to pay the service fee when the service is poor and slow?Then you are forced to spend 600 Taiwan dollars?A good bar will not force people to buy drinks, nor will it deliberately slow down the service."
第一次來，很適合三五好友喝酒放鬆,"For the first time, it is very suitable for three or five friends to drink and relax"

但2/26 00:30 DJ播放的音樂風格實在讓人難以接受，銜接也非常難聽

主要最大的問題就是

希望服務生多主動注意想要點餐的客人","The food is delicious and delicious, and the environment is very comfortable

But the music style played by 2/26 00:30 DJ is really unacceptable, and the connection is very ugly.

The most important problem is

第一次有一間酒吧能讓我想天天去！,"For the first time, there was a bar that made me want to go every day!"
酒好喝，環境不錯，適合三五好友聚會打屁,"The wine is delicious, the environment is good, suitable for three or five friends gatherings to fart"
點了Cheese盤等了半小時，中間問了服務生3次，每一次都說正在做了，結果半小時後終於送上來了，內容物非常平庸，起士根本都沒認真切，麵包零星幾片，不懂花半小時的這中間店家在忙什麼。另外點的爆米花，也是直接ㄧ個袋子直接送上了，問服務生能否提供碗或盤子，服務生只回：「我們這邊都不提供餐具」這樣的品質與服務，要低消600，覺得是花錢找罪受,"After ordering cheese for half an hour, I asked the waiter 3 times in the middle. Every time I said it was doing it, the result was finally sent after half an hour. The content of the content was very mediocre. The film, I don't understand what this intermediate shop is busy for half an hour.In addition, the popcorn that ordered it was also directly delivered to the bag directly. Ask the waiter if he could provide a bowl or plate, the waiter only returned: ""We do not provide tableware here."" I think it is to spend money to find a crime"

氣氛很好，調酒有特色，服務生娃娃專業又可愛，有這個員工太超值，老闆要幫娃娃加薪啦！這樣才能留住好人才。,"The atmosphere is very good, the bartending is unique, the waiter doll is professional and cute. This employee is too worthy. The boss wants to help the doll raise!This can retain good talents."
如果可以給負的，我一定給負分！我們三個人過去消費，當天只剩吧台，因此我們從一進門就和店員講好，如有桌位會幫我們換。陸陸續續有空桌，因為客人也一直進來所以沒幫我們換就算了，後來有三個空桌，也較無新客再入場，我們請店員幫忙換，對方表示會協助收桌，等了半天最後又變成被別人坐走。我們與吧台反應這個狀況（我們口氣並無不好），卻得到一位名叫Dylan的經理的耍流氓式的嗆聲，嗆說不然我們想怎樣？態度極度惡劣！事後其他調酒師有來道歉請我們不要在意（他們人都不錯，以及感覺他們都對於那位經理的態度不以為然...）請問那位經理，這樣的服務態度是對的嗎？我們只是反應了這個狀況，卻要被耍流氓的態度嗆聲，請問這是星級酒店附設酒吧應有的服務態度？真的是非常惡劣！,"If you can be buried, I will definitely give a negative score!The three of us used to spend in the past, and there were only bar stations left that day, so we told the clerk as soon as we entered the door. If there is a table, we will help us change.There is a empty table one after another, because the guests have been coming in, so I did n’t help us change it. Later, there were three empty tables, and there were no new customers to enter the venue. We invited the clerk to help change. Half a long time, it turned away by someone else.We responded with the bar (we were not bad), but we got a rogue -style snoring of the manager named Dylan. What do we want?The attitude is extremely bad!Afterwards, other bartenders have come to apologize, please do not care (they are good, and they feel that they do n’t take it for that manager ’s attitude ...) May I ask that manager, is this service attitude right?We just reflect this situation, but we have to be snoring by the hooligan attitude. Is this a service attitude attached to a star hotel?It's really bad!"
KK專業又親切，推推～,"KK professional and kind, push ~"
"服務人員員工訓練不佳
除了沒說原因直接請我們換位置以外，點酒水時也沒有再三確認，導致所點的飲品與想像有落差","Poor service staff and employee training
Except for the reason, please change the position directly, and there is no repeated confirmation when ordering the drink."
已二訪 環境好氣氛好空間很大很有隱私安全感😂 …,"The two visits environment has a good atmosphere and the space is very large, very privacy and security 😂 ..."
氣氛好 服務更好！ 非常推！,Good atmosphere is better!Push!
我愛血腥瑪麗☺️,I love bloody Mary 玛 ️
地方隱密環境寬敞，酒的部分特調的酒單都看起來滿特別的，只是偏貴了所以不會平凡造訪,"The local hidden environment is spacious, and the special wine list of the wine looks special, but it is too expensive, so it will not visit ordinary."
有點價格 氣氛不錯。但我們喝完吃完之後就把東西收走然後要我們買單，買單的時候我把外套放著過去結帳，結果服務生把我的外套拿過來說我忘記了，我轉頭就發現我們的位子被帶下一組客人了... 有沒有那麼急著趕人😂 …,"A little price atmosphere is good.But after we drink after drinking and eat, take things away and then pay for us. When I pay the bill, I put the jacket in the past and checkout. As a result The seat was brought to the next group of guests ... Are you so anxious to catch people ..."
酒架上放滿一些小酒廠的酒， 看著這些陌生又特別的酒，坐在吧檯有一種視覺的享受吧。Bartender等對於酒的認識好深， 調的雞尾酒非常好喝。價錢非常合理。強烈推薦！！,"The wine racks are filled with some wines in small wineries. Looking at these strange and special wines, sitting on the bar have a visual enjoyment.Bartender et al. Know the wine deeply, and the cocktails are very delicious.The price is very reasonable.Recommended strongly!Intersection"
音樂好棒啊！酒也很特別，我點的red viper像是直接擷取泰式酸辣湯的精華酒化。平日晚上來真的覺得很chill，適合聊天,"The music is great!The wine is also very special. The Red Viper I ordered like the essence of Thai -style hot and sour soup is alcoholic.I really feel chill when I come to night, suitable for chatting"
"店面很有特色而且寬敞舒適
調酒種類多
還有爆米花不斷供應
調酒師也都很親切，重點是技術佳，很會調配合適的酒，所以坐在吧台一樣很享受

會想再訪的Bar","The store is very special, spacious and comfortable
There are many types of bartending
There is also popcorn continuously supplying
The bartender is also very kind. The focus is that the technology is good, and it is very good to blend well, so sitting on the bar is also very enjoyable

BAR you want to visit again"
"這三顆星是因為酒好喝
但是說實話 做酒速度真的太慢了
吧台只有三位....
是要做什麼？
去喝酒的....等第一杯酒來..
我中間可以打兩場王者榮耀...一場20-30分鐘！
喝完一杯再打1-2場，第二杯才會來....
沒有效率的一家店！
哥哥，我都冷掉了.........
真的不是很推薦大家來。
唉 阿密陀佛。","These three stars are because the wine is good
But to be honest, the speed of making wine is really too slow
There are only three in the bar ...
What do you want to do?
Go to drink .... Wait for the first glass of wine ..
I can play two king glory in the middle ... 20-30 minutes!
After drinking a cup and playing another 1-2 games, the second cup will come ...
An inefficient shop!
Brother, I have been cold .........
It is really not recommended everyone to come.

Umami放在第一杯可能不太適合，如果有客人要點可能要提前介紹。昆布清酒味道比較突出，配上番茄及苦酒，不是一般經典調酒會出現的口味，酒單不太適合放在第一位，可能後者介紹比較妥，也不太適合主打，比較適合放在特殊調酒。Oolong old fashioned 相對就比較簡單明瞭，由old fashioned 去延伸帶點烏龍的香味，簡單粗暴，後加蜂蜜塊，蜂蜜味出來不甜不膩不蓋味道，但茶味就有點被吃掉，比較適合後面幾杯點的酒，酒感重，酒精濃度高。,"UMAMI may not be suitable for the first cup.Kunbu clearing wine is more prominent. With tomato and bitter wine, it is not the taste of the general classic bartender. The wine list is not suitable for the first place. It may be more suitable for the latter. Special bartending.OOLONG OLD FASHIONED is relatively simple and clear. It is extended from Old Fashioned to extend the fragrance of oolong, simple and rude, and then add honey blocks. A few cups of wine, heavy wine, high alcohol concentration."
"躲藏在飯店B1的地下聖殿，隱密的入口像是員工通道，進去後也是老飯店員工通道，一整個就是讓人問號滿點，懷疑是不是走錯路了。直到進到B1打開黑幕，那個現場DJ、裝潢和酒香味撲鼻而來，完全可以讓你驚豔。這裡沒有提供下酒料理，只有爆米花，所以易醉者，建議吃完再來。很可惜在這裡拍的每張照片都有我或朋友入鏡，就放個Logo，你們自行來尋找吧！這裡真的很適合約會、小聚，隱密又高雅時尚。廁所真的很美，來一定要去廁所。
歡迎追蹤IG: @alcoholneal 來認識更多酒吧","Hidden in the underground temple of the hotel B1, the secret entrance is like an employee passage, and after entering, it is also the passage of the old restaurant employee. One is the full question mark, and I wonder if it is the wrong way.Until entering B1 to open the shady, the scene DJ, decoration and wine fragrance came, which can make you amazing.There are no wine dishes here, only popcorn, so it is easy to get drunk. It is recommended to come back after eating.It is a pity that every photo I took here has me or friends to enter the mirror, just put a logo, let's find it yourself!This is really suitable for dating, small gathering, hidden and elegant and fashionable.The toilet is really beautiful, so you must go to the toilet.

兩次造訪，無論是吧台或是外場對於walk-in的客人敏感度都很高。調酒種類選擇眾多，調酒師主動推薦且親切，口感層次分明、平衡，後勁十足。第二次也許是跨年當天顯得有點忙不過來，ticket time 稍長，建議可以在平常日前往可以有較多時間享受與調酒師有趣及款待的互動,"Two visits, whether it is the bar or out of the field, the guests of Walk-in are highly sensitive.There are many types of alcohol, and the bartender actively recommends and kind, the taste is clear, balanced, and full of stamina.The second time may be a bit too busy on the New Year's Eve. T 4Tt time is slightly longer. It is recommended that you can have more time to enjoy the interesting and hospitable interaction on the usual day."
有氣氛的bar，音樂不會太大聲。,"Bar with atmosphere, music will not be too loud."
非常開心的夜晚，服務跟酒的很優秀，調酒師超nice，謝謝他們讓這夜晚更加完美💕 …,"A very happy night, the service and wine are very good, the bartender super nice, thank you for making the night more perfect ..."

超讚！風格有別於台北市的酒吧!調酒有水準的好喝！服務人員女孩也超親切貼心！,It's amazing!The style is different from the bar in Taipei City! The bartender is delicious!The service staff girls are also super intimate!
週五週六有DJ活動，環境座位舒服，調酒師也都很親切，會再訪,"There is a DJ event on Friday and Saturday, the environment is comfortable, and the bartender is very kind and will visit again."
調酒好喝，但是沒有小點食物搭配小扣分，男生服務員態度不太好，也不太會介紹酒，滿失望的,"The bartending is delicious, but there is no small food with a small deduction. The boys' waiter is not very good, and it is not very disappointing."
四年前來跟四年後來一樣頂,"Four years ago, he came as if four years later"
喝酒好去處，價位中高，畢竟開在飯店樓下，一杯平均400+左右，氣氛很好！適合朋友或情侶來，人太多就算了,"Drink a good place, and the price is high. After all, it is under the restaurant downstairs, with an average cup of about 400+, and the atmosphere is good!Suitable for friends or couples, too many people, even if there are too many people"
Dragon well 好喝，可惜沒有吃的，不然可以喝上好幾杯。空間不錯，有時候放的音樂很對tone(不是DJ的時候 哈）,"Dragon Well is delicious, but unfortunately you don't eat it, otherwise you can drink several cups.The space is good, and sometimes the music is very right for TONE (not DJ haha)"
調酒有創意，味道細緻，音樂好聽，推薦！,"Bart -up is creative, delicate, nice music, recommended!"

氣氛很棒，讓人放鬆又自在，酒的選擇也很多，挺有特色的,"The atmosphere is great, it is relaxed and comfortable, and there are many choices of wine."
有現場DJ放音樂，環境乾淨無煙味，酒不錯喝，價格一杯約４００,"There are on -site DJs to put music, the environment is clean and smoke -free, the wine is good, the price is about 400"
介紹詳細，velvet mafia的香氣很喜歡，音樂跟座位環境讓人放鬆自在。,"For details, Velvet Mafia's aroma likes it, and the environment of music and seats is relaxed."
整體環境還算不錯，喝酒也很有FU，但就桌跟桌之間，的空間不是很大，覺得小小遺憾,"The overall environment is pretty good, and drinking is also very FU, but the space is not very large between the table and the table. I feel a little regrettable."
Jeremy 很親切，提出需求會很認真解決問題 ，也會提出解決方案及確認客戶需求是否滿足，很讚的服務員,"Jeremy is very kind. When it comes to the demand, it will solve the problem very seriously."

位子之間的空間很大，感覺自在不受壓迫，音樂水準也高，服務人員熱 心也專業，非常適合週末與朋友來聽音樂小飲聊天放鬆,"The space between the seat is very large, it feels free from oppression, the level of music is also high, and the service staff is very enthusiastic and professional. It is very suitable"

Bartender 詢問我們的喜好跟心情，幫我們調酒，很不錯的體驗。,"Bartender asked our preferences and mood, helping us bartender, and a very good experience."
酒很特別，很好喝，bartender很有趣😊，很推薦哦～～ …,"The wine is very special, very delicious, Bartender is very interesting, it is recommended ~~ ..."

可能是台北最好的雞尾酒之一。喜歡老式的，我吃過的最好的之一。這裡的氣氛也非常好，寒冷悠閒。食物也很紮實！喜歡滑塊。嗯！,"It may be one of the best cocktails in Taipei.I like old -fashioned, one of the best I have ever eaten.The atmosphere here is also very good, cold and leisurely.Food is also very solid!Like slider.Um!"
招牌雞尾酒都非常美味和獨特。搭配台北特產水果的藝伎雞尾酒和格雷伯爵雞尾酒尤其美味。而且飲料非常漂亮。招牌雞尾酒是我迄今為止去過的酒吧中最獨特的，所以如果你是遊客，我絕對推薦你去那裡。我幾乎失望了，因為我覺得薯條很普通，但是芒果番茄醬真的很好吃。它酸甜可辣。主要菜單似乎都利用了台北的特色，所以我想下次旅行時我會再次光顧。工作人員也非常友好。我認為調酒師的真正價值在於巧妙地推薦消費者想要的雞尾酒，最重要的是，我喜歡他們推薦的所有雞尾酒。另外，解釋是用英語解釋的，所以一旦我知道它的味道就更好了！,"The signature cocktails are very delicious and unique.Gehic cocktails and Earl Grairi cocktails with Taipei specialty fruits are particularly delicious.And the drink is very beautiful.The signature cocktail is the most unique in the bar I have been to date, so if you are a tourist, I definitely recommend you to go there.I was almost disappointed because I think the fries are very ordinary, but the mango tomato sauce is really delicious.It is sweet and sour.The main menus seem to use the characteristics of Taipei, so I think I will patronize again next time.The staff is also very friendly.I think the real value of the bartender is to skillfully recommend the cocktails that consumers want. The most important thing is that I like all the cocktails they recommend.In addition, the explanation is explained in English, so once I know its taste is even better!"
是的，是的，是的，就這個酒吧！這是一家如此獨特的酒吧，提供美味的日本威士忌！很棒的雞尾酒，很棒的服務和友善的員工。請注意價格:),"Yes, yes, yes, this bar!This is such a unique bar, providing delicious Japanese whiskey!A great cocktail, great service and friendly employees.Please pay attention to the price :)"
很棒的雞尾酒吧位於 AMBA 酒店下面。環境非常吸引人，氣氛涼爽輕鬆。喝了酒吧的招牌雞尾酒，也嘗試了幾種經典雞尾酒。與朋友聚會的好地方。,"A great cocktail bar is located under the AMBA Hotel.The environment is very attractive, and the atmosphere is cool and easy.After drinking the bar's signature cocktail, I also tried several classic cocktails.A good place to meet with friends."
雞尾酒經過精心調製，我的「唐的小苦」非常平衡，搖勻後口感很好。  這不是一家威士忌酒吧，而是蘇格蘭威士忌和波本威士忌的好選擇，包括當地優質的奧馬爾威士忌。  不過請注意，繁忙時服務可能會很慢。,"After careful modulation of cocktails, my ""Tang's little bitterness"" was very balanced, and the taste was very good after shaking.This is not a whiskey bar, but a good choice for Scottish whiskey and Buben whiskey, including local high -quality Omar whiskeys.However, please note that the service may be slow when busy."
我們在谷歌地圖上發現了這個酒吧，這不是我們的計劃，但我們很驚訝地在中山區發現了這個隱藏的寶石。平日期間非常安靜，他們提供多種優質雞尾酒，調酒師也非常專業。喜歡裡面的良好氛圍，這是一個與朋友一起放鬆的好地方，我很想很快再回來。那天我喝的美味雞尾酒是皮斯可酸酒，喜歡它！,"We found this bar on Google Map. This was not our plan, but we were surprised to discover this hidden gem in Zhongshan District.It is very quiet during weekdays. They provide a variety of high -quality cocktails, and the bartender is also very professional.I like the good atmosphere inside. This is a good place to relax with my friends. I want to come back soon.The delicious cocktail I drank that day was Pisco acid wine, I like it!"
步行即可到達雙連捷運站。我們週末來，需要排隊。這個地方相當寬敞，有 DJ 現場演奏音樂。我們點了桃子茶（NTD300）——樣子還不錯，黑森林（NTD450）——味道一般，荷蘭東印度（NTD400）——味道也普通。服務費10%。免費爆米花。整體來說味道並沒有給人留下深刻的印象。這不是一個重複參觀的地方。順便說一句，友好的工作人員。,"You can reach the Shuanglian MRT station.We need to line up on weekends.This place is quite spacious, and there are DJs to play music on the spot.We ordered Taozi Tea (NTD300) -the look good, Black Forest (NTD450) -The taste, Dutch East India (NTD400) -the taste is also ordinary.The service fee is 10%.Free popcorn.Overall the taste is not impressed by people.This is not a place to visit repeatedly.By the way, friendly staff."
"起初，場地很棒，我立刻喜歡上了這個地方，我們有6 個人，所有的飲料都點了飲料，爆米花是直接從微波爐裡拿出來的，裝在Costco Kirkland 原裝袋裡，在要求提供一碗時，女服務員拒絕提供，並表示他們不提供餐具，然後把袋子拿走，把它剪開以便於取用，我想你可以稱之為環保；飲料都很平庸，而且很鄙視，我想我可能會在冷飲櫃裡混合更好的飲料，更不用說它的價格高於市場價格，每份450 新台幣，然後熟食拼盤直到30 分鐘後才送上來，檢查訂單後 3有時候，當我們所有人都喝完飲料後，奶酪嘗起來像苦橡膠，看起來像是放在冰箱裡吸收的奇怪味道

在向女服務員抱怨後，商店經理走過來解釋了一些值得讚賞的事情，他為我們提供了免費的鏡頭，並詳細說明了奶酪的選擇，我對這樣的補償感到滿意，但轉折點是當我意識到他們向我收取了3960 美元時當收據上寫著 3520 時，這應該是正確的，最低 600 美元 X6 的價格為 3600 美元

我給這個場地 2 顆星；服務、食物和飲料都非常糟糕

我希望工作人員認真對待這個評論並加以改進，因為這是一個很棒的場地，真是浪費","At first, the venue was great. I immediately liked this place. We had 6 people, all the drinks ordered the drink. The popcorn was taken out of the microwave directly and installed in the original bag of Costco Kirkland. When the bowl, the female waiter refused to provide it and said that they did not provide tableware, and then took the bag away to cut it for easy use. I think you can call it environmental protection; the drinks are mediocre and contempt. I might mix better drinks in the cold drink cabinet, let alone its price is higher than the market price, each of which is NT $ 450, and then the cooked packet is delivered until 30 minutes. After everyone drinks the drink, the cheese tastes like bitter rubber, and it looks like a strange taste that is absorbed in the refrigerator.

After complaining to the female waiter, the store manager came over to explain something worthy of appreciation. He provided us with free shots and explained in detail the choice of cheese. When they received 3960 US dollars to me when the receipt was written on the receipt, it should be correct, the lowest price of $ 600 X6 is $ 3600

I give 2 stars on this venue; services, food and drinks are very bad

I hope the staff will take this comment seriously and improve it, because this is a great venue, it is really a waste"
中山區隱藏的寶石💎。這是一家非常舒適的酒吧，他們的招牌雞尾酒🍹真的很美味！另外，開胃菜也不錯。 🤩 …,"Hidden gemstone in Zhongshan District.This is a very comfortable bar, their signature cocktails are really delicious!In addition, appetizers are also good.🤩 🤩 ..."
很棒的酒吧，這些是台北的新趨勢。招牌雞尾酒，英俊的調酒師，漂亮的裝飾。非常寬敞。喝一杯的好地方。,"A great bar, these are the new trend of Taipei.Signboard cocktail, handsome bartender, beautiful decoration.Very spacious.Drink a good place."
"漂亮又別緻又涼爽的地方還有不錯的雞尾酒。

不會說這是我吃過的最好的，但也不錯，但對於 TW 標準來說有點貴。

很棒的雞尾酒和服務。有點隱藏在中山的一家餐廳後面。調酒師非常友好，提供了很多不同的飲料供我們嘗試。如果你想要美味的雞尾酒，你不能錯過這個地方。在這裡度過了愉快的時光並且一定會再次訪問。,"Great cocktails and services.A bit hidden behind a restaurant in Zhongshan.The bartender is very friendly and provides a lot of different beverages for us to try.If you want delicious cocktails, you can't miss this place.I have a pleasant time here and will definitely visit again."
"和我的朋友在泥巴酒吧度過了一個美好的夜晚。
氣氛很冷，工作人員很棒。
Dylan 為我們做了 3 種不同的杜松子酒，它們的口味各不相同，味道棒極了！
菜單上的雞尾酒我們點了紫蘇酸，它很新鮮，聞起來很自然。
Wawa也是一位很棒的員工，她很有耐心而且很健談。
這是一次很棒的Mud體驗。一定會再來這裡的。","I spent a wonderful night with my friends in the mud bar.
The atmosphere is very cold and the staff is great.
Dylan made three different Du Songzi wine for us. Their tastes are different, and the taste is great!
We ordered the perilla acid on the cocktail on the menu. It is fresh and smells natural.
Wawa is also a great employee. She is very patient and talkative.
This is a great MUD experience.I will definitely come here again."
一個完全樸實無華、舒適的地方！我們的女服務生 Pei 是最好的——細心、貼心、專業。調酒師迪倫是一位魔術師。絕對會繼續回來！ 100%推薦這家少見的好酒吧！,"A completely simple and comfortable place!Our female waiter PEI is the best -careful, intimate, professional.The bartender Dylan is a magician.Will definitely continue!100%recommend this rare good bar!"
非常漂亮和休閒的酒吧。那是星期五晚上，吃過晚餐後，附近有 DJ 在那裡播放音樂。也很好喝。,"Very beautiful and casual bar.It was Friday night. After dinner, DJs played music nearby.It's also delicious."
服務極差，雞尾酒很差，其他方面氣氛都很好。評論說其中一種飲料味道是人造的，調酒師過來糾正我們，這正是它應該的味道。回合結束時要求喝水，30分鐘內沒有任何動作。再次詢問同一個調酒師時，他不情願地說「喔…好吧」。後來他們道歉說他們可以給我們 20% 的折扣，團隊負責人最後出現並說這些都不是真的，全價照樣。,"The service is very poor, the cocktails are very poor, and the atmosphere in other aspects is very good.Comments saying that one of the beverages is artificial, and the bartender comes to correct us. This is exactly what it should taste.Drinking water at the end of the round, there is no action within 30 minutes.When he asked the same bartender again, he reluctantly said, ""Oh ... well.""Later, they apologized that they could give us a 20% discount. The team leaders finally appeared and said that these were not true, and they were full of price."
"氣氛很好，音樂品味也很好（我們在 22:00 後看到了 DJ）飲料很獨特
我非常喜歡藝妓！","The atmosphere is very good, and the music taste is also very good (we saw DJ after 22:00) Drink is very unique
I like geisha very much!"
非常酷和客觀的服務，期望更好，因為他們在走私者的名單上。我的藝伎又甜又香，喜歡前幾口，但很難喝完。我可能是錯的，但我認為飲料中的鳳梨糖漿知道我沒有像我應該的那樣欣賞酒吧和飲料，所以它灼傷了我的嘴。,"Very cool and objective service, expecting better, because they are on the list of smuggles.My geisha is sweet and fragrant, I like the first few mouthfuls, but it is difficult to finish.I might be wrong, but I think the pineapple syrup in the drink knows that I don't appreciate the bar and drink as I should, so it burn my mouth."
"點一杯威士忌酸，還不錯。然而，當我點啤酒時，他們的杯子就用完了。這讓我很驚訝，因為酒吧還沒有滿員。

這是我第一次去酒吧並告訴我他們的玻璃杯用完了。

價格在該地區也相對較高。一杯雞尾酒花了400。","Order a glass of whiskey acid, pretty good.However, when I ordered beer, their cups were used up.This surprised me because the bar was not full.

This is the first time I went to the bar and told me that their glass was used up.

The price is relatively high in the region.A cup of cocktail is 400."
"美味的雞尾酒，迪倫（我去的那天晚上他是我的調酒師）在雞尾酒菜單上做得非常出色
我吃了龍井和紅毒蛇，然後有人建議我去福爾摩沙老式餐廳
他們都滿足了這位美國調酒師對台灣風味/根雞尾酒的渴望
圖為福爾摩沙老式","The delicious cocktail, Dylan (the night I went to the night he was my bartender) made very well on the cocktail menu
I ate Longjing and the red poisonous snake, and then someone suggested that I go to the old -fashioned restaurant in Forthaosha
They all satisfy this American bartender's desire for Taiwan's flavor/root cocktail

非常好的酒吧。良好的音樂和氛圍。價格合理。請注意，這是一個安靜的酒吧。,Very good bar.Good music and atmosphere.The price is reasonable.Please note that this is a quiet bar.
優雅的酒廊酒吧，美妙的音樂，非常涼爽的地方。飲料真的很好，有點貴，但對於班級來說，這是一個相當不錯的地方，可以閒逛、放鬆和與朋友聊天。 :),"Elegant bars, wonderful music, very cool place.The drink is really good and a bit expensive, but for the class, this is a very good place. You can stroll around, relax and chat with friends.:)"
"常來這裡約會。美麗的室內設計與現代家具。晚上有現場 DJ。一切都與一杯葡萄酒或雞尾酒相得益彰。

冬天的特色就是熱紅酒❤️","I often come here to date.Beautiful interior design and modern furniture.There was a scene DJ at night.Everything complements a glass of wine or cocktail.

The characteristics of winter are hot red wine ❤️"
良好的氛圍，良好的品質和美味的雞尾酒❤️🍷我喜歡這個，一定會再來！ …,"A good atmosphere, good quality and delicious cocktail ❤️🍷 I like this, I will definitely come again!Mowing"
去過這個地方好幾次了。很棒的雞尾酒吧，位於AMBA酒店下面，低調的入口在小巷裡。總體而言，服務很棒，有不錯的招牌雞尾酒和開胃菜。令人難以置信的音響系統和美妙的音樂品味。,去過這個地方好幾次了。很棒的雞尾酒吧，位於AMBA酒店下面，低調的入口在小巷裡。總體而言，服務很棒，有不錯的招牌雞尾酒和開胃菜。令人難以置信的音響系統和美妙的音樂品味。
"服務非常慢。當我們收到第一杯飲料時，我們已經很累了，想要離開。然而，他們仍然想向我們收取最低費用，並強迫我們購買飲料帶走。我幾乎可以肯定這是不合法的。

如果你的酒吧不錯，你不需要強迫人們留在那裡買飲料。但是，您對待客戶就像對待擠奶的搖錢樹。多麼悲傷啊。應該為自己感到羞恥。","The service is very slow.When we received the first drink, we were already tired and wanted to leave.However, they still want to charge us the minimum and force us to buy drinks.I am almost sure that this is illegal.

If your bar is good, you don't need to force people to stay there to buy drinks.However, you treat customers like cash cow.What a sad.Should be ashamed of yourself."
優質的服務，美味/令人興奮的飲料，還有糟糕的音響系統。有什麼不喜歡的？ :),"High -quality services, delicious/exciting drinks, and bad audio systems.What do you dislike?:)"
入口很難找到，但是很容易使用，我經常使用它。,"It is difficult to find at the entrance, but it is easy to use. I often use it."
酒吧利用有樂團在場的優勢，強迫人們至少花 600 台幣購買飲料。但服務很糟糕，我們等了太久才喝第一杯酒（一杯啤酒大約需要 45 分鐘），以至於我們已經很累了，想離開。但是，他們強迫我們買飲料帶走。令人厭惡的剝削，他們應該為自己糟糕的服務和態度感到羞恥。避免。,酒吧利用有樂團在場的優勢，強迫人們至少花 600 台幣購買飲料。但服務很糟糕，我們等了太久才喝第一杯酒（一杯啤酒大約需要 45 分鐘），以至於我們已經很累了，想離開。但是，他們強迫我們買飲料帶走。令人厭惡的剝削，他們應該為自己糟糕的服務和態度感到羞恥。避免。
好經理很熱情，熱情好客，友善！老外的晚安酒吧！,"Good manager is very enthusiastic, enthusiastic, good, friendly!Good night bar for foreigners!"
庫存充足。  良好的服務和非常敬業的調酒師。  到處都是……很棒的體驗。,Enough inventory.Good service and very dedicated bartender.Everywhere ... a great experience.
我去過的最好的酒吧。四年前參加瑪麗亞之旅時來過，住在附近的麗晶飯店。喝了我有幸喝過的最好的老式酒。他們的音頻設置完美無缺。,The best bar I have been to.I came together four years ago when I participated in the Maria journey and lived in a nearby Licheng Hotel.I drank the best old -fashioned wine I have drank.Their audio settings are perfect.
酒吧的氣氛很好。音樂很好聽。雞尾酒味道很好，沒有太多的裝飾。雞尾酒的價格在400新台幣左右。推薦《龍井》。如果你喜歡茶的香氣，點這款你不會後悔的。,"The atmosphere of the bar is very good.The music is nice.The cocktail tastes very good, without much decoration.The price of cocktails is about S $ 400.Recommend ""Longjing"".If you like the aroma of tea, you will not regret it."
這是喝幾杯飲料的好地方，調酒師很友善，威士忌和馬丁尼很棒，沙發和座位也很舒適。,"This is a good place to drink a few drinks. The bartender is very friendly, whiskey and Martini are great, and the sofas and seats are very comfortable."
MUD 一直被評為台北十大雞尾酒酒吧，是一次很棒的體驗。經典的地下酒吧，雞尾酒經過精心調製，價格也很合理。我吃過的最好的老式的之一，採用頂級的原料。調酒師細心、友善且專業。我來台北出差，這裡的氛圍和態度讓我很容易放鬆和消磨時間。,"MUD has been rated as the top ten cocktail bars in Taipei, which is a great experience.Classic underground bar, cocktails have been carefully prepared, and the price is reasonable.One of the best old styles I have ever eaten is top -level raw materials.The bartender is careful, friendly and professional.I came to Taipei for a business trip. The atmosphere and attitude here made me easily relax and eliminate time."
汽車氛圍非常輕鬆，音樂很棒！,The atmosphere of the car is very easy and the music is great!
工作人員非常粗魯，沒有尊重或任何熱情，甚至根本沒有簡單的方式。充滿了自己,"The staff is very rude, no respect or any enthusiasm, or even no simple way.Full of yourself"
地點很好，有地下酒吧的氛圍。很棒的客戶服務和氛圍。會再來的。,"The location is very good, there is an underground bar atmosphere.Great customer service and atmosphere.Will come again."
"非常棒的一家酒吧，無論是氛圍環境，服務生專業態度，以及酒的品質都很棒。
服務生以及bartender都十分專業而且願意為我們解釋各種酒的區別，最後呈現的調酒也都很好喝，非酒精飲料也非常棒，特調的蘇打水第一口下去真的超級幸福。
非常值得推薦的店
調酒一杯400NT，絕對值得。","A great bar, whether it is an atmosphere environment, a professional attitude of the waiter, and the quality of the wine.
The waiters and Bartender are very professional and are willing to explain the differences in various wines for us. The final bartending is also delicious. Non -alcoholic beverages are also very good. The first baking soda is really super happy.
Very worth recommending shop
A cup of 400NT is definitely worth it."
"頂級專業雞尾酒@台北
如果你喜歡雞尾酒你應該來這裡","Top professional cocktail@顶 顶
If you like cocktail, you should come here"
"酒吧經理德里克總是很熱情而且心情很好。調酒師小麥服務也很好。兩人都對不同種類的酒類有豐富的知識，Derrick 尤其是威士忌的知識

在我看來，老式飲料的最佳轉折之一（福爾摩沙老式）","Bar manager Derek is always very enthusiastic and good.The bartender wheat service is also very good.Both have rich knowledge about different types of alcohol, Derrick, especially whiskey, knowledge

In my opinion, one of the best turns for old -fashioned beverages (Formosha Lao)"
坐在吧台上看著 Ryan 調配那些富有創意和精美的飲料真是純粹的藝術！感謝您讓這個夜晚變得特別！,Sitting on the bar and watching Ryan mixing those creative and exquisite drinks is really pure art!Thank you for making this night special!
"中山區的地點，鬧區一流酒吧的價位，只是非常可惜這個酒吧從酒到服務是三流酒吧的水準。調酒嘛，形容的味道跟實際上做出來的味道認知有落差也是常有的事，只要願意跟顧客溝通，不就是一個很好的交流嗎？偏偏staff的氣焰高漲，一定要先堅持這個酒就是這樣，才肯再做調整。後來因為服務上的疏忽，有位staff表示可以整桌的酒給一點折扣以表心意。 想不到這個staff前腳剛走一位自稱是領班的人就來了說打折都不算數。 如此勇敢的舉止看的我們全桌的人是瞠目結舌，完全不敢相信自己的耳朵。 一陣拍手鼓掌叫好之後，趕緊付錢走人。
領班啊領班，首先，自己的staff 訓練要做好啊，公司的製度如何，什麼可以做什麼不能做，要確定大家都會了再面對客戶吧。 說實話，打不打折，差的都是區區5，600 塊的事情，但是對於接收到這樣待遇的的顧客來說，就是會不會再來光顧，還有會不會上來打個review的差異了。 恭喜你們生意很好，不差我們幾個顧客，但是奉勸領班，這種事還是少做吧，團隊也是你自己帶的，600 塊就算自己吃下來，也不要再客戶面前丟人現眼了。","In the location of Zhongshan District, the price of the first -class bars in the downtown area is a pity that this bar from wine to service is the level of the third campaign.Well, the taste described is also a common thing to have gaps with the facts actually made. As long as you are willing to communicate with customers, isn't it a good communication?The breath of STAFF is rising, so you must insist that this wine is like this, so you are willing to make adjustments.Later, because of the negligence in the service, a Staff said that the entire table could give a little discount to express your mind.I didn't expect that the front foot of this STAFF just walked a person who claimed to be a foreman and said that the discount was not counted.The people who looked at us with such brave manners were dazzling, and they couldn't believe their ears at all.After a while of applauding, he quickly paid for.
The foreman and foreman, first of all, your staff training must be done well. What is the company's system and what can be done and cannot be done. You must be sure that everyone will meet customers.To be honest, if you do n’t discount, the difference is 5,600 yuan, but for customers who receive such treatment, will it come to patronize? EssenceCongratulations to your business, not bad for our customers, but advise the foreman, do this kind of thing less, the team is also brought by you. Even if you eat it yourself, do n’t be shameful in front of the customer."
在非常放鬆的節奏環境中享用美味的飲品。禁煙 - 耶！我來自西雅圖，這裡的飲料非常高端而且昂貴，就像在我的家鄉一樣。如果您想在台灣體驗令人驚嘆的手工調製雞尾酒，這裡就是您的地方，但要知道您離開這裡的費用並不便宜。,"Enjoy delicious drinks in a very relaxed rhythm environment.Smoking -Yeah!I am from Seattle. The drinks here are very high -end and expensive, just like in my hometown.If you want to experience the amazing handmade cocktail in Taiwan, this is your place, but you know that your cost is not cheap."
氣氛很好，但服務生可以更主動！,氣氛很好，但服務生可以更主動！
小型地下酒吧，提供一長串雞尾酒！這個休息室有 DJ，有一些有趣的裝飾，以動物和動物頭為特色，整體充滿了時髦的氛圍。老實說，我認為座位可以安排得更好。人們被拒之門外，因為顧客往往會在這些舒適（又大又佔空間）的椅子上待很長時間，但沒有人會因為價格而點超過 1 杯的飲料。服務也很慢。,小型地下酒吧，提供一長串雞尾酒！這個休息室有 DJ，有一些有趣的裝飾，以動物和動物頭為特色，整體充滿了時髦的氛圍。老實說，我認為座位可以安排得更好。人們被拒之門外，因為顧客往往會在這些舒適（又大又佔空間）的椅子上待很長時間，但沒有人會因為價格而點超過 1 杯的飲料。服務也很慢。
很棒的飲料！老實說，這是我在亞洲去過的所有地方喝過的最好的雞尾酒。調酒師非常友好，是調製飲料的工匠。強烈推薦您來參觀。,"A great drink!Honestly, this is the best cocktail I have drank everything in Asia.The bartender is very friendly and is a craftsman to prepare drinks.It is strongly recommended that you come to visit."
涼爽的氛圍和複雜的雞尾酒。,The cool atmosphere and complex cocktail.
小巷子裡的一家低調的酒吧。非常寒冷和放鬆。工作人員失踪了，所以我們不得不等一會兒，但是一位調酒師看到我們在等待時向我們走來。雞尾酒非常好，工作人員很友好:)謝謝,小巷子裡的一家低調的酒吧。非常寒冷和放鬆。工作人員失踪了，所以我們不得不等一會兒，但是一位調酒師看到我們在等待時向我們走來。雞尾酒非常好，工作人員很友好:)謝謝
不錯的體驗！雞尾酒很不錯，但你可能需要等一會兒。,"Good experience!Cocktails are very good, but you may need to wait for a while."
"來這裡好幾次了，這是有史以來最糟糕的經歷，我們等了40 分鐘才喝第一杯，又等了40 分鐘才喝第二杯，他們看起來確實很忙，所以我想我們可以忍受。但後來又來了幾個朋友，那時人還不是很多，我們又點了六杯飲料，其中五杯很快就來了，但最後一杯還沒喝完就還沒來，一直告訴我們他們正在成功。

給兩顆星，飲料還不錯，但我不會再來了，那10%的服務費絕對不值得。","來這裡好幾次了，這是有史以來最糟糕的經歷，我們等了40 分鐘才喝第一杯，又等了40 分鐘才喝第二杯，他們看起來確實很忙，所以我想我們可以忍受。但後來又來了幾個朋友，那時人還不是很多，我們又點了六杯飲料，其中五杯很快就來了，但最後一杯還沒喝完就還沒來，一直告訴我們他們正在成功。

給兩顆星，飲料還不錯，但我不會再來了，那10%的服務費絕對不值得。"
"可能是我經歷過的最糟糕的服務/調酒師。如果我可以給負面評價，我會的。 *在看這篇評論之前，請記住，他們收取10％的服務費，飲料平均約為400新台幣。當時是晚上 11 點左右，店裡已經滿了，但並不擁擠或繁忙*

我的朋友比我和其他朋友早 20 分鐘到達，並點了一杯飲料。當我們一行人都到齊後，飲料終於來了。

酒吧裡有空間，但沒有足夠的凳子。我們等了幾分鐘才有人向我們打招呼，但 3 個調酒師中有 2 個正在調製飲料，其中 1 個只是在烘乾杯子。所以我們必須自己準備凳子。然後我們要了菜單 - 他們給我們指了一個方向並告訴我們“就在那裡”。我們繼續獲取自己的菜單。

我們一行的其他人和女調酒師一起點了菜。 5 分鐘內就送來了 1 杯飲料。然後調酒師開始清洗搖酒器（酒吧裡已經有很多搖酒器了，所以沒有必要），擦拭一些杯子，甚至吃了點零食，而不是開始為我們調製飲料。

又過了 10-15 分鐘，調酒師繼續做調酒以外的任務。我不得不向另一位調酒師詢問我們的飲料，他繼續誤導我們，告訴我們地板上有碎玻璃，他們需要先清理（有碎玻璃，但在我們點飲料後就碎了）。

女調酒師試圖向我們解釋，第一杯飲料很快就來了，因為它很容易製作（作為體驗和服務的一部分，這是一個相當荒謬的藉口，那就是您在收到飲料的同時並在品嚐飲料的同時嘗試它們）你的朋友）。

如果調酒師支持並為其他顧客製作飲料並減慢服務速度，我完全可以接受，但我不能接受的是糟糕的服務和糟糕的態度。

我不會推薦任何想要度過美好夜晚或美好體驗的人來這個酒吧。

更新：我的朋友 20 分鐘前又點了一杯飲料，但同樣沒有來。這家酒吧完全是個笑話。","It may be the worst service/bartender I have ever experienced.If I can give negative evaluations, I will.*Before reading this comment, please remember that they charge a 10 % service fee with an average of about NT $ 400.It was around 11 o'clock in the evening, and the store was full, but it was not crowded or busy*

My friend arrived 20 minutes earlier than me and I and I ordered a drink.When we all arrived in Qi, the drink finally came.

There is space in the bar, but there is no enough stool.We waited for a few minutes to say hello to us, but two of the three alcoholics were being prepared, one of them was just dried the cup.So we must prepare a stool ourselves.Then we asked the menu -they pointed us in a direction and told us ""there"".We continue to get our menu.

Others in our party ordered with female tunnels.A cup of drink was delivered in 5 minutes.Then the bartender began to clean the wine device (there are already a lot of wine shakes in the bar, so it is not necessary), wipe some cups, and even ate some snacks, instead of starting to prepare drinks for us.

After another 10-15 minutes, the bartender continued to do tasks other than bartender.I had to ask another soberist to ask our drink. He continued to mislead us and tell us that there are broken glass on the floor. They need to clean it first (with broken glass, but we crushed it after we order the drink).

The feminine winemaker tried to explain to us that the first cup of beverages came quickly because it was easy to make (as part of the experience and service, this is a very ridiculous excuse, that is, when you receive the drink, you and the drink Try them while tasting drinks) your friends).

If the bartender supports and makes drinks for other customers and slows down the service speed, I can accept it, but what I can't accept is the bad service and bad attitude.

I will not recommend anyone who wants to spend a good night or a good experience to come to this bar.

Update: My friend ordered another drink 20 minutes ago, but did not come.This bar is a joke at all."
這是一個特別的地方，您可以在自己的餐桌上享用美酒並放鬆身心。根本不是一個潛水酒吧，沒有那種站在那裡的氛圍，但非常寒冷。服務很好，DJ 也很準時。,這是一個特別的地方，您可以在自己的餐桌上享用美酒並放鬆身心。根本不是一個潛水酒吧，沒有那種站在那裡的氛圍，但非常寒冷。服務很好，DJ 也很準時。

好：裝飾精美。無菸。精選的雞尾酒和啤酒。缺點：他們花了 20 分鐘才給我啤酒，除了爆米花之外他們沒有任何食物。,好：裝飾精美。無菸。精選的雞尾酒和啤酒。缺點：他們花了 20 分鐘才給我啤酒，除了爆米花之外他們沒有任何食物。
去電訂位，說今天有bar surfing客座要門票800，確認是否依bar surfing捲入場，應答可以，到場接待員態度強硬：沒辦法，那是他講錯，就是沒辦法。語氣非常不好👎是你們溝通問題，在兇什麼？我還特別約朋友跑一趟，非常不悅的體驗。 …,去電訂位，說今天有bar surfing客座要門票800，確認是否依bar surfing捲入場，應答可以，到場接待員態度強硬：沒辦法，那是他講錯，就是沒辦法。語氣非常不好👎是你們溝通問題，在兇什麼？我還特別約朋友跑一趟，非常不悅的體驗。 …
"我在台北去過的最好的酒吧之一。
很棒的氛圍，不錯的音樂和演講者。雞尾酒很好喝。
肯定會再次訪問。","One of the best bars I have been to Taipei.
A great atmosphere, good music and speaker.Cocktails are delicious.
Will definitely visit again."
"氣氛很好，雞尾酒很獨特。
他們不提供食物。  如果您喜歡美國菜，我會推薦樓上的餐廳","The atmosphere is very good, and the cocktails are unique.
They do not provide food.If you like American food, I will recommend the restaurant upstairs"
休閒酒吧提供多種雞尾酒。非常適合舉辦輕鬆的活動，因為他們允許出租空間舉辦活動，而優秀的調酒師確實在飲料上投入了很多精力。,"Casual bar offers a variety of cocktails.Very suitable for easy activities, because they allow the rental space to organize activities, and excellent bartenders do have a lot of energy on drinks."
特調非常有特色，利用肉桂棒以及通寧水為基底，加上紅茶與酒精，前兩者的香味將酒精刺鼻味壓製到最低，紅茶則帶出基酒的香味，可別小看他們的特調，沒酒味但確實含有酒精呢,"The special adjustment is very distinctive. The use of cinnamon sticks and Tongning water as the base, plus black tea and alcohol. The special tone, no wine taste but does contain alcohol"
放鬆的好地方。該地區相當安全。氣氛很好。但是，到了晚上 10 點，白葡萄酒就用完了。,"Relaxed place.The region is quite safe.The atmosphere is very good.However, at 10 pm, white wine was used up."
非常舒適漂亮的酒吧，可以放鬆身心，提供許多美味的雞尾酒,"Very comfortable and beautiful bar, you can relax your body and mind, provide many delicious cocktails"

好雞尾酒。菜單種類繁多，工作人員訓練有素，可以解釋口味和不同的食材。,"Good cocktail.There are many types of menu, and the staff is well -trained to explain the taste and different ingredients."
享用清涼雞尾酒的好地方。低調、舒適的酒吧，他們的菜單上有很多很棒的雞尾酒，原料獨特。,"Enjoy a good place for cool cocktails.Low -key, comfortable bar, their menu has a lot of great cocktails, unique raw materials."
真的很好的氛圍和古色古香的裝飾。調酒師非常樂於助人，並建議我們可能喜歡哪些飲料,"Really good atmosphere and antique decoration.The bartender is very willing to help others, and it is suggested which drinks we may like"
超好,Superb
和朋友一起去的。糟糕的服務。女服務生很傲慢。要求喝水，但被告知沒有水，最後不情願地給了兩杯水，但我們有三個人。杜爾！沒有第二次訪問！,和朋友一起去的。糟糕的服務。女服務生很傲慢。要求喝水，但被告知沒有水，最後不情願地給了兩杯水，但我們有三個人。杜爾！沒有第二次訪問！

"等了很久才找到一張桌子，儘管酒吧還沒有滿員，因為工作人員在調酒和服務的同時。

只好走到櫃檯讓他們接受訂單；更糟的是，態度是居高臨下的。

我們沒有訂購就離開了，並在附近找到了一個更好的地方。","After waiting for a long time, I found a table, although the bar was not full, because the staff was alcohol and service.

I had to go to the counter for them to accept the order; worse, the attitude was high.

We left without ordering and found a better place nearby."
可以看出調酒師工作過度了- 通常我不介意等待，但令我困擾的是調酒師使用相同的雞尾酒攪拌器來混合飲料，然後將其放入嘴中品嚐......沒有清洗它在雞尾酒之間。我坐在吧台邊。總的！,可以看出調酒師工作過度了- 通常我不介意等待，但令我困擾的是調酒師使用相同的雞尾酒攪拌器來混合飲料，然後將其放入嘴中品嚐......沒有清洗它在雞尾酒之間。我坐在吧台邊。總的！
