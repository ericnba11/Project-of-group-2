點了超級多樣，很適合朋友聚餐的場合，餐點也都很好吃，很幸運剛好坐在吧台區，可以近距離看師傅料理的過程，真的超級喜歡看著做料理的感覺。,"The order is super diverse. It is very suitable for friends to dinner. The meals are also delicious.

"地點在士林捷運出來就到了，建議要做預約，因為位置不算多，而且偏擁擠，不喜歡太吵太擠的建議避開

Handmade tempura: a bit less and hard, the CP value is not high
Nagoya flavor fried chicken wings: drizzle lemon, the taste is great!
Garlic fried water lotus: The taste is light, which can be used to neutralize the taste and increase the amount of vegetables.
Baked Jingyu: Poil oil, drizzle lemon juice and salt delicious
Little Black Pig in Taiwan: If you dare not eat fat, please skip. Many green onions can neutralize oil and taste light.

"隨機的開google map踩點，
一出士林站就看到很有fu的蔦燒居酒屋。

踏進去迎面而來的是小小的壽司板前，
轉角的迷你屋台掛滿了一夜干，
瞬間期望值拉很高！

菜單選擇超級多，當天還有季節限定的菜色，
我們憑直覺點了：
清酒蒸蛤蜊、串燒 (雞心雞胗、鹽烤雞腿、月見雞肉丸子、柚子雞里肌、蔥鹽香菇)、限定的星鰻捲壽司、胡麻菠菜捲、牛舌雞白湯、清炒水蓮

喔，光是那碗清酒蒸蛤蜊上桌，
嚇得我們下巴都掉了，
那個蛤蜊巨大到不科學啊啊啊啊！
清酒的酒精揮發，留下了純米香，
入口除了鮮味還有雅緻的芬芳，
原來師傅加了柚子鹽調味🤤

月見雞肉丸子：
裡面滿滿的軟骨，喜歡口感派的會咬的很開心，丸子本身也很啾吸，醬汁的風情則是清爽派，配上生蛋黃剛剛好的舒服，不會太濃郁。

星鰻捲壽司：其實是我們被隔壁桌剛端上的壽司給吸住了目光，就點了一份試試也當作主食。
一口大小的捲壽司，用料很澎湃啊！
中間捲了玉子燒、蘆筍跟白蝦，
上面覆蓋著照燒風味的星鰻跟鮭魚卵，
放入口中是口感與風味都有豐富的層次，
著實很驚艷！

每道菜都非常夠味好吃，
整體調味都是很重視食材原汁原味，
沒有過重的調整，
是清爽中帶有一些畫龍點睛的味道。

最後上場的是牛舌雞白湯，
當我們從湯裡面撈出整塊超厚切牛舌，
直接是原地驚呼不已😱
而且不是一塊而是兩塊！
生平第一次會想嫌牛舌太厚😂
好功夫都在這碗湯裡了，
牛舌厚歸厚，但非常的軟嫩，
沒有舌頭一頂就化開那麼誇張，
但也八九不離十，
搭配濃郁到可以撈出整片油膜的雞白湯，
瞬間暖了胃也暖了心❤️

店長與店員也很親切友善，
雖然因為下個時段有訂位所以時間比較短，
依然是心滿意足的一餐！

以士林區為據點的居酒屋連鎖，
很適合放鬆吃飯喝酒的好地方，
當天點的菜完全不雷，
而且超乎期待😊
值得好好寫篇食記來致敬！

酒水選擇也夠多，
強烈建議先訂位！
認真的餐廳值得推薦！","Randomly open Google Map to step on the point,

Sake steamed clams, skewers (chicken heart chicken, salt grilled chicken legs, Yueshi chicken balls, grapefruit chicken muscles, onion and salt mushrooms), limited star eel sushi, flax spinach rolls, beef tongue chicken white soup, stir -fried lotus lotus lotus lotus lotus, stir -fried water lotus lotus lotus lotus

Oh, the bowl of sake and steamed clams on the table alone,
I scared our chin and dropped,
That clam is so huge unscientific!
The alcohol of sake was volatile, leaving pure rice incense,
In addition to the umami taste, the entrance also has elegant fragrance,
It turns out that the master added grapefruit salt to season

Moon see chicken balls:
The cartilage is full of cartilage. Those who like the taste can be bitten very happy. The balls itself is very sucking. The style of the sauce is refreshing. It is just comfortable with the egg yolk, which will not be too strong.

Star eel roll sushi: In fact, the sushi we was just on the table was attracted to the eyes.
The size of the size of the size is surging!
In the middle, Yuzi roasted, asparagus and white shrimp,
Star eel and salmon eggs covered with the flavor of the roast,
In the mouth, there is a rich level of taste and flavor,
It's really amazing!

Every dish is very delicious enough,
The overall seasoning focuses on the original flavor of the ingredients,
No overweight adjustment,
It is refreshing with some finishing touch.

Finally, the beef tongue chicken white soup,
When we remove the whole piece of ultra -thick beef tongue from the soup,
I am exclaimed directly 惊 惊 惊 惊 惊
And it is not one but two!
For the first time in my life, I think that the cow's tongue is too thick 😂
Good efforts are all in this bowl of soup,
The beef tongue is thick and thick, but it is very soft and tender,
It is so exaggerated without the tongue,
But it is also not left to ten,
It is paired with a strong chicken white soup that can remove the entire oil film,
Instantly warming the stomach and warming the heart ❤️

The manager and the clerk are also very kind and friendly,
Although it is relatively short because there are reservations in the next period, the time is relatively short.
Still a satisfied meal!

"店裡冷氣很冷，吃之前很冷，吃的時候不冷，吃完又冷了…座位空間雖然不大，但店家並不會每個座位坐滿，所以並不會感到擁擠。

一開始會招待小菜毛豆一份。今天點了日式炒烏龍、味噌日本茄子、起司蘑菇、獨家蔦球、味噌小黑豬肉、水蜜桃沙瓦。整體來說餐點的料理感覺比較粗曠，調味有特色。

小菜毛豆就中規中矩感覺很新鮮（？）味噌小黑豬肉是像韓式烤肉的五花豬肉，肥肉的部分吃起來不會感覺油膩，但是瘦肉的部分就會比較需要齒力，搭配味噌醬可以提升整體的味道。

起司蘑菇的部分，蘑菇非常鮮嫩多汁，除了起司調味和香料之外沒有其他調味。算滿有原味的，也很清爽。

日式炒烏龍麵上來幾乎是碗公的份量，兩個人吃完幾乎不太需要再點什麼。柴魚很香，但整體口味偏鹹跟重，雞肉給得很隨意，也很多，菜也切得很隨意，洋蔥已煮到焦糖化，味道融合得很好，只是料的大小都切得很隨意。本身無好壞，就是看店家希望料理呈現什麼樣的風格。

味噌日本茄子，其實就是田樂燒，味噌和豬肉的是一樣的，但感覺比較不鹹（還是我習慣了？）茄子不是台灣常看到的細長茄子，是矮肥短的，吃起來纖維很綿密。但用湯匙其實有點難挖，如果能幫忙切得明確一點會比較方便吃。皮吃起來有點焦苦的味道，還有點硬（？）韌（？）推薦吃肉就好。

水蜜桃沙瓦酒味明顯，但不帶苦味，可喝到水蜜桃果渣感，挺不錯。

獨家蔦球是用麵粉跟牛奶製成的炸球，吃起來軟Q而不油，沾煉乳花生粉有著不輸麻糬的適合感。","The air -conditioning in the store is very cold, it is cold before eating, it is not cold when you eat, and it is cold after eating ... Although the seat space is not large, the store will not sit up every seat, so it will not feel crowded.

At the beginning, it will entertain the edama.Today I ordered Japanese -style oolong, miso Japanese eggplant, cheese mushrooms, exclusive balls, miso small black pork, and peach sandwood.On the whole, the dishes of meals are relatively rough and have distinctive flavor.

Small rosin feels very fresh (?) Miso small black pork is like Korean barbecue pork pork. The fat part will not feel greasy, but the lean meat will need toothpower, with miso sauce Can enhance the overall taste.

For the cheese mushroom part, mushrooms are very tender and juicy, and there are no other flavor except cheese flavoring and spices.It is full of originality and refreshing.

The Japanese -style fried oolong noodles are almost the weight of the bowl, and they almost need to order anything after eating.The firewood is very fragrant, but the overall taste is salty and heavy. The chicken is very casual and many. The vegetables are also very casual. The onion has been cooked to caramel. random.There is no good or bad, just to see what style of the store wants to show.

Miso Japanese eggplant is actually Tian Lebing. The miso and pork are the same, but it feels less salty (or I am used to it?) Eggplant is not a slender eggplant that often sees in Taiwan. Very dense.But using a spoon is actually a bit difficult to dig. It would be more convenient to eat it if it can be cut clearly.The skin tastes a bit bitter, and it is a bit hard (?) Toughness (?) It is recommended to eat meat.

The taste of peach sandwaf is obvious, but it does not have the bitterness. It can drink the peach fruit residue, which is pretty good.

The exclusive ball is made of fried balls made of flour and milk. It tastes soft Q instead of oily. Dipping milk peanut powder has a suitable sense of not losing hemp.",False

最近迷上串燒，接連探訪了幾家日式串燒店，但可惜這家不符合我的口味，雞肉跟豬肉都切的很大塊，不是很適合鹽烤，很膩，但可能很適合愛大口吃肉的朋友。 服務很好，會主動提醒客戶不要點過多，看到客戶沒吃完也會主動詢問是否打包，或是否不合口味。 但出菜速度就控制的不好，串燒就是剛烤好才好吃，一下子全上桌，感覺很緊迫，讓人無法放鬆。 一盤兩支，對單獨用餐的人就不太友善了，無法有更多選擇。 在士林捷運站旁，交通便利。,"Recently, I was obsessed with skewers and visited several Japanese -style skewers in succession, but unfortunately this one is not in line with my taste. Both chickens and pork are very large. Friends who eat meat with big mouth.The service is very good, and the customer will actively remind customers that they do not want to order too much, and they will take the initiative to ask if the customer is not eaten if it is packed, or whether it does not taste.However, the speed of dishes is not controlled well.

本來是一直有再來的店，大概一兩個月會跟朋友在這裡小聚一下。一開始都覺得品質不錯，最近開始覺得有點問題。今天剛去，首先就是上菜速度。因爲定位只有兩小時，但我們有些東西在第一次點餐後一個小時又十分左右，還是沒上（為此有跟服務員確認還有什麼東西沒上）。後來因為真的蠻餓的，又點了第二次餐，時間大概就是剩下五十分鐘左右。最後有兩盤炸的剩下十分才上來，然後上來後跟我們說時間要到了⋯如果是一般賣吃的的餐廳⋯這樣其實也有點趕，但也不致於來不及。但這裡是居酒屋，我們開了一瓶，又有點至少三四杯的單杯，有時候會因為有沒有下酒菜影響喝的速度。像今天我們最後就喝的超趕，然後結帳又發現有沒出餐的跟我們算錢（這應該第三次了，跟店家反應後店家有退款），但綜合來說實在是覺得⋯很多事情感受上都不是很好，之後回訪的意願會降低很多。,"It was a shop that had been here, and I would get together with my friends here for about a month or two.At first I felt that the quality was good, and I felt a bit problematic recently.As soon as I just went today, the first is the speed of serving.Because the positioning is only two hours, but some of our things are about an hour after the first order, and we still have not been on (for this reason, there is confirmation with the waiter, what else is not available).Later, because I was really hungry, I ordered the second meal, and the time was about 50 minutes left.In the end, there were two frying left that came up very much, and then I told us that the time is coming. If it is a restaurant that is generally sold, it is actually a bit rushing, but it is not too late.But this is the izakaya. We opened a bottle and a single cup of at least three or four cups. Sometimes, it would be because there was any wine and vegetables affecting the speed of drinking.Like we finally drink, we finally drink, and then find out if there is any money to calculate the money with us (this should be the third time.

"覺得很普通～整體口味偏清淡，google地圖上明明看到有人給低分評價，但找不到評論可以參考

我吃的菜色不多，因為一個人用餐，只吃了三道菜，沒有點到大家推薦的明太子烏龍

極上牛舌：非常普通的口感，比較有嚼勁，不是入口即化型的，調味沒什麼印象，洋蔥比較搶戲，我後面點的鮭魚飯團都比牛舌有味道

起司蘑菇：其實我是看朋友推薦這裡有烤蘑菇才來…他五月來訪，蘑菇有四朵，我9/1來就變成三朵，心裡實在有落差xdd ，但憑良心說蘑菇咬下去沒有那麼香，就只有加起司，調味非常簡單

鮭魚烤飯糰：大概是這餐中唯一一個口味比較有層次的菜色哈哈哈，還不錯吃

雖然我才吃三道菜，但沒有讓我覺得印象深刻的美味記憶，不過沒有服務費這點還不錯，希望之後不要漲價","I feel very ordinary ~ The overall taste is light, and the Google map obviously sees someone to give a low score, but you can not find a comment. For reference, you can refer to it.

I don't eat much dishes, because a person eats, only three dishes, and I don't order the Ming Prince Oolong recommended by everyone

Extremely beef tongue: Very ordinary taste, relatively chewy, not at the entrance, there is no impression of the seasoning, the onion is more grabbing, the salmon rice balls at the back of me are more flavored than the beef tongue.

Cheese Mushroom: Actually, I read a friend to recommend that there are roast mushrooms here ... He visited in May, there were four mushrooms, and I came into three flowers in 9/1. There was a gap in my heart. It's not so fragrant to go down, just add the lift, the seasoning is very simple
