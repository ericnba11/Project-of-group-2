"非常特別的一間店，只能說如果你沒吃過特別的店，來吃看看就知道了。特別是愛喝葡萄酒的朋友，你必須來看看，這裡是葡萄酒的天堂。吃得更是不用多說，絕對是料好實在、美味佳餚送上。

P.S 無酒精料理也很ok","A very special store, you can only say that if you haven't eaten a special store, you will know if you have eaten it.Especially friends who love to drink wine, you must take a look, this is the paradise of wine.Needless to say, it is absolutely good and delicious.

Eating a meal has also increased a lot of knowledge. You can take a closer look at the logo signboard, see if you know what it is 😎

餐搭酒令人印象深刻，紅白酒的選酒都很有水準。伺酒師對酒的知識很豐富。空間也讓人非常舒服。,"The meal and wine are impressive, and the selection of red and white wine is very standard.The alcoholic knowledge of wine is rich.The space is also very comfortable.",False,0.21,0.0,0.79,0.7841
"吃得很開心，是除了享受美食之外，還能品嚐不同類型的酒，感受酒跟食物迸發不同感受的地方。

食材都很新鮮，每一道的醬汁又可以結合麵包創造出新風味，真的是很有趣的飲食體驗。

我們也在店家的推薦下，選了紅白酒搭配料理，過程很輕鬆舒服，也獲得很多關於酒的故事知識。雖然從其他評論看到有些人不習慣這種感覺，但從我自己感受、以及對同時間其他桌客人的觀察，店家還是留給客人很大空間，尊重客人的選擇。即使喝不了那麼多酒，也都不會勉強。

就算是在最後的結帳環節，要給多少服務費（小費）也都像是在國外一樣自在，客人可以自行決定。

聽說一段時間就會更換不同的酒單、菜單，如果有機會，過段時間應該會再回來體驗不同的菜色。","I am very happy to eat. In addition to enjoying the food, I can also taste different types of wine and feel different feelings and food.

The ingredients are very fresh. Each sauce can create a new flavor in combination with bread. It is really a very interesting diet experience.

Under the recommendation of the store, we chose red and white wine with dishes. The process was very easy and comfortable, and we also gained a lot of knowledge about wine.Although some people are not used to this feeling from other comments, from my own feelings and observation of other table guests at the same time, the store still leaves a lot of room for guests to respect the choice of guests.Even if you can't drink so much wine, you will not be reluctant.

Even in the final checkout session, how much service fees (tips) are to be given as comfortable as abroad, and guests can decide themselves.

I heard that different wine lists and menus will be replaced for a while. If you have a chance, you should come back to experience different dishes after a while.",False,0.172,0.0,0.828,0.9867

今天最喜歡蘑菇雞心❤️

"我們聽完服務員A的介紹後，點餐完畢服務員B馬上又前來推銷單點，但我們本來點的品項就不少了，詢問這樣加點真的不會太多吃不完嗎？服務員B打包票說吃得完。
最後事實證明就是點太多了，整個吃太飽，但也只得到一句「喔不好意思我沒預想到」。
要這樣推銷還不如好好在菜單上出一個套餐…而不是一直用口頭補述的方式，讓客人一愣一愣的點餐。
然後也不能外帶，當然吃不完的餐點為了不浪費食物也是硬著頭皮吃完。

明明是主打注重隱私，雙人來吃飯通常就是約會這應該不難猜吧..
一直上來問好不好吃、合不合胃口，對餐點的解說也聽起來像在解釋為什麼，而不是自信的介紹怎麼做，不是很懂這個操作到底想怎樣。不知道是不是因為當時只有我們一組客人，所以才有這個奇怪的體驗。

對食物的感想有好有壞，美言的部分可以參考其他人的評論。
但服務員拙劣的推銷（服務員也是一直強調喝到他們的酒有多賺）讓這頓晚餐畫下大大的遺憾。

一頓飯吃下來四千多元，這樣的價錢買到這樣的體驗，同樣的預算我肯定會選其他店。","After listening to the introduction of the waiter A, the waiter B came to sell the single point again after ordering, but there were a lot of items we originally ordered. Will it really not be too much to eat like this?The waiter B packed the ticket and said it was finished.
In the end, it is proved that too much is too much. The whole food is too full, but I only got a sentence, ""Oh, I don't think of it.""
To sell this way, it is better to make a package on the menu ... instead of always using verbal replenishment to let the guests order for a while.
Then you can't take it. Of course, the endless meal is eaten with a hard scalp in order not to waste food.

Obviously it focuses on privacy, and when two people come to eat, it is usually a date. It should not be difficult to guess ..
I have always come up and ask if it is delicious or not. The explanation of the meal also sounds like explaining why, not how to do the self -confidence introduction, and I don't know what this operation wants.I don't know if it was because there was only a group of guests at the time, so there was this strange experience.

There are good and bad feelings for food. The beautiful parts can refer to other people's comments.
But the waiter's poor marketing (the waiter also emphasized how much money to drink) to make this dinner great regret.

Eat more than 4,000 yuan for a meal. When you buy such an experience, I will definitely choose other stores in the same budget.",False,0.14,0.051,0.809,0.9844

▫️ 手作綜合麵包  $330
總共有三種麵包！蠻推薦點的因為很多菜都可以沾～裸麥麵包最有嚼勁，麵團有加入蜂蜜但滋味比較一般；墨魚麵包超酷，單吃真的有股魚味～沾蒜辣蝦醬汁更讚！布里歐有奶油香氣，最喜歡它的口感！比較有彈性！
必點指數：🍠🍠🍠🍠🍠
▪️蒜辣蝦 $520
蝦肉超彈牙，像龍蝦的那種感覺🤩大隻又新鮮～醬汁蒜辣香氣很棒，配上麵包簡直一百分💯
必點指數：🍠🍠🍠🍠🍠
▫️熟成旗魚 $450
特別的前菜料理，保有旗魚紮實肉質但不會難咬，特殊香料煙燻感很讚～加上炙燒後半生熟的質地蠻顛覆旗魚印象！調味淋上薄荷橄欖油搭配酸甜醃漬洋蔥，開胃！
必點指數：🍠🍠🍠🍠.5
▪️番茄燉牛肚 $450
使用牛的第四個胃，非常嫩又帶嚼勁，而且有把牛肚的香味煮進湯頭～不過調味不知為何覺得微微台式😆但蕃薯喜歡！
必點指數：🍠🍠🍠🍠.5
▫️特餐：鴨胸 $1750
會分成兩人份！鴨胸皮煎得像脆皮烤鴨，肉質很像牛排～多汁但不難咬，香料和蘑菇莓果醬汁很不錯！不過這道也有薄荷橄欖油不太愛😅而且排餐價格偏高～

"還記得2017/8時第一次踏入阿力
是因為呱吉的孤獨的美食廢人
當時與女友還對於偏高價的美食有些卻步
但仍選擇嘗試這間位於民生社區的小店
殊不知一試成主顧！
如今已變成我與女友生日或紀念日必訪的店家

菜單上永遠只有那幾樣
然而每次入口時，總會再次驚艷我們
從來不令我們失望

《葡萄牙蒜辣蝦》
一道永遠在變化的料理，每次去蒜辣蝦都長不太一樣，但可以確定的是，不斷地在變得更好吃。有別於西班牙的蒜辣蝦以充滿蒜味的橄欖油為基底，取而代之的是，濃厚鹹鮮甜組合的醬汁，把蝦的風味完全煮了進去，就是想點一盤麵包，把它沾的乾乾淨淨。蝦肉也是新鮮的沒話說，Q彈有勁兒，不帶一絲腥味

《招牌牛肚包》
牛肚軟嫩好入口，搭配自製的青醬，使得牛肚包多了一股羅勒的香氣，整體吃起來就是一股鹹鮮味不斷。搭配啤酒更是一大享受

《牛肝菌燉飯搭配溫泉蛋》
這是我至今為止，吃到最好吃的燉飯。燉飯的醬汁在剛入口時會呈現一股甜味，而後則是鮮味，咀嚼的過程伴隨半熟的米香與松露味，最後便是回味。一邊吃一邊伴著溫泉蛋，讓這盤燉飯少了些強烈，多了些溫潤。上面以墨魚汁做的脆皮，更是多了一份口感，使其變得更加強大

《海鮮墨魚麵》
必須說，這道料理確實與大家印象中的墨魚麵不同。通常墨魚麵都會搭配墨魚醬汁，然而阿力家的墨魚麵則不太一樣。醬汁與其說是醬，不如說是湯。充滿海洋鮮味的湯。這醬汁很特別，入口時第一直覺會是白醬，但醬汁卻不稠，反而有種清炒的清爽感。尾韻則帶有番茄的酸味和鮮味。只能說這盤義大利麵是白醬+紅醬+清炒的綜合體

《松露味薯條》
每次結尾時，只要還有點肚子，就會與女友點這一桶薯條。送上桌時總是滿滿的松露味。當然薯條也不馬虎，脆爽綿密。搭上帕瑪森起司、松露醬、松露油。真的是達成完美的和諧

距離上次造訪已經是半年前了

""Portuguese Garlic Spicy Shrimp""
A dish that is always changing. Every time you go to garlic and spicy shrimp, it is not the same, but it is certain that it is constantly becoming better.Different from Spanish garlic shrimp based on the olive oil full of garlic flavor, replaced by, the thick and salty combination of sauce, completely cooked the flavor of the shrimp, just want to order a plate of bread and dip it out of it Clean.The shrimp is also fresh and nothing to say, Q bombs are energetic, without a trace of fishy smell

""Signboard Belly Bag""
The beef belly is soft and tender, and the homemade green sauce makes the peels have a bales of Laler. The overall taste is a salty taste.It is a great enjoyment with beer

""Beef liver stew with hot spring eggs""
This is the best stewed rice for me so far.The sauce of the stewed rice will show a sweet taste at the entrance, and then it is umami. The chewing process is accompanied by the semi -cooked rice fragrant and truffle flavor, and finally the aftertaste.While eating with hot spring eggs, it made this plate of stewed rice less strong and more warm.The crispy skin made with cuttlefish juice above has a more taste, making it stronger

""Seafood Cordfish Noodles""
It must be said that this dish is indeed different from everyone's impression.The cuttlefish noodles are usually paired with cuttlefish sauce, but the cuttlefish noodles of the Ali family are not the same.The sauce is not as much as the sauce, it is better to say that it is soup.Soup full of ocean umami.This sauce is very special. At the entrance, the first intuition will be white sauce, but the sauce is not thick, but it has a kind of fried refreshing feeling.The tail rhyme has the sour taste and umami flavor of tomato.It can only be said that this Italian noodles are white sauce+red sauce+stir -fry complex

""Fire French French French French French fries""
At the end of each time, as long as you still have a belly, you will order this bucket of fries with your girlfriend.It is always full of truffle when I was delivered.Of course, the fries are not sloppy, crispy and dense.Put on the Parman cheese, truffle sauce, truffle oil.It's really a perfect harmony

最讓人驚艷的是甜點：達克瓦茲，濃郁酒香的蘭姆葡萄風味，是外面沒有的口味。甜而不膩，咬下葡萄乾的當下彷彿也品嚐了一杯美酒。當我翻到菜單甜點選項時，第一眼看到的直覺，果然沒錯！！

餐間詢問對於餐點的滿意度，代表一家店對於客人的體驗重視

美中不足的是餐廳方希望給客人一個優雅用餐、悠閒談心聊天的場所，店內香頌卻有點大聲，在座客人不得不大聲一點說話才能聽到對方的聲音….

聽說在阿力的時期可說是家庭用餐聚會的親子餐廳，老闆一改以前的走向：成人的酒食空間，相信老闆對於品味有自己的堅持。","Seriously, at the beginning, I felt that eating a meal was a bunch of meals ... Is it ...?IntersectionBut because these tedious rules bring a beautiful night ~~

From the photos taken on the wall, the ingenuity of the film board, to the small body design of the table, and then feel the taste and details of the boss.

Under the detailed explanation of the sommelier, the vegetable white asparagus, Portuguese cuttlefish and Italian Florence beef peels were clicked tonight. The white wine and red wine recommended by the sommeliers perfectly presented these three dishes. feature

The most amazing thing is the dessert: Dakwaz, the rich wine flavor of the strong wine, is a taste that is not outside.Sweet but not greasy, the moment when the raisins were bitten, it seemed to have tasted a glass of wine.When I turned to the menu dessert option, the intuition at first glance was true!Intersection

In the meal, the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the meal represents the importance of a shop's experience in the guests

The disadvantage of the United States is that the restaurant hopes to give the guests a place for a elegant meal and talk leisurely and chatting, but the in -store Xiang Song is a bit loud. The guests in the seat have to speak loudly to hear the other person's voice ....

"阿力真是不容易！
為了吃頓晚餐🥣，透過FB私訊訂位服務溝通協調來回確認就是為了確保現在疫情期間客人用餐🍴安全措施，很用心的店家！
住在這裏很久了，但一直沒有機會來吃過。上週要來巧遇元旦假期，認真查一下才發現原來他每周二、四公休。難怪我明明住在附近卻沒有吃過！！！
以菜單選擇來說看起來有點少，但是又剛好是我喜翻的⋯^o^相見恨晚

第一道 上來的是 《男人味》 炸薯🍠條
看到這名字實在讓人很難不注意⚠️到它，所謂的男人🧍‍♂️味原來指的是 孜然的調味。

第二道 蒜辣蝦 🧄🦐
這道菜算是開味菜，一共有6隻蝦，蝦子口感挺鮮。重點是醬汁的調味實在是太好吃😋⋯⋯一定要加點麵包來沾著吃。 我吃到後面怕太飽後面的飯會吃不下，甚至還直接用湯匙🥄喝⋯

第三道 蛤蠣&松阪豬葡萄牙🇵🇹鍋飯
我有點誤會了，原來以為會是跟西班牙海鮮燉飯一樣全部都在一鍋裡，沒想到原來飯是獨立的！
鍋子裏有山一樣多的蛤蠣/松阪豬/馬鈴薯🥔/洋蔥🧅/菇🍄⋯⋯去悶煮，食材都很入味。醬汁也不錯就是偏鹹了一點點🤏，可能因為蛤蠣本身帶鹹又撒起司🧀️粉（自己瞎猜的）所以湯汁既使淋在飯上吃還是略鹹了些但食材不會唷！

總之，今晚我很滿意！
由於用餐前有看過店家FB，不想人物被拍所以就沒有拍店內拍照啦！用完餐大約7:30左右，客人也陸續入座將近滿座了！

對了，很重要訊息✉️分享！
疫情期間阿力的搖滾廚房不接待散客⋯建議大家有興趣前往一定要先訂位唷！","Ali is really not easy!
In order to eat dinner, it is confirmed to be confirmed back and forth through the FB private message booking service communication.
I have been here for a long time, but I have never had a chance to eat it.Last week, I had to meet the New Year's Day holiday last week. After careful check, I found out that he was closed every Tuesday and Thursday.No wonder I have lived nearby but never eaten!IntersectionIntersection
In terms of menu selection, it looks a bit less, but I just happened to be uphill.

The first is ""Man"" fried French fries
It is really difficult to see this name. ⚠ ️ to it, the so -called man 🧍‍♂️ taste originally refers to the seasoning of cumin.

Second, garlic spicy shrimp 蒜
This dish is a delicious dish, with a total of 6 shrimp, and the shrimp taste is quite fresh.The point is that the seasoning of the sauce is so delicious. You must add some bread to eat.I ’m afraid that I ca n’t eat the meals behind it, and even drink it directly with a spoon.

Third Clam Oyster & Matsusaka Portuguese Portuguese 🇵🇹 锅 第 第
I was a bit misunderstood. I thought it would be in the pot like Spanish seafood stewed rice. I didn't expect the original rice was independent!
In the pot, there is a mountain as many oysters/Matsusaka pigs/potato 🥔/onion 🧅/mushrooms.The sauce is also good, but it is a little bit salty. It may be because the oysters itself is salty and sprinkled with the dealer 🧀️ Fan (guessed by myself), so the soup is slightly salty on the rice, but the ingredients will not be a bit salty, but the ingredients will not be the ingredients. Oh!

In short, I am very satisfied tonight!
Since I have seen the store FB before the meal, I do n’t want the characters to be photographed, so I did n’t take pictures in the shop!About 7:30 after meals, guests have been seated one after another!

"這一篇我思考多天但還是決定上來分享。先說總體經驗：用餐當晚(4月7號)，我是帶著愉悅的心情離開餐廳的。🥰🥰

我其實也忘了是怎麼看到這間餐廳的，因為看評價跟官方粉絲頁感覺是有趣的私廚，所以就決定在生日月來試試看。

在訂位時的感覺這是一間格調拉滿，頗有態度的店家🤘🤘。我個人還滿喜歡這種風格的，因為每間店都有自己想要的客人跟態度。一開始直接了當說明清楚，不浪費雙方時間，我覺得是件好事情。

在訂位的說明中有特別註明：不要塗抹味道過於濃烈的香水🌺🌺。非常深得我心。因為吃飯就是五感的體驗，而嗅覺往往都是被犧牲的。不是被鄰桌的客人，就有可能是餐廳或廚房本身的味道。而且只接待每組客人2人以下的訂位。
而因為這樣嚴謹的訂位過程，讓我感覺這應該是間價格偏高的私廚。因為我是一人用餐，所以在訂位的時候，餐廳有註明將我安排在高腳椅區。

當晚抵達的時候，服務生出來在街邊幫我量了體溫，噴了酒精並且說明用餐的規則：拍照可以，但為了其他客人的隱私，所以拍照範圍僅以餐桌桌面為主。我詢問是否可以拍門面的照片，也因為隱私的關係而無法拍照。而服務生也說明餐廳想提供火車餐車🚂一種愉快舒適的氛圍。我當下心想：這是一個商務艙的等級呀 :)

但期待永遠跟現實有一定的差距存在的。整體下來，不是商務艙，是豪經艙。餐點跟酒水有一定的程度，單價也屬於中間。因為我那天是以蔬菜還有海鮮為主。配了3杯酒都是白酒🥂，每杯價位位於360上下。一份前菜(布拉塔起司)，熟沙拉(青花筍+玉米筍)+海膽醬碳烤小花枝，大約1200。所以我認為餐點酒水的水準跟價位還是滿符合的。

那落差是在甚麼地方體現的? 我個人認為有以下幾點：
1. 我覺得我的隱私很差 😂。因為我是坐在高腳椅區，而且服務生(其實我應該稱她侍酒師，她真的是侍酒師)請我坐在面向大門的方向。然後我整個用餐的過程，外面路過的路人甲乙丙丁，因為餐廳風格獨具的門面老是會透過窗戶往內看。我就是一直與那些人視線相對的客人👀。我不能說這是個大問題，但是我反而沒有那種隱私被保護得很好的感覺。

2. 沒有輕鬆自在。除了剛剛的隱私問題之外。或許也是我先入為主的想法。在私廚裡面坐高腳椅應該是在吧檯面對主廚。而且高腳椅應該要有椅背。畢竟，吃飯也不是像喝酒。可以快速地喝完或是到處走動。在兩個小時中，偏小沒有椅背的小高腳椅確實讓我吃得腰酸背痛。這個問題我有當下反應給侍酒師，她是說下次可以先跟他們確認。🧐

3. 對，兩個小時。三道菜我吃了兩個小時🐢。其實那天是屬於客滿的狀態。總共五組客人，9個人。但只有一位侍酒師負責：到餐廳外面幫客人量體溫消毒說明用餐規定與帶位，點餐，說明如何點酒(因為沒有酒單)，出餐，說明菜色，收桌整理，照顧客人。她真的很忙，忙到我都於心不忍。但同時，我也因為為了等她有空來幫我介紹下一隻酒與添酒，我的碳烤小章魚都等到涼涼了🐙🐙。這個問題我也有當面反應。我認為他們應該請多一個外場。🛎

4. 菜品與酒的搭配。其實侍酒師推薦的每支酒都各有特色也好喝，但可惜的是我並沒有覺得跟我的菜品有特別搭配。其實 pairing 是一件不確定性很高的事情，我反而建議可以用固定的paring 菜單可以更精準的確保品質並提高效率

5. 終於講到食物了。我對於我的前菜跟熟沙拉是很滿意的。分量對一個人來說是有點偏多的。但主菜海膽醬碳烤小章魚就是比較迷惑的一道菜。迷惑第一點也是我自己的原因：我就沒有偏愛小章魚，我為甚麼要點？喔~~~因為我熱愛海膽。我100%衝著海膽醬點了這道菜。在官網中那濃稠的海膽醬，我光看我都可以想像到她的味道。但是，迷惑的第二點來了。我在吃的時候，我沒有感受到海膽醬反而是那淡淡的臭豆腐味特別搶戲。因為小章魚的Q彈+那微臭的味道再加上羅勒，我一度以為我在吃大腸。我有當下跟侍酒師還有主廚反應。詢問是否有加入魚露，果不其然。好吧，迷惑的魚露。我是不大理解，魚露無法提鮮海膽的香氣呀。
當下主廚有說可以重做一份給我。但其實我沒有不喜歡，我個人很愛臭豆腐跟蚵仔麵線。我只是迷惑。再來我也不喜歡浪費食物，所以只要我可以接受，我通常都會吃完。最後，就是就算多給我一份，我也吃不下。但最終，因為涼涼的小章魚更顯鹹味，我還是剩了兩個沒有吃。😅

好，以上就是我覺得造成我的落差感的地方。但是在服務的部分不論侍酒師或是主廚都表現得非常可圈可點。他們知道是我的生日月，還送我一個好吃的布丁🍮(真的很好吃)，也在一桌客人離開後，讓我換到一般的桌子，可以好好放鬆休息的喝我最後加點一杯的 Riesling 與吃好吃的布丁。還是很謝謝老皮衣，希望您們更好

P.S. 其實當晚他們還有傳訊給我，詢問我的感受，很貼心。我也簡短如實地回復以上相關幾點。💖💖","I thought about this for many days but decided to share it.Let's talk about overall experience: On the evening of dining (April 7), I left the restaurant with a happy mood.Bleak

In fact, I also forgot how to see this restaurant. Because the evaluation and the official fan page felt that it was an interesting private kitchen, I decided to try it at the birthday month.

When you order, this is a store full of style.I personally like this style, because each store has the guests and attitudes they want.At the beginning, it was clear that it was a good thing.

There are special indications in the description of the booking: Do not apply perfume 🌺🌺 with too strong flavor.Very deeply my heart.Because eating is the experience of five senses, and the sense of smell is often sacrificed.It is not a guest at the neighboring table, it may be the taste of the restaurant or kitchen itself.And only receive or less reservations for each group of guests.
And because of such a rigorous booking process, I feel that this should be a private kitchen with a high price.Because I was dining alone, when I was ordering, the restaurant stated that I arranged me in the high chair area.

When I arrived that night, the waiter came out of the street to help me measure my body temperature, sprayed alcohol, and explained the rules of dining: taking pictures, but for the privacy of other guests, the scope of the camera was only based on the table tabletop.I asked if I could take photos on the facade, and I couldn't take pictures because of privacy.The waiter also shows that the restaurant wants to provide a train dining car 🚂 a pleasant and comfortable atmosphere.I thought now: This is a level of business class :)

But there is a gap between expectations and reality forever.Overall, it is not a business class, but a magnificent cabin.The meal has a certain degree of drinking, and the unit price belongs to the middle.Because I was mainly vegetables and seafood that day.With 3 glasses of wine, it is a white wine, and the price of each cup is located around 360.A former dish (Blata cheese), cooked salad (blue and white bamboo shoots+corn bamboo shoots)+sea urchin sauce carbon roasted small flower branches, about 1200.So I think the level of meals is still in line with the price.

Where is the difference? I personally think that there are the following points:
1. I think my privacy is poor.Because I was sitting in the high chair area, and the waiter (in fact, I should call her sommelier, she is really a sommelier), I asked me to sit in the direction of the door.Then the whole meal of me, the passerby passing outside, the dining of the passerby, because the restaurant's unique facade always looked through the window.I am a guest who has always looked at those people.I can't say that this is a big problem, but I don't have that kind of privacy that is well protected.

2. No easy comfort.Except for privacy issues just now.Perhaps it is my preconceived idea.Sitting in a tall chair in private chefs should face the chef at the bar.And high -foot chairs should have a chair back.After all, eating is not like drinking.You can drink quickly or walk around.In two hours, a small tall chair with a small back of the chair did allow me to eat back pain.I have the current response to the sommelier. She means that I can confirm with them next time.Bleak

3. Yes, two hours.I ate for two hours for three dishes.In fact, that day was full.A total of five groups of guests, 9 people.But only one sommelier is responsible: go outside the restaurant to help guests in order to disinfect the body temperature to disinfect the dining regulations and bands, order meals, explain how to order (because there is no wine list), go to the meal, explain the dishes, collect the table, take care of the guests, take care of the guests, take care of the guests, take care of the guests EssenceShe was really busy, so busy that I couldn't bear it.But at the same time, because I was waiting for her to introduce the next wine and add wine, my carbon roasted small octopus waited until it was cold.I also have this problem in person.I think they should invite one more outside.Bleak

4. The combination of dishes and wine.In fact, each wine recommended by the sommelier has its own characteristics and is good, but unfortunately I don't think it is specially matched with my dishes.In fact, Pairing is a very uncertainty. Instead, I suggest that you can use a fixed Paring menu to ensure the quality and improve efficiency

5. Finally talk about food.I am very satisfied with my former dish and cooked salad.The weight is a bit too much for a person.But the main dish, sea urchin sauce carbon roasted small octopus is a more confusing dish.The first point of confusion is my own reason: I don't prefer small octopus, why do I point out?Oh ~~~ Because I love sea urchins.I ordered the dish at 100%for sea urchin sauce.On the thick sea urchin sauce on the official website, I can imagine her taste.However, the second point of confusion came.When I was eating, I didn't feel that the sea urchin sauce was a faint smell of stinky tofu.Because of the small octopus's Q bombs+the smell of the slightly smelly smell, plus Laler, I thought I was eating the large intestine.I have reacted with the sommelier and chef.Ask if there is a fish sauce, it is no way.Well, confused fish dew.I don't understand much, Yu Lu can't lift the aroma of sea urchin.
The current chef said that he could redefine it for me.But in fact, I don't like it. I personally love stinky tofu and Taipa noodles.I'm just confused.I don't like to waste food again, so as long as I can accept it, I usually eat it.In the end, even if I gave me more, I couldn't eat it.But in the end, because the cool little octopus was more salty, I still left two without eating.Bleak

Okay, the above is the place where I think it causes my sense of gap.However, the service section is very remarkable regardless of whether the sommelier or the chef.They knew it was my birthday month, and I gave me a delicious pudding (really delicious). After a table of guests left, let me change to the ordinary table. I can relax and rest. A cup of Riesling and delicious pudding.I still thank the old pimi, I hope you will be better

P.S. Actually, they still had a message that night to ask me, and asked me how she felt, and was very intimate.I also briefly respond to the above related points on the spot.Bleak",False,0.134,0.041,0.825,0.9992

- 炸薯條-蒜味: 爽脆的薯條搭配著些微的生蒜, 帶來些微的清爽, 搭配上葡萄醋醬, 把單一薯條的風味, 再多添了一點酸甜.

- 十日熟成胭脂鴨: 肉質飽滿多汁, 鴨肉韻味非常足夠, 恰到好出的外皮以及鴨肉溫度拿捏恰當的粉色, 視覺上非常誘人, 搭配著肉汁所作的醬汁食用, 可說是來一場與鴨肉的戀愛對決.

-The hand -made comprehensive bread: naked wheat bread, cuttlefish bread, and Berio, plenty of wheat's wheat aroma and crispy, the unique seafood and sweetness of cuttlefish, British soft milk fragrance, with soup, all have a taste.

-Portic clams stewed pork: Generally, the flavor of the spice that is not easy to eat. The combination of pork and oysters is also quite rare. The soup is not only meaty but also has the sea flavor of the oysters. Soft but chewy, the oysters are very full, and it is a bread killer.

-French fries-garlic flavor: The crispy fries are paired with slightly raw garlic, which brings a slight refreshment. With grape vinegar sauce, the flavor of a single fries is added a little bit of sweet and sweet.

"還在想說台北沒有葡萄牙菜, 沒想到朋友介紹的老皮衣就還真有幾道葡菜, 而且老闆自己有葡萄牙南北趴趴走的經驗, 做的口味很豐富精緻, 也是我的第一次分子料理體驗(蔬食餐盤那兩坨醬就是了)
一、餐酒是一大重點, 在酒的挑選上有幾款可選, 今天點海鮮多, 就四選一挑了一杯白酒, 依照片左到右順序, 我喝白酒經驗不多, 但右邊兩瓶是清爽偏酸的白葡萄酒, 左一則是單寧較深且顏色更金黃的葡萄酒(店家介紹因日照充足, 葡萄釀製的味道跟顏色都不一樣)

二、熟成炙燒旗魚佐醃洋蔥, 綠綠的都是初榨橄欖油+蒔蘿, 神奇的是我很怕小茴香這類的味道, 但吃起來卻不反感, 而且這整道醃洋蔥的關係, 是偏甜的且有焦糖洋蔥的淡味, 認真說很粉紅的造型和口味(因為偏甜~~~) 但旗魚炙燒關係, 外層跟內層味道也大不相同, 一起嚼的時候會混搭, 這點滿奇妙的

三、蔬食dish很特別, 主角是幾根大玉米筍, 烤的有香, 然後盤子裡有醬油色的奶油醬跟兩坨特別的醬, 經理說這是打氮氣做的醬, 灰色是菊芋, 白色是花椰菜&米&cheese做成的, 這是分子料理手法之一, 真是太特殊了, 第一次體驗嘗了一口, 好神奇的搭法, 一盤菜變成三種醬輪流沾著吃, 這道第一次來建議必點

四、蒜辣蝦(我點不辣)
這道菜只有兩個重點, 跟上一道不同(疏食很忙,要搭醬又要配酒品嚐)蝦肉&醬汁，蝦的部分是又彈又扎實, 醬的部分我一點一點嚐到整個用餐結束為止, 為何大蒜炒奶油是這味道? 我炒過啊~味道不是這樣的, 應該是老闆用的奶油不同, 這個我就不方便問了, 但吃得出來蒜沒有炒到酥, 就是白白的就可用了, 而且有橄欖油的香氣, 味道上是純粹而精緻的.  不過這裡每道菜醬汁會稍微鹹, 我想是為了讓食材夠味吧

五、葡萄牙蛤蠣燉豬肉
這道真的很家常菜口味, 是葡萄牙的大雜燴, 但是人家葡萄牙大雜燴有海鮮阿, 還是滿鮮的~ 然後這裡面有葡式臘腸, 他吃起來跟必勝客的臘腸有像, 可是不會死鹹, 然後湯汁就不像前面好像都精燉過, 比較水像排骨湯(味道不像~你自己去吃就知道了), 最後吃這道是配紅酒, 直接點了一杯單寧重的, 但好像蓋過去菜的味道了, 下次應該點淡一點的~

這間私廚口味很專業, 空間管理上是按門鈴裡面才能開的門, 價格上也比我預期要低~ 期待秋冬更新菜單了, 到時在找人來一起吃, 感謝招待","I still want to say that there are no Portuguese cuisine in Taipei. I did not expect that the old leather coat introduced by my friends really had a few poutees, and the boss had the experience of walking from the North and South of Portugal. The taste was rich and exquisite. Cooking experience (the two sauce of the vegetables and food plates are the same)
1. Meal wine is a big focus. There are a few options for the selection of wine. Today, I order more seafood. I choose a glass of liquor in four. According to the left to the right, I have little experience in drinking liquor. Two bottles are refreshing and sour white wines, and the left is a deeper and golden wine on the left.

Second, cooked burning flagfish pickled onions, the green ones are virgin olive oil+tadpoles. The magical thing is that I am afraid of the taste of cumin, but it does not dislike it, and the whole pickled onion The relationship is a light flavor of caramel and onion. Seriously, it is very pink shape and taste (because it is sweet ~~~) but the flames are burning. The outer layer is very different from the inner layer. It will be mixed and match when it is, this is wonderful

Third, the vegetable and food Dish is very special. The protagonist is a few large corn bamboo shoots. The roasted ones are fragrant. Then there are soy sauce cream sauce and two special sauce in the plate. The manager said that this is a sauce made by nitrogen. Gray is chrysanthemum taro. White is made of broccoli & rice & cheese. This is one of the molecular cooking techniques. It is really too special. The first experience was tasted. The magical method of mixing. This is the first time I comes to suggest

Fourth, garlic and spicy shrimp (I order not spicy)
There are only two key points in this dish, keeping up with the same difference (very busy food, you need to put on sauce and have wine to taste) Shrimp & sauce, the shrimp part is bombarded and solid, the part of the sauce is little bit by little little by little When the whole meal is ends, why is the taste of garlic fried cream? I have fry it ~ The taste is not like this. It should be different from the cream used by the boss. It can be used in vain, and the aroma of olive oil is pure and exquisite in taste. However, every vegetable sauce here will be slightly salty here. I think it is to make the ingredients taste enough.

5. Portuguese clams stewed pork
This is really good -looking. It is Portugal's hodgepodge, but the Portuguese hodgepodge has seafood, which is still fresh ~ Then there are Portuguese sausages. Then the soup is not like stewed in front of it, and it looks like pork rib soup (the taste is not like ~ you know it if you eat it yourself). Finally, you eat this. It seems that the taste of the past dishes, it should be lighter time ~

很高興店主願意回應，

After watching the shop owner's response, I want to make a few clarifications
I didn't expect the CP value to be very high.
It may be because I read the evaluation of others.Yes, it is a very subjective feeling, but I haven't said it is not delicious, but I feel that it does not seem to meet the price, and it can be said that it does not match expectations.Of course, I think the restaurant has a good atmosphere and a good service attitude. I should have written it.
If you open a shop on the side of the road, it is good to be good. Of course, I think it is good.
That's right, Guidi does not charge the service fee in modern times, which is full of humanity and sincerity, but it is not a small number of stores with no service fee and good service.
I am glad that the owner is willing to respond,
The intention and creativity of meals can be seen.
I just write the current feelings,
There is nothing wrong with meals, which has an impact on personal opinions and expectations. I look forward to the owner of the shopkeeper to continue to launch the intentional and loved meal :)",False,0.156,0.039,0.805,0.9918
