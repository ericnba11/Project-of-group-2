"整體評分：79
在青樓搬家前和家人來吃，裝潢很有特色，古色古香的，當天座位在地下室，不知道是不是因為在地下室，所以服務人員比較少下來（？）
比較可惜是因為跟家人來，要開車沒有能品嘗到特色酒品，但大致上菜色是還不錯的
但是沒有預訂東坡肉，失策～

不知是不是較偏向餐酒館，個人已經吃滿重口味的，菜的口味還都稍覺偏重，有種較適合配酒的感覺XD
但是川辣的菜色都很夠勁，辣度就比較看個人，本身吃比較辣，覺得辣度還算可以，水煮牛很好吃，蒜香脆皮雞（要預訂）也很好吃（真想來杯酒啊～

這裡很適合商務喝酒的飯局，對於中式餐酒館來說是好吃的，但對一般家庭聚餐的話價位偏高、量偏少，因為家人較不吃辣，很多辣菜沒吃到，有機會再來試試要預定的東坡肉、烤鴨三吃跟酒品！","Overall score: 79
Come to eat with my family before moving in the Qinglou. The decoration is very distinctive. It is antique. The seat was in the basement that day. I do n’t know if it was because in the basement, so there are fewer service staff (?)
It is a pity that because I came with my family, I did n’t have to taste the special wine, but it ’s not bad for the rough food
But there is no reservation Dongpo meat, it is lost ~

I don't know if it is more biased towards the dining tavern. Individuals are already full of heavy taste.
However, Sichuan spicy dishes are very strong, and the spicy degree is more dependent on individuals. It is more spicy in itself. It feels that the spicy degree is okay. The boiled beef is delicious, and the garlic is crispy. Want to drink wine ~

It is very suitable for business drinking meals. It is delicious for Chinese dining tavern, but the price of general family dinner is high and small, because the family is less spicy. Come and try Dongpo meat, roast duck three and wine products you want to book!",False

"網路評價（負）多數都是蠻中肯，調酒真的大勝餐點，烤鴨肉柴就算了，鴨肉粥還鹹到難以入口，難怪酒水喝不停😅
另外十分懷疑我們吃的是一開始上桌展示的那隻烤鴨，實際份量少到誇張，其他餐廳的烤鴨隨便都切出兩大盤鴨皮+胸肉，我們這隻只片出十多片🤔三個人沒吃飽😅

沒有想像中的好，可能被好評預期拉高了。烤鴨不算好，鴨肉鴨皮片的技術普通了點，通常會有些只有皮有些帶點肉，這家是全帶肉，鴨肉鴨皮也不香。有一個油條包蝦子是好吃的。但鴨粥跟鹹蛋莧菜味道平淡。年輕人服務算蠻熱情，店內裝潢也很有味道。不過以這個收費食物是有待加強。,"Without imagination, it may be raised by praise expectations.The roast duck is not good. The technology of duck meat and duck skin is generally a little bit. Usually, there are only some skin with a little meat. This one is full of meat, and the duck meat duck skin is not fragrant.It is delicious with a fritter and shrimp.But duck porridge and salted eggs are plain.The service of young people is quite enthusiastic, and the interior of the store is also very delicious.However, this charging food needs to be strengthened.",False

"✅餐飲
第一次來點了寶島三杯雞、XO醬蝦漿油條、肉末茄子配白飯。這三道都算是很重口味、油、下飯的。因為身體的緣故，這次沒喝到酒，只能下回再體驗。

「寶島三杯雞」的雞肉有先炸過，把雞腿肉的鮮嫩留住。糖不加多，吃多也不膩。其中，薑片、大蒜的香甜也都有保留住。

「XO醬蝦漿油條」有特色非常推！本來擔心兩人分食到最後會膩到吃不完，沒想到即使放超過10分鐘，油條也沒顯得出油或軟趴趴，有驚艷到。

「肉末茄子」用砂鍋煮，包溫度很夠。即使上菜了40分鐘，每次夾都還是燙到要吹一吹再吃。

✅服務
現場的人員都很親切，上菜速度非常快！如果詢問菜色介紹，也都能說出個所以然。

✅氛圍
入門的扭轉乾坤很可愛😍

整個店的氛圍很一致，中式復古風，但不會顯得連假。包含桌椅也是有一定份量。
桌子地板不會油膩，整理的很乾淨。

桌型種類多，圓桌 方桌 長桌都有，方便各種人數組合來用餐。","✅ ✅
For the first time, I ordered three cups of chicken, XO sauce shrimp fritters, minced meat eggplant with white rice.These three roads are considered very heavy taste, oil, and rice.Because of the body, I did n’t drink this time, and I can only experience it next time.

The chicken of ""Three Cups of Chicken in Treasure Island"" fry it first, retaining the tenderness of the chicken legs.Do not add too much sugar, and not greasy to eat.Among them, the sweetness of ginger slices and garlic is also retained.

""XO sauce shrimp paste fritter"" is very unique!I was worried that the two would not be tired of eating until the end. I did not expect that even if it was put for more than 10 minutes, the fritters did not seem to be oil or soft, which was amazing.

""Minced meat eggplant"" is cooked in a casserole, and the bag temperature is enough.Even if it was served for 40 minutes, every time the clip was hot, it was hot to blow again.

The people at the scene were very kind, and the food was very fast!If you ask the dishes, you can say why.

"🍴青樓中式餐酒館

餐點⬇️

俺不是臭豆腐 $350 🌶️
［推］店家推薦我們想說就來點一下，名字很特別以外吃法也特別，這道是使用客家小炒的方式去製作的，把以往客家小炒的豆乾換成臭豆腐，單聞味道臭但吃起來很美味，越咬越香，但整個口中都充滿臭豆腐的味道，同時也是一道很下飯的菜。

無錫排骨 $590
［推］這道同樣是菜單上的推薦，一上菜份量非常十足，肉量超級誇張超大塊，有點像是控肉的概念，可是醬汁口味偏甜，但肉整體很嫩口一咬就化開。

蒜香脆皮雞-半隻/一隻(需預訂) $680
［推］這道是今日最好吃，但是必須事先預訂，提醒大家在打電話或是線上訂位時要記得跟店員說，或者是被住在in-line訂位上的備註欄內，就可以事先預訂，那雞肉看似乾巴巴的，但一咬下去整個皮很薄脆之外肉也非常鮮嫩多汁，這是我們大家最喜歡的Top.1第一名，非常必點呢！

梨山蒜香炒菲力 $680
［推］這道雖然菜單內也是推薦可是我個人覺得還好，因為牛肉的部分非常嫩也非常多汁好吃，可是醬汁的調味太濃整個把牛肉的好給蓋過去了，完全吃不太到牛肉的香甜，覺得非常可惜浪費。

XO醬蝦漿油條 $480 🌶️
［推］一看名稱不用店家寫推薦我也會點，油條包裹蝦漿就是非常必點的一道料理，外酥內軟的口感無人能敵，味道也非常入味，並且不會因為有醬汁導致有條不酥脆，那口感還是非常好的，大推👍🏻

雙味鴛鴦蝦球-金沙/芥末美乃滋 $680
［推］原本想點川味麻辣蝦球但覺得好像太多辣味的餐點了我們就換個口味轉換一下，蝦子非常大隻外面裹粉皮也非常薄脆，再搭配上金沙炒非常合胃口這道算是鹹甜鹹甜，因為另一個芥末美乃滋口味是屬於甜口的，那香氣像是早餐店的那種芥末醬汁，雖然感覺普通但是意外的搭配。

川味麻辣皮蛋 $320 🌶️
皮蛋的口感脆脆軟軟，感覺是有先炸過再去炒開，也是非常下飯的料理，而且份量一樣非常十足，不會沒吃幾塊就找不到皮蛋在那。

季節時蔬《水蓮》-清炒/蒜蓉 $280
很難得吃到這麼好吃的水蓮，以為水蓮就是那樣平常清炒，但是他有貼心的剪短之外那口感非常脆口，不會炒過軟過硬苦掉，而且通常很多店家都是炒麻油我個人很不喜歡，但這邊單純炒個蒜頭就很香了，超推薦大家點，一口一口夾停不下來。

鹹魚雞粒炒飯 $320
每次看到炒飯就一定必點，何況其實很少地方有鹹魚雞粒炒飯，因為它是比較偏屬於港式的料理，飯非常好吃香氣撲鼻，也很有味道，但也變成有點符合台灣人口味不會太鹹，雞肉也很嫩很多汁不會因為切丁狀而乾巴巴的。

海鮮干燒伊麵 $480
這道是今日最不好吃，雖然店員介紹時本就有提醒麵體口感偏軟，但是不知道吃到的時候是非常軟爛，軟爛之外又非常的沒有味道感覺像是沒有調味，只有油油的口感，也沒有太多海鮮味，大家用了一碗但是沒人有吃完，真的是吃不下去那種，原本想說要個醬料做搭配，但是還是想說算了，下次還是專點店家推薦的菜品比較不踩雷。

干貝魚子燒賣 4顆 $180
干貝薄薄一片放在燒賣上，吃起來很普通也沒特別的風味或是海鮮的鮮甜，建議大家不用特別點。

櫻花蝦香菇燒賣 4顆 $180
這道燒賣一樣，或許是燒賣沒有特別讓人驚艷的地方，但是口味也沒有什麼味道，也是要靠沾醬，也不需要特別點這道。

🍡甜品
酥炸脆皮馬蹄條 4條 $150
這道甜品很特別，外面是使用春捲的皮去包裹馬蹄，軟軟QQ的感覺口感像是甜甜的蘿蔔糕，小朋友應該會很喜歡。

奶黃流沙包 4顆 $180
［推］這道也是不用店家推薦就會想點的餐點，包子外軟內有金黃流沙，滿好吃的，但是感覺味道偏淡沒有以往吃的流沙包更多的流沙也更有鹹味。

🍹飲品
古早味楊桃汁 $100
朋友點說非常好喝，是真的楊桃汁，裡面充滿沈澱果肉，很好喝。

仙女氣泡-仙女配方，玫瑰檸檬風味 $100
這杯飲品真的是很好喝，不僅外觀夏天可愛，還很解渴，玫瑰香氣很重在搭配檸檬氣泡非常中和不會死甜，很推女生點這杯。

🍺酒品
十八天啤酒 $180","酒 餐 🍴 🍴 🍴 🍴 🍴 🍴 🍴

Meal ⬇ ️

I am not stinky tofu $ 350 🌶️
[Push] The store recommends that if we want to say, let ’s take a little bit. But it tastes delicious, the more fragrant, but the taste of stinky tofu in the whole mouth, and it is also a very good dish.

Wuxi ribs $ 590
[Push] This is also a recommendation on the menu. The amount of serving is very full, the meat mass is super exaggerated and large, it is a bit like the concept of controlling meat, but the sauce taste is sweet, but the meat as a whole is very tender and the mouth is very tender. Open.

Garlic crispy leather chicken-half/one (need to book) $ 680
[Push] This is the best today, but you must book in advance to remind everyone that when calling or online reservation, remember to tell the clerk, or you are living in the note column in the IN-LINE booking position. You can book it in advance. The chicken seems to be dry, but the whole skin is very crispy as soon as it is bitten. This is the first place in our favorite TOP.1, which is very necessary!

Lishan garlic frying Fili $ 680
[Push] Although this menu is also recommended in the menu, I personally think it is okay, because the beef part is very tender, very juicy and delicious, but the flavor of the sauce is too strong. It is too sweet to feel the sweetness of beef.

Xo sauce shrimp paste churros $ 480 🌶️
[Push] When you look at the name, you will order it without writing recommendations. The fritters wrap the shrimp paste is a very necessary dish. The soft and soft texture of the outside is no one. As a result, there is no crispy, the taste is still very good, push

Two-flavored shrimp ball-Sands/Mustard Mikon $ 680
[Push] Originally I wanted to order the spicy spicy shrimp balls of Chuanwei, but it seemed like a meal that was too spicy. Let ’s change the taste. The shrimp is very large and the skin is very crispy. It is salty and sweet, because the other mustard beauty flavor belongs to sweetness. The aroma looks like the mustard sauce in the breakfast shop. Although it feels ordinary but unexpectedly matched.

Sichuan flavor spicy preserved egg $ 320 🌶️
The taste of the preserved egg is crispy and soft. It feels like it is fried first before frying. It is also a very good dish, and the portion is very full. If you do n’t eat a few pieces, you ca n’t find the preserved egg.

Seasonal Vegetable ""Water Lotus"" -Chika fry/garlic $ 280
It's hard to eat such a delicious water lotus, thinking that the water lotus is so speculated that, but he has a very crispy taste that he has intimate cutting, and it will not be soft and hard, and usually many stores are all stores. I do n’t like the frying oil oil, but it ’s very fragrant here to fry a garlic here.

Salted fish chicken grain fried rice $ 320
Every time you see fried rice, you must order, not to mention that there are few places with salted fish and chicken granules, because it is a Hong Kong -style dish. The rice is very delicious. It is not too salty in accordance with the taste of Taiwan, and the chicken is very tender. Many juice will not be dried because of cut -oriented.

Seafood dried roasted noodles $ 480
This is the worst delicious today. Although the clerk introduced the texture of the face body when it was introduced, I did n’t know that when I was eaten, it was very soft, and it was very bad. The taste of the oil and oil does not have much seafood. Everyone used a bowl but no one had finished eating. It really couldn't eat it. Originally, I wanted to say that a sauce was matched, but I still want to say it. Next time, the dishes recommended by the store will not step on the thunder.

Dry scallop caviar sells 4 pieces of $ 180
The scallops are thinly placed on the burning, it tastes very ordinary and has no special flavor or the sweetness of seafood. It is recommended that you do not need to special.

Sakura shrimp shiitake mushrooms are sold for 4 pieces of $ 180
This burning is the same. Perhaps the burning is not particularly amazing, but the taste has no taste. It also depends on dipping sauce, and it does not need to be special.

Dessert
Crispy crispy skin horse hoof strip 4 $ 150
This dessert is very special. The outside of the spring roll is used to wrap the horseshoe. The soft QQ feels like a sweet radish cake. Children should like it very much.

4 pieces of milk yellow flowing sand bag $ 180
[Push] This is also a meal that you don't need to think about if you don't need to recommend it. The soft sand outside the bun is full of golden flowing sand, which is delicious, but it feels lighter. Essence

"1.環境：4.5⭐️
蠻特別的中式裝潢，小包廂內有KTV，吃飯娛樂兼具，很適合團體聚餐。

2菜色：

花椒燒蛋：4⭐️
花椒和煎蛋蠻搭，很下飯，不過吃的時候不小心咬到花椒子會稍微影響口感。

金銀蛋莧菜：5⭐️
莧菜皮蛋和大蒜完美融合，大推👍

祖傳原味香腸：2.5⭐️
很普通的香腸片，吃不出有什麼特別的

蒜香脆皮雞：3⭐️
雞肉很嫩，皮烤的焦脆，但吃不出蒜香，且當天的雞肉吃起來有一點說不上來的味道

東坡肉：4.5⭐️
肉燉的非常軟嫩，吃起來甜鹹適中，非常下飯。

俺不是豆腐 3.5⭐️
豆腐據說是臭豆腐做的，不過吃起來沒有臭豆腐的臭與外酥內嫩的口感，比較像是一道用臭豆腐條做的客家小炒。

XO蝦醬油條 5⭐️
非常特別的一道菜，味道吃了印象深刻，大推👍

一品海鮮豆腐煲3.5⭐️
海鮮料很多誠意滿滿，但豆腐偏少，味道一般

油炸鬼炒牛肉 3⭐️
不配飯吃會覺得蠻鹹的，味道一般

流沙奶皇包 3⭐️
流沙包的內餡味道非常清淡，回訪不會想再點。

結論：菜單很多想吃但沒有點到的，多吃幾次避開覺得普通的菜色的話，會是一間讓人想一再回訪的餐廳

實際星評為4-4.5⭐️","1. Environment: 4.5 4️
It is quite a special Chinese -style decoration. There are KTV in the small box. They have both dinner and entertainment, which is very suitable for group dinner.

2 dishes:

Pepper -roasted egg: 4蛋️
The peppercorns and fried eggs are very delicious, but it will affect the taste slightly when I accidentally bite the peppercorns when I eat it.

Gold and silver eggs and amaranth: 5菜️️
Amaranth eggs and garlic are perfectly fused, pushing 👍

Ancestral original sausage: 2.5⭐️
Very ordinary sausage slices, there is no special specialty

Garlic crispy leather chicken: 3 皮️
The chicken is very tender, the skin is crispy, but it can’t eat garlic, and the chicken that day has a little taste that can be said.

Dongpo meat: 4.5 4️
The meat stew is very soft and tender, and it tastes sweet and salty.

I am not tofu 3.5 是️
Tofu is said to be made of stinky tofu, but there is no stinky tofu stinky and crispy and tender taste. It is more like a Hakka fried with stinky tofu.

Xo shrimp soy sauce 5虾️
A very special dish, which is very impressed with the taste, pushes it big

Yipin seafood tofu pot 3.5⭐️
Seafood materials are full of sincerity, but there are fewer tofu, and the taste is average

Fried ghost fried beef 3炒️
It will feel pretty salty if you do n’t match the rice, the taste is average

Ruanda Milk Emperor bag 3包️
The stuffing of the quicksand bag tastes very light, and I won't want to order it again.

"整體而言還是不錯的餐酒館。在台北要能生存不錯的餐酒館，除了要不錯吃、喝之外，店內風格有沒有梗可能也是能否存活的重點之一。看了恩熙俊介紹的影片後一直想來吃吃看。先講好的，門口有個扭轉乾坤小獅子，要扭轉一下祂才可以開門，有趣可愛，店內裝潢風格也頗有中式客棧的感覺，菜單的所有菜、酒名也都帶有中國風。

菜的部分，我們這次吃了「俺不是臭豆腐」很像客家小炒把豆乾換成了臭豆腐，有臭到，超級下飯，一致跟朋友認為好吃！「蒜香脆皮雞」需要先預訂，皮真的很脆，充滿蒜香，雞肉不柴也是下飯。「清炒水蓮」就是清炒水蓮。「川味水煮牛」我覺得不錯吃，算是偏辣，但該有的味道都有，也極度下飯，不吃辣的要跳過。

酒的部分，我們點了「龍飛鳳舞」酒符其名，用龍飛鳳舞的茶壺裝，拍照很美，但沒啥酒味。「青樓冰茶」長島冰茶高粱版，算是有點酒味，不難喝。「問卦」上面附個籤詩，拍照起來有趣，但真的很小杯，口味還行。店內發限動可換4杯「梅蘭芳shots」一致認為蠻好喝的，很像酸梅湯。

再來講有待加強的地方，桌子莫名的蠻髒的，好像很多輪沒擦過的感覺，我們有請店員再擦一次。蒜香脆皮雞、川味水煮牛，不知為何都沒有很燙。

雖然以上兩點都蠻中我地雷的，但莫名的吃得很開心，瑕不掩瑜，還是推薦喔！","Overall is a good restaurant.To be able to survive in Taipei, in addition to good food and drinking, whether there is a stalk in the store may be one of the focus of survival.After watching the video introduced by Enxijun, I always wanted to come and eat.Let's talk about it first. There is a small lion that reverses Qiankun at the door. You can open the door to reverse him. It is fun and cute. The interior decoration style of the store also feels a Chinese inn. All the dishes and wine names of the menu also have Chinese style.

For the dishes, this time we ate ""I am not stinky tofu"" very much like Hakka fried. The dried tofu was replaced with stinky tofu. It was stinky and super meals.""Garlic Crispy Skin Chicken"" needs to be booked first. The skin is really crispy and full of garlic.""Stir -fried Lotus"" is stir -fried lotus lotus.""Chuanwei boiled beef"" I think it is good to eat, it is spicy, but the taste should have it, and it is extremely meal.

In the wine part, we ordered the name of ""Dragon Feifeng Dance"". It was installed with the teapot of the dragon flying phoenix.""Blue Building Ice Tea"" Long Island Ice Tea Sorghum Edition is a bit of wine and not difficult to drink.""Ask the hexagram"" attached a poem, which is interesting to take pictures, but it is really a small cup and the taste is okay.The restrictions in the store can change 4 cups of ""Mei Lanfang SHOTS"" and agree that it is pretty good, much like sour plum soup.

In the case of it, there is a place to be strengthened. The table is inexplicable and dirty. It seems that many rounds have not been wiped. We ask the clerk to wipe it again.I don't know why it was not very hot.

Although the above two points are quite miles, I am inexplicably eating very well.",False
"📌裝潢美，餐點有特色又好吃，價位合理，但點心偏弱
第一次來門口讓人很容易錯過🤣🤣開門的方式非常有趣，要轉動石獅子才能開門。
🔸川味水煮牛
店員推薦招牌。花椒香氣很香，裡面的牛肉是薄肉片，肉比較老一點。比起牛肉，裏層的冬粉吸滿湯汁，非常好吃😋
🔸他不是臭豆腐
大推！很像客家小炒，但把豆乾換成臭豆腐。很搭！很香！很下飯！！
🔸花椒燒蛋
花椒味拿捏的很剛好。很像烘蛋那種綿綿的，卻吸收剛剛好的花椒肉汁，推！
🔸星洲辣子軟殼蟹
這個也很好吃！可以整隻直接吃，不需再剝殼。螃蟹炸得脆的剛剛好。
其他還有四季豆、炒水蓮，就安定的好吃。
有點炒飯，但可能是其他菜都太下飯了，白飯配菜就吃飽了。
甜點比較弱。點了流沙包跟馬蹄條。流沙包的外皮很乾。流沙也沒什麼鹹蛋黃味。馬蹄條內部甚至還是冰的。店家服務都很好，有重做也沒有收馬蹄條的錢。不過就不建議點甜點。
整體感受還是很好，店員耐心介紹餐點，也很積極收盤跟補水，給人的感覺很好。

裝潢不錯的新派川粵料理，菜單上可以明顯的看出粵菜和川菜的路數，第一次造訪時是因為有香港的朋友來台北，當然不好班門弄斧，所以點的全是川菜系，水煮牛肉用的火鍋薄片，底下墊有粉條，味道中規中矩，俺不是臭豆腐則是把臭豆腐炸過切條，取代豆腐乾炒成客家小炒，臭度有降低，味道還不錯，適合不喜歡那麼臭的朋友，糖醋排骨比較偏粵菜風，個人建議是排骨可以再處理得略為小塊一點，裹粉再稍微薄一點會更可口。用餐環境和服務都相當不錯。,"New-style Sichuan cuisine cuisine, the menu can significantly see Cantonese cuisine and Sichuan cuisine Road, when the first visit to make a visit because there are Hong Kong friends come to Taipei, of course, not the class xenor, so dot all Jeon Sichuan cuisine, water cookThe beef uses the hot pot thin slices, the bottom of the cushion has a powder, the taste in the rules, the unlikely stinky tofu fry the stinky tofu over the cut strip, replace the tofu fried into Hakka small fried, the smell is reduced, the taste is not good, suitable for dislike Qi Qi stinkFriends, sweet and sour ribs are more biased into Cantonese cuisine, personally suggest that ribs can be handled slightly smaller, baking powder is slightly thinner will be more tasty.The dining environment and service are quite good.",False
