"生日來吃！還好有選對餐廳！這家食物完全不雷，難得我選到不雷的餐廳⋯
我有再三確認過他的520活動⋯謝謝隱士集團的招待❤️
-
地段/
好像離捷運站滿近的，不過我們開車來，離摩天輪不遠的樣子，在台北時代廣場那邊。
裝潢/
感覺是很新的一家店，周遭的環境也很不錯～很漂亮很舒服很適合散步的地方
店內空間不太大，是長型的，燈光較暗，裝潢很像酒吧，不過是餐酒館，有吧台的位置，兩人座位多，另有八人跟六人位。
廁所很乾淨，還有附衛生棉！一百分！
服務/
店員不算太明顯的友善但非常細心！點餐有提醒我們可能點太多😂
需要什麼也很快來服務
最重要的是我們有掉筷子，馬上補上一雙，真的太讚🥰
食物/
真的是驚艷！
一開始上的是明太子烤雞肉串、椒麻雞、文蛤，三道菜都很好吃！尤其明太子烤雞肉串真的經驗！
後來上的冷筍也好吃！非常清爽
麻油鮮蝦豬肉麵也很香，不過麵是家常麵那種比較粗的麵
雞軟骨炸的很棒；茄子料理的有點看不懂，而且有點鹹，但新鮮；鹹豬肉也不錯，切得很薄；薯條感覺是整顆馬鈴薯下去切細的；蒸蛋超棒，喜歡魚子醬的一定要點🥰好好吃！
豆腐也不錯～雞湯微貴，只有一小盅，一隻雞腿，但還不錯；紅豆湯偏甜。
我們吃完了這些，真的超飽～～～
氣氛/
像是供餐供的很棒很精緻而且可以吃正餐的酒吧哈哈哈，也可以看球賽，慢慢吃慢慢喝酒感覺很讚。而且人不多～
整體/
絕對會回訪～
下次可能去別家分店，但這裡真的很舒服，吃飽散步超級適合～
我們花了5775哈哈哈","Eat birthday!Fortunately, there are right restaurants!This food is completely unscrupulous, it is rare to choose a dimer restaurant ...
I have repeatedly confirmed his 520 activity ... Thank you in the hospitality of the Hermit Group ❤️
-
Location/
It seems to be close to the MRT station, but we drive, not far from the Ferris wheel, in the Taipei Times Square.
Decoration/
It feels like a new shop, and the surrounding environment is also very good ~ It's beautiful and comfortable, very suitable for walking.
The space in the shop is not too large, it is long, the lights are darker, the decoration is very much like a bar, but it is a dining tavern. There is a place in the bar.
The toilet is very clean, and there are sanitary cotton!One hundred points!
Serve/
The clerk is not too obvious but very careful!Ordering is reminding us to order too much 点
Need to serve quickly
The most important thing is that we have chopsticks, and immediately make up for a pair.
food/
It's really amazing!
At the beginning, it was the skewers, pepper chicken, and clams, and the three dishes were delicious!Especially the real experience of the prince's roast chicken skewers!
Later, the cold bamboo shoots were also delicious!Very refreshing
The noodles of sesame oil fresh shrimp pork are also very fragrant, but the noodles are the thick noodles of the family noodles
Chicken cartilage fried is great; eggplant cuisine is a bit unspeakable, and it is a bit salty, but fresh; salted pork is also good and thin; the fries feels like the whole potato is cut and cut thin; The caviar must be delicious!
Tofu is also good ~ Chicken soup is slightly expensive, only a small cup, a chicken leg, but not bad; the red bean soup is sweet.
We have finished eating this, it is really full ~~~
atmosphere/
Like a bar that is great and delicate and can eat dinner hahaha, you can also watch the game. It feels great to eat slowly and drinking slowly.And there are not many people ~
overall/
Absolutely return to visit ~
I may go to other branches next time, but it is really comfortable here.
We spent 5775 hahaha"

"非常喜歡，酒很好喝。

周五晚上臨時跟朋友約，沒想到還餐廳還有位子，我想是週末的時候大家都會趕快從大直逃走，避免塞車。

當天點的所有餐點我們都覺得很好吃，鰻魚飯、手工豬肉麵、明太子山藥、挑嘴三寶（麻辣鴨血豆腐）、羊肉串。唯一覺得不用點的是烤茄子，有點苦苦的。

酒類大推他各種梅子酒，我們試了大約四種，都各有特色，而且完全不會過甜。

服務生服務都滿即時的，除了當天不知道為什麼有位女服務生臉滿臭，但瑕不掩瑜，仍然非常推薦這家。店內空間不大，還是建議要先訂位。","I like it very much, the wine is delicious.

On Friday night, I made an appointment with my friends. I didn't expect to return the restaurant and there was a seat. I think that everyone would escape from Dazhi on the weekend to avoid traffic jams.

We all feel delicious at all meals that day, eel rice, handmade pork noodles, Ming prince yam, picking up three treasures (spicy duck blood tofu), lamb skewers.The only thing I do n’t think is to bake eggplant is a bit bitter.

The wine pushes him various plum wines. We tried about four types, each has its own characteristics, and it will not be too sweet at all.

The waiter's services are full of instant. Except for the fact that a female waiter was full of smell that day, but the flaws were still recommended.The space in the store is not large, it is recommended to book a place first."
"蠻低調的一間店，佈置還不錯，訂價偏高，串燒是主打但烤的不好(可能因為肉太薄所以烤老了)，炸魷魚(380）金沙很香榮登今日最推薦，調酒普通沒特別記憶點，兩個女店員服務態度都很好，慶生招待一瓶酒是今天最開心的部分，加入會員有好吃的胡麻冰淇淋，整桌都打卡五顆星的話會招待牛蒡。

整理照片發現明太子雞肉(240)菜單上寫三串結果只來兩串，是變相漲價嗎😂
干貝(七顆420）烤老了有點可惜。
蔥鹽牛約克(兩串280）今天沒了換成橫隔膜，調味還不錯，但烤太老只好貢獻給牙口好的朋友吃了。另外廁所很貼心的準備了漱口水跟牙線(這個值得鼓勵)。

因為份量不多，吃完覺得肚子還有點餓，但晚上就少吃點養身囉😆","A low -key shop, the layout is not bad, the price is high, and the skewers are the main but not baked (maybe because the meat is too thin, so it is grilled and old). There is no special memory point for bartending. The service attitude of the two female clerks is very good. A bottle of wine is the happiest part of today. Bulls.

Sort the photos and find that three strings of three strings of the Ming Prince Chicken (240) menu only come to two skewers. Is it a price increase?
It is a pity that it is a pity that it is old.
Onion and salt Niu Ying (two skewers 280) did not change to the diaphragm today. The seasoning was not bad, but the baking was too old to contribute to friends with good teeth.In addition, the toilet is very intimately prepared to rinse mouth and dental floss (this is worth encouraging).

Because the portion is not much, I feel a little hungry after eating, but I eat less in the evening."
"食物真的超級好吃～狂推我們每一道點的菜（其實根本不知遇到什麼是超人氣的，我愛吃什麼看順眼就點），完全沒有讓我失望！
酒就真的少了點，若有日式清酒🍶會更棒！
這裡很棒，推薦給內湖大直下班的人可以來！","The food is really super delicious ~ I push every order of our dishes (in fact, I do n’t know what is super popular, I like what I like to eat), I do n’t let me down at all!
There is really a little less wine.
It is great here. People who are recommended to Nidi Dazhi can come!"
"一顆星扣水杯缺角差點刮到嘴
一顆星扣難以忍受的出餐速度。
第一輪18：00入座的客人，到19：00才出兩道菜。
餐點倒是好吃。","The scarcity of a water cup is almost scraped to the mouth
An unbearable meal speed.
The first round of the guests at 18:00 will only release two dishes until 19:00.
The meal is delicious."
"餐食好吃
用餐環境不錯
就是位子稍少
當天是坐吧臺用餐
覺得是不錯的下班來一杯的店
明太子雞肉串 必點！！
飲品也很好喝喔","Delicious meals
The dining environment is good
Just a little bit less
On the day, I was sitting on the bar to dine
I think it's a good shop to come from get off work
The Chicken Chicken Skewers must be ordered!Intersection
The drink is also very delicious"
四店裝潢回歸正常，一樓有沙發區、雙人座和吧台，二樓則是日式風格團體座位。餐點味道都不錯，服務人員對於餐點的介紹很清楚，酒類的特性也能掌握，服務也貼心。目前去過隱士、隱寺和隱侍，隱侍個人認為隱侍最優,"The decoration of the four shops returns to normal. The first floor has a sofa area, a double seat and bar, and the second floor is a Japanese -style group seat.The taste of the meal is good, the service staff is very clear about the meal, the characteristics of the wine can be mastered, and the service is intimate.I have been to the hermit, Yin Temple, and Hidden Sales. Hidden people personally think that the hidden service is the best"
"餐點價格偏高 不過還算好吃～那個金沙透抽 還有山豬肉片不錯 其他較缺乏亮點
調酒單價也是偏高 酒有點淡 國色天香還不錯
梅酒很普！

三個人這次吃約近5000
一半價格是酒品
酒方面cp 值不是很高..","The price of meals is high, but it is still delicious ~ That Sand Sands and Pork Slices are good. Other lack of highlights
The price of bartending is also high. The wine is a bit light.
Plum wine is very universal!

Three people eat about 5000 this time
Half of the price is wine
The CP value in the wine is not very high .."
"餐點中規中矩，飲料與調酒很普通。

份量可以，五個人今天吃了六千多，吃完沒有那種覺得今天很滿足可以打道回府的感覺
後來還要去吃台灣第一鹹酥雞

總共點了美式玉子燒、金沙套圈圈、酥炸雞軟骨、莎莎扒肥腸、雪中天使炒烏冬、紙包辣考土雞飯（中辣）、炊煙烤物盤、真的綠袖蓮、烤季節蔬食、黑蒜香菇雞，
飲料點了三杯酒跟兩杯無酒精飲料

招待是蘿蔔片與五個shot(裡面有兩杯是蘋果汁）

唯一吃了覺得很驚艷的是美式玉子燒，其他的都是市民大道上生意不差的居家屋可以做出來的味道。
雖然是走日式風格，但調味很西方、歌單很台灣，聽的都是梁靜茹五月天周杰倫哈哈哈

與期待最不符的是黑蒜香菇雞湯
真的是很小一盅，用黑蒜熬製味道很濃郁
但因為真的太小一碗了不是大家可以分的量，所以比較不推薦

比較是吃裝潢的

提供大家參考","The meal is quite satisfactory, and drinks and bartending are ordinary.

The portion is okay. Five people have eaten more than 6,000 today. After eating, there is no feeling that I can return to the house today.
Later, I went to eat the first salty crispy chicken in Taiwan

A total of American -style jade roasted, jinsha set circles, crispy fried chicken cartilage, Sasha chop fat intestines, the angel fried Udry in the snow, spicy chicken rice (spicy), cooked smoke grilled plate, real green sleeve lotus , Baked season vegetables, black mushrooms, chicken,
The drink ordered three glasses of wine and two cups of alcoholic drinks

The hospitality is radishes and five shots (there are two cups in it are apple juice)

The only thing that I felt amazing was American Yoko, and the others were the taste that the home house where business on the citizen's avenue was not bad.
Although it is a Japanese style, the seasoning is very Western and the song list is very Taiwan.

The most inconsistent with expectation is the black garlic shiitake mushroom chicken soup
It's really a small cup, and the taste of black garlic is very strong
But because it ’s too small, it’ s not the amount that everyone can divide, so it is not recommended.

Compared with decoration

Provide your reference"
"適合多人聚餐
兩人點那麼多吃到剩下一道已經極限
酒類選擇還算多
最喜歡雞軟骨和豆腐～
這次都沒吃到主食很可惜","Suitable for multi -person dinner
Two people order so much to eat the remaining one, the remaining one is already the limit
There are so many wine selection
Favorite chicken cartilage and tofu ~
It's a pity not to eat the staple food this time"
"大直大區少數有開到半夜的餐廳
半夜想聚餐的話基本上是最好的選擇
只是座位不多，最好提早訂位

餐點價格高昂
但是十分美味
就算是果汁也跟一般果汁店賣的喝起來不同
主食料理的量不少
可以三四個人分著吃
是一個值得多來的餐酒館

半夜來的話交通算是很方便
晚上的內湖幾乎沒有人
路邊停車格非常多
不用擔心找不到停車位","There are a few restaurants in the midnight in Dazhi District
If you want to dinner in the middle of the night, it is basically the best choice
It's just that there are not many seats, it's best to order early

The price of meals is high
But very delicious
Even if it is fruit juice, it is different from the general fruit juice shop.
There are many staple foods
You can eat three or four people
It is a meal tavern worth more

If you come in the middle of the night, the traffic calculation is very convenient
There are almost no one in Neihu at night
There are a lot of parking grids on the roadside
Don't worry, you can't find a parking space"

"要在這點餐吃到飽
平均一個人要花1000～1500左右
今天聚餐吃了很多道
覺得串燒沒有特別讓人驚豔
最好吃的是金沙中卷跟炸牛蒡
中卷調味適中趁熱吃很香
炸牛蒡一盤不夠，點第二盤還十分鐘掃光
又酥又香太好吃了😋","Want to eat at this meal
On average, it takes about 1000 to 1500
I ate a lot today
I think skewers are not particularly amazing
The best thing is that the golden sand roll and the fried beef gruel
The middle roll seasoning is moderate, and it is very fragrant while it is hot.
The fried beef gangsters are not enough, and the second set is still in ten minutes to sweep the light
It's crispy and fragrant."

鹹豬肉處理的很讚 油脂的部分很有彈性

特調的醬汁酸甜涮嘴
洋蔥的嗆 蒜酥的辣豐富更多層次

明太子滿滿的鋪在山藥上
山藥脆口 帶有些微黏性
明太子烤的鮮美 也不會過鹹
起司的乳香增添溫和的調性 很是美味

雪中天使炒烏冬是意外有趣的一盤

串烤的表現都不錯
雞皮烤的酥脆 搭配綿密馬鈴薯泥
口感矛盾卻又柔和舒服

肥腸搭配莎莎醬也是一絕

The spicy and richness of the onion is more and more popular

Prince Ming is full of yam on the yam
The yam is crispy with some slight stickiness
The freshness of the Ming Dynasty is not too salty
The fragrance of the cheese adds mild tones very delicious

Angel fried Udin in the snow is an unexpected and interesting plate
Snow red fried seafood oolong noodles with fried pork chops
Fundamental pork chop fundamental fried coffee coffee, tender and juicy

The performance of skewers is good
Crispy chicken skin is crispy with dense potato puree
The taste is contradictory but soft and comfortable

"店裡防疫態度非常糟，調酒師們邊喝酒調酒邊聊天，大概十分鐘內就又會倒下一杯酒給對方，重點是講話咳嗽沒戴口罩，如果簡單喝完就戴口罩我可以接受，但是喝完酒口罩就戴在下巴，位子剛好又在吧檯，還有呼吸道症狀！！覺得神扯！！

整體價位不低，松阪牛很還好，干貝加的配料有點腥，雞肉料理和烏龍麵ok，但下次我寧願吃美福飯店的義式餐廳，起碼服務好，防疫工作也做得好！

本來只想給一顆星，看在送餐人員妹妹滿積極的情況多給一顆星。
評論4.9，推論應該是打卡五星評論送牛蒡！","The epidemic prevention attitude in the store is very bad. The bartender chat with wine while drinking, and will pour a glass of wine for the other party in about ten minutes. The point is to talk about cough and do not wear masks. If you wear a mask after simple drinking, I can accept it. , But after drinking the wine mask, wear the chin, the seat happens to be on the bar, and the respiratory symptoms!IntersectionFeel God!Intersection

The overall price is not low. Matsusaka Niu is very good. The ingredients of the shellfish are a bit fishy. Chicken dishes and oolong noodles are OK, but next time I would rather eat the Italian restaurant of the Meifu Hotel, at least the service, the epidemic prevention work is well done well Intersection

Originally, I just wanted to give a star and see a star in the active situation of the food delivery staff.
Comment 4.9, the inference should be to punch a five -star comment to send cattle!"
"隱系列餐酒館不會讓人失望😊
吮指脆牛蒡超好吃！
嗜食如鮭黑嘴飯，微辣香香超好吃！ …","The hidden series and tavern will not disappoint 😊 😊 😊 😊 😊
Finger sucking crispy bull is super delicious!
Eating food like salmon black mouth rice, slightly spicy fragrance is super delicious!Mowing"
"「隱侍 The Samurai Bistro」，不是居酒屋，而是結合日式餐點與酒吧的餐酒館。

這裡本該是好友歡聚、把妹搭訕的夜店，但在滿滿日本元素下，客人們都自制起來。沒有酒臭、沒有煙味，只有店員與客人打成一片的歡笑聲。餐點高雅美味，價格實惠。在日式傳統風格下，時而混合韓式、美式，碰撞出驚艷的味道，山海關蒸蛋、地藏天婦羅、紙包辣烤土雞飯都是令人回味再三的佳餚。謎轆小章魚、炙干貝蟹黃盅等日式小菜也都是用料豪氣，鮮甜唰嘴。店員還贈送我們生蠔，新鮮無腥味，真正的海底牛奶。

我們在居酒屋向來不點酒。面對這等奧客，美麗的小姐姐幫我們精挑細選兩款氣味獨特的低濃度酒嚐鮮，還請調酒師調了無酒精的「來自天堂」，真的非常窩心。

半夜肚子餓睡不著？來隱侍邂逅美食、美酒、和美女吧！","""The Samurai Bistro"" is not a izakaya, but a restaurant that combines Japanese -style meals and bars.

This is the nightclub where friends gathered together and talked about the girl, but under the full Japanese elements, the guests made themselves.There is no smell of wine and no smoke, and only the clerk and the guests make a laugh.The meal is elegant and beautiful, and the price is affordable.Under the traditional Japanese style, it is sometimes mixed with Korean and American style. It collides with amazing taste. Shanhaiguan steamed eggs, Tibetan tempura, and spicy roasted chicken rice in Shanhaiguan are all remarkable dishes.Japanese -style small dishes such as the mystery of the little octopus, the dried scallion crab yellow cup are also rich in ingredients, fresh and sweet.The clerk also presented us oysters, fresh and fishy, ​​real underwater milk.

We have never ordered alcohol in izakaya.Faced with these Olympic guests, the beautiful lady helped us carefully select two unique low concentrations of wine, and asked the bartender to adjust the alcohol -free ""from heaven"".

Can't sleep in the middle of the night?Come and serve food, wine, and beautiful women!"

Chicken bone is crispy and slightly spicy, and the slightly sourly sour sauce next to the wine is just right"
"每一項餐點都很好吃，沒有雷，而且份量也很足夠，推薦聚餐或是約會可以前來，酒也好喝不踩雷👍👍👍
唯一缺點就是定價高…扣一顆星","Each meal is delicious, there is no thunder, and the portion is sufficient. It is recommended that dinner or dating can come.
The only disadvantage is the high pricing ... deduct a star"
"店內氣氛選歌不符、店員自顧自己聊天影響客人、餐點口味較特別也沒有事先跟客人講解內容物、份量點餐時也沒有建議大概是幾人份。
價錢過高cp 值很低，不推薦。
唯一只有蒸蛋覺得食材很多樣化很棒。","The atmosphere of the atmosphere in the store does not match the song, the clerk's self -care to chat affects the guests, and the taste of the meal is more special and did not explain to the guests in advance to explain the content of the content or order.
The price is too high, the CP value is very low, and it is not recommended.
The only steamed egg feels that the ingredients are sampled."
調酒是一種小清新～章魚口感層次豐富很有誠意，如果芥末再多一點會更喜歡。烤蔬菜好吃～服務親切，值得回訪,"Sake sake, a kind of small freshness ~ octopus rich layers of richness is very sincere, if the mustard a little more will be more like.Grilled vegetables delicious ~ friendly service, worth returning"

"餐點變化少,菜色固定
食物算美味,但不適合小朋友
低消每人800
大樓空調壞了未修好,室內溫度30度,
許多人吃不下只能打包外帶
訂位時未告知空調問題,到現場詢問才主動告知","The meal changes less, and the dishes are fixed
The food is delicious, but it is not suitable for children
Low eliminate 800 per person
The building's air conditioner is broken and it is not repaired. The indoor temperature is 30 degrees.

"餐點都很好吃很有特色
尤其是生蠔，超級推！超級新鮮！
還會付一個whisky shot","The meals are delicious and distinctive
Especially oysters, super push!Super fresh!
Also pay a whisky shot"
餐點跟調酒都在水準之上 重點在於國旗小姊姊的四杯shot有如畫龍點睛般 讓整個用餐情境又提高了一個水平！,The focus of meals and bartender is that the four cups of SHOTs of the national flag sister's four cups of sisters are as finishing as the first dining situation!
座位不多，調酒好喝，食物不錯吃，當天剛好有足球比賽，整體氣氛不錯。,"There are not many seats, the bartending is delicious, the food is good, and the food is just on the same day. The overall atmosphere is good."
"夜深人靜

"菜肉盤中飧跟杏仁豆腐芝麻沙拉很好吃，調酒也很好喝，但是上菜速度有點慢

"餐點都很有特色，店員熱情。
可惜不是本人喜好的口味路線。","The meals are very distinctive, and the clerk is enthusiastic.
Unfortunately, it is not the taste route I like."

歡樂輕鬆的時光，調酒讓人驚艷是一定要的，至於料理更是讓人覺得非常物超所值,"The joyful time, the bartending is amazing, it is necessary to make people feel worthwhile."
"2022/11/12
食物非常好吃，餐點分量大約3-4人，座位偏少。","2022/11/12
The food is very delicious. The meals are about 3-4 people, and the seats are small."
試營運與朋友來聚餐嚐鮮，順便玩交換禮物，整體表現還不錯，紙包辣雞飯，烤串拼盤都有一定水準，海鮮也新鮮！店長會時不時準備一些特調shot來與大家互動，二樓場地滿大的，10人內聚餐一大桌可以輕鬆安排🤝吃的太開心都忘記拍食物跟酒了😂,"Trial operations with friends to dinner, and by the way, play exchange gifts. The overall performance is not bad. Paper bag spicy chicken rice and skewers have a certain level, and seafood is also fresh!From time to time, the store manager will prepare some special SHOT to interact with you. The second floor is full. A large table of dinner in 10 people can easily arrange for food."
本以為在大直這麼多優質餐廳的地方不會踩到雷，結果這家真的讓人大失所望，點了好幾樣菜全都不好吃，串燒又乾又硬，筋很多，海鮮有腥味，連很簡單的烤雞腿都又柴又乾，網路介紹看起來很不錯，結果真的很不會煮，高價位，低品質，回頭率零。,"I thought it would not step on the thunder in so many high -quality restaurants in Dazhi. As a result, this one was really disappointing. I ordered several dishes to be delicious. The skewers were dry and hard. Even the very simple roast chicken legs are dry and dry. The introduction of the Internet looks very good. As a result, it is really not cooked, high -priced, low -quality, zero -rate rate."
餐點好吃，但上的有點太快，酒好喝，環境乾淨,"The meal is delicious, but the ones are a bit too fast, the wine is delicious, the environment is clean"

餐點味道豐富，環境舒適，適合小酌一下的地方。,"The meals are rich in taste, comfortable environment, suitable for a drink."
與家人一起前往吃慶生餐，每樣餐點都水準之上。推薦美式玉子燒，醬汁和裡面的料都很特別。雪中天使炒烏冬也很好吃，不過烏龍麵實在太少了🤣，裡面都是滿滿滿的料，太豐富了。 …,"Go to the birthday meal with your family, and every meal is above the standard.It is recommended to be American -style jade, and the sauce and the ingredients are very special.The angels in the snow are also delicious, but the oolong noodles are too few, and the inside is full of materials, which is too rich.Mowing"

好煩喔才來十次而已，每次來都一直請我吃東西喝東西！還能不給五星好評嗎！,"It's so annoying that I only come ten times. Every time I come, I always invite me to eat and drink!Can you not give five stars!"

服務真的不行✋🏽
點茶碗蒸 上了沒給湯匙

星星都被服務扣光光了
感覺禮拜天晚上吃 他們可能想下班了吧😒","Ordinary meals
The atmosphere is okay
Is roasted eggplant a bit bitter?Intersection
These are all fine

The service is really not available ✋🏽
Steam on the tea bowl and didn’t give a spoon without a spoon
I ordered the chicken soup and didn’t give a cup
Don't you understand that this is a buffet?

The stars are all deducted by the service
Feeling that they eat at night, they may want to get off work."
燈光美氣氛佳，約會的好地方,"The lights are beautiful, and a good place for dating"
原以為是剛開店20min冷氣不涼，看了G評論結果根本是冷氣一直有問題，超熱。店內音樂跟店內氛圍不太符合，上菜也沒好好介紹菜品與介紹份量，海鮮食材有點腥，調酒飲料漂亮但味道很普通。不符合晚餐低消800的水準。,"I thought it was just 20 minutes of air -conditioned air -conditioning. After watching the G comments, the result was that there was always a problem with air -conditioning.The music in the store is not in line with the atmosphere in the store, and the food is not well introduced to the food and the amount of introduction. The seafood ingredients are a bit fishy.Does not meet the level of 800 dinner."
服務跟食物、酒類都讓我好驚豔，會常來❤️,"The service and food and wine are amazing, I will come often ❤️"
東西好吃，員工好正😘 …,"The things are delicious, the employees are so good ..."
"食物非常讓人失望，cp值奇低無比。算是典型的要做創意料理，結果只有驚嚇沒有驚喜。一顆星給飲品，如果只是要來喝酒的應該還可以。

食材品質很差：420元的干貝吃起來像中式自助餐的品質（咀嚼起來有塑膠感的那種干貝），鰻魚飯的飯竟然是番茄醬炒飯。烤物點了牛包蝦、焦糖脆雞皮，和豬肉串，先不說焦糖不是炙燒糖粒而是焦糖醬擺盤、脆的不是雞皮是雞皮上面的花生，所有肉質都是有騷味的等級，能夠在台灣吃到會騷的豬肉真的很少見。

店內氣氛看人喜好，音樂很大聲、環境吸音效果不如何、店裡面很暗、不涼，整體有ㄧ種在夜店包廂裡面的感覺。一餐花下來兩個人也要2300（一人低消800），建議不要把這家當晚餐吃。","The food is very disappointing, and the CP value is extremely strange.It is typical to make creative dishes.A star for drinks, if you just want to drink, you should be fine.

The quality of the ingredients is very poor: 420 yuan scallop is like the quality of Chinese buffets (the kind of scallops with a plastic feeling), and the rice of eel rice is tomato sauce fried rice.The roasted items ordered the beef bag shrimp, caramel crispy chicken skin, and pork skewers. The grade of savage flavor is really rare to eat pork in Taiwan.

The atmosphere in the store is good at people, the music is very loud, the environmental sound absorption effect is not much, and the store is dark and not cold. The overall feels in the nightclub box.After a meal, two people also need 2,300 (one person eliminates 800). It is recommended not to eat this home for dinner."
沒冷氣，很不舒服的用餐經驗，看了評論之後覺得冷氣的問題可以這麼久不處理難道要等冬天來臨。也因為空調問題，草草結束用餐，實在是不想多待在這空間。餐點的口味很特殊，建議每一項都跟服務生確認過作法再點。小章魚有腥味，加上吃起來臭臭的，吃了一口之後沒有人再去動過它；七里香吃到有發酸的味道，320元的蒸蛋不如改名成茶碗蒸還比較貼切。認真建議第二輪喝過酒，味覺已經麻痺再來。,"Without air -conditioning, I have a very uncomfortable dining experience. After reading the comments, I feel that the problem of air -conditioning can not deal with it for so long. Do you have to wait for winter.Because of the problem of air -conditioning, hastily finished dining, I really don't want to stay in this space.The taste of the meal is very special. It is recommended that each item confirmed that the method is confirmed.The small octopus has a fishy smell, and it tastes stinky. After taking a bite, no one moves it again; Qili Xiang eats a sour taste. The steamed egg of 320 yuan is not as steamed as a tea bowl steaming.It is recommended to drink in the second round, and the taste has been paralyzed."
好吃超值，店員親切，燈光優美氣氛佳😍,"It's delicious, the clerk is kind, and the beautiful light atmosphere is good 😍"
"服務還不錯，料理有特色，不過精緻度差一點。適合喝酒放鬆，但餐食就還好。
炙干貝蟹黃的干貝就是正常大小的干貝，照片都特寫所以看起來很大😂","The service is not bad.Suitable for drinking and relaxation, but meals are fine.
The scallion crab crab yellow scallops are normally size scallops, and the photos are close -up, so it looks very big."
"年前跟朋友續攤想試試這裡的餐跟調酒
結果
食物超鹹~連照片也不想拍
只有調酒還可以
我們約12點進去
但接待的服務人員態度不是很積極
問他餐點，調酒的問題，有些要回不回的
不推
明明營業到凌晨3點
但卻不是很想接待客人
這樣...幹嘛營業到3點","I want to try the meals and bartending here with friends from my friends.
result
The food is super salty ~ I don’t even want to take photos
Only alcoholic
We go in at about 12 o'clock
But the attitude of the reception service staff is not very active
Ask him meals, the question of bartender, some need to be back to
Not push
Obviously open until 3 am
But I don't really want to receive guests
So ... why open at 3 o'clock"
環境好 還不錯～,The environment is good and pretty ~
"給兩星是因為烏龍麵牛排沾麵好吃，調酒一般，烤物拼盤一般般，烤的蠻油的，盤子都是油
最令人不解的是我以為隱侍是一個安靜地餐酒館，居然被店員跟其他客人弄得像夜店KTV 一樣，讓人傻眼
東西好吃也蓋不過去，體驗很差
建議不喜喧鬧的客人別來這間，不會再訪","The two stars are because the oolong steak is delicious, the bartender is general, the grilled object is general, the baked is oily, the plates are all oil
The most puzzling thing is that I think that the hidden waiter is a quiet dining tavern. It is actually dumbfounded like a nightclub KTV by the clerk.
The things can not be covered with delicious food, and the experience is poor
It is recommended that you don’t come here if you don’t like the noisy."
"230210 Friday Night

看似高級居酒屋，可惜硬軟體都不到位，餐廳不大，但冷氣卻不冷，鄰桌人員聊天內容聽得一清二楚，服務人員態度意興闌珊，比起和客人交流，更喜歡和同事聊天，即使用餐當天坐在吧台區，吧台人員除了確認餐點之外，沒有任何交流。餐點選擇不算多，酒類更是讓人失望，日本酒或是紅白酒調酒選擇都不多，點了兩杯就決定不再加點，餐點內容也是乏善可陳，質量口味都不符餐廳定位，不夠精緻，不夠便宜，份量也不大，價格又不便宜，不上不下的食物品質，讓人苦惱到底這是一家什麼樣的店，既不能開懷暢飲，大口吃肉大口喝酒，也吃不出烹煮食物的用心，燒烤拼盤多數又乾又柴，湯品份量小又重鹹，價格也高，現場裝潢和用餐氣氛也非常普通，整體實在讓我想不出再訪的理由。,"It seems to be a high -end izakaya, but unfortunately the hard software is not in place, the restaurant is not large, but the air -conditioning is not cold. The content of the neighboring staff can listen clearly. Even if you sit in the bar area on the day of the meal, there is no communication except for confirming the meal.There are not many choices for meals, and the wine is disappointing. There are not many choices for Japanese wine or red and white wine. I decided not to add some more after ordering two cups. The content of the meal is also lacking. Not exquisite enough, not cheap enough, the portion is not large, the price is not cheap. The intention of cooking food, most of the barbecue platter is dry and firewood, the soup is small and salty, the price is also high, and the on -site decoration and dining atmosphere are also very ordinary. The overall makes me unable to visit the reasons for re -visits."
東西精緻好吃又新鮮,"Exquisite, delicious and fresh"
"酒好喝東西好吃
但就是基本上沒冷氣真的受不了
除了冷氣外其他都很讚
請店家注意一下真的”太熱了”","Wine delicious food delicious

棒棒喔！別忘了你口袋的禮物！,Best!Don't forget your pocket gift!
真的都靠寫手 食物普普 小姐臉也不知道在臭什麼 蒸蛋也沒給湯匙 基本的常識都沒有 比起其他居酒屋（吳留手）餐酒館（艾朋）差的不只一點的距離,"Really relying on the writer and food, Miss Pup's face does not know what steamed eggs are not giving the spoon and the basic common sense. Not only the distance is not only a little bit worse than other izakaya (Wu Lishou) restaurant (Ai Peng)."

外場服務態度非常差，一進店就反应座位太小要換坐，回覆2F沒開放無法換，後沙發区有人離場再次要求換座，回覆巳有人预訂，已經2亇多小時未有人入座，非常糟的体驗,"The service attitude of the outside field is very poor. As soon as you enter the store, the seat is too small to change the seat. Reply to the 2F that it is not open and cannot be changed. Someone in the back sofa area leaves the field and asked to change the seat again. Very bad experience"
名符其實的隱侍，門面低調招牌字小小的真不容易發現。走進和風的門迎面是現代風格的調酒吧台，菜式也是日式混搭西式，串烤羊肋條上抹的是青醬，半生熟鮭魚蓋在墨魚燉飯上，玉子燒吃起來像歐姆蛋…不知道在吃哪國菜但是好吃就好。炙干貝蟹黃的干貝新鮮又大顆，炙燒半熟夾著蟹黃更加鮮甜。喉嚨借生蠔過先擠一點檸檬汁再淋一半的Whisky在生蠔上，讓酒和檸檬汁帶出生蠔的香氣再細細品嚐飽滿的蠔肉，大推！,"The actual hidden waiter, the low -key signature characters on the facade are not easy to find.Walking into the door of Hefeng is a modern bartending bar. The dishes are also Japanese -style mixes and western -style. The baked sheep ribs are covered with green sauce. Half -life cooked salmon is covered on cuttlefish stewed rice. … I don't know which country food is eating but delicious.The dried shellfish dried scallop crab is fresh and large, and the burning is half -cooked with crab yellow.The throat borrows oysters to squeeze a little lemon juice and half of the whity on the oysters, so that the aroma of the wine and lemon juice with the aroma of the birth of the oysters will be carefully tasted, and push it!"

一個喝點東西、吃點東西的好地方。價格不太友好，如果一起去的話可能要花很多錢。儘管如此，雞尾酒還是不錯的，不太濃，菜餚也很美味。菜的份量不算大。我相信2-3人是分享訂購的所有東西的最佳團體。辣烤雞比賽真的很辣，只有當你喜歡辣的時候才可以嘗試一下。 （但我仍然喜歡這些口味！）在辛苦工作一天后，絕對值得與一些人一起嘗試！,"A good place to drink something and eat something.The price is not friendly, and it may cost a lot of money if you go together.Nevertheless, cocktails are still good, not too strong, and the dishes are delicious.The amount of dishes is not large.I believe 2-3 people are the best groups to share everything.The spicy grilled chicken game is really spicy, you can try it only when you like spicy.(But I still like these flavors!) After working hard for a day, it is definitely worth trying with some people!"
相當大的一部分，令我驚訝。食物很棒而且服務也很好。裝飾很漂亮，但燈光有點暗。,"The quite large part surprised me.The food is great and the service is good.The decoration is beautiful, but the lights are a bit dark."
