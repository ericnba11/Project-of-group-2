"2019/3/9 中午用餐

在2018雅室牛排遷址之後，原團隊出走創立了這家新概念牛排館
氣氛、服務、餐點皆為一流

*餐點*
美國肋眼老饕牛排：店家說是最嫩的肉，但是我認為跟菲力吃起來好像是差不多的，而且OZ偏少一點

大紅屋菲力紐約客牛排：雙人套餐之一，每人可享用菲力及紐約客兩個部位的肉。菲力吃起來比老饕還要軟嫩、紐約客則是帶點嚼勁。我很推這道主菜~因為可以同時吃到兩個部位

Ps.牛排都建議點三分熟～

鮮活加拿大龍蝦：這龍蝦不小隻!(比教父牛排的還要大!!) 口感很鮮甜，而且分量也很有誠意! 建議可以兩人共享一隻

澎湖大明蝦：這道開胃菜很特別，蝦子是用核桃木去烤的，端上來的時候有種薰香。而且附的蝦餅也好吃

環境：氣氛不錯、座位之間不會相離太近，服務生動作很俐落。

總結：是個適合來約會或是跟好友聚餐的好店","2019/3/9 lunch dinner

After the 2018 Yauro steak relocation, the original team found out this new concept steak hall
Atmosphere, service, and meals are first -class

*Meal*
American rib eye steak: The store said it is the tendence of meat, but I think it seems similar to Feili, and OZ is a bit less

Dahongwu Fili New York Steak: One of the two -person set meal, each can enjoy the meat in the two parts of Feili and New York guests.Fili eats softer and tender than the old lady, and New Yorkers are chewy.I push this main dish ~ Because I can eat two parts at the same time

PS. Steak is recommended to order three cooked ~

Fresh Canadian lobster: This lobster is not small! (More than the godfather steak !!) The taste is very sweet, and the weight is very sincere! It is recommended that two people can share one of one

Penghu Emerald shrimp: This appetizer is very special. The shrimp is roasted with walnut wood. When it comes up, there is a kind of incense.And the attached shrimp cake is delicious

Environment: The atmosphere is good, the seats will not be too close, and the waiter's movement is very neat.

Summary: Is a good shop suitable for dating or dinner with friends"
"四顆星
整體的用餐經驗比雅室來的好
空間舒適寬敞
餐點美味
服務親切
不過當天自己帶紅酒開瓶費500
但店家沒有準備冰桶 是小小缺點

202204抱著中山店美好的回憶
前往新店址內湖店用餐

空間狹小 感覺坐在走道上
離大門口很近 風超大
不管是空調的風 還是門一打開灌進來的風
完全的干擾客人 讓人很不舒適

服務不行❌
進門該有的招呼
用餐中間的桌面整理
都沒有

餐點
招牌龍蝦就是水煮吧？沒有調味
蝦膏有股腥味
有附上洗手盅算加分

肋眼，經過比較是本日尚可的餐點

本日精選牛排
端上來傻眼
看起來像便當裡的牛肉片
這個不能稱為牛排吧！？

沙拉表現可以
湯和甜點 失望😮‍💨

價位不便宜
餐點、服務、用餐環境
完全跟不上應該有的品質

不會再訪","Four stars
The overall meal experience is better than the Ya room
Space comfortable and spacious
Delicious meals
Intimate service
But that day, the bottle opening fee of red wine 500
But the store is not ready to prepare ice buckets is a small disadvantage

202204 Holding the beautiful memories of Zhongshan Store
Go to the new store site Neihu shop for dinner

Sitting on the track sitting on the aisle
It is very close to the door to the gate
Whether it is the air of the air conditioner or the wind when the door opens in
Fully interfere with guests makes people uncomfortable

No service ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌ ❌
The greetings that should be in the door
Desktop compilation in the middle of the meal
None

Meal
Is the signature lobster boiled?Without seasoning
Shrimp paste has a fishy smell
There is an additional bonus to the hand washing cup

The rib eye, after comparison is a meal that can be available today

Select steak today
Come up dumbfounded
It looks like beef in the bento
This cannot be called steak!Intersection

Salad performance is OK
Tang and dessert disappointment 甜

Price is not cheap
Meal, service, dining environment
Can't keep up with the quality you should have

Will not visit again"
餐廳內空間寬廣，不會有擁擠的感覺，用餐氣氛舒適。上餐速度掌握的很好，吃的時候不會有壓迫感，這點有些餐廳就做得不是很好。幾乎每一道菜都能感受到廚師的用心，從一開始的宜蘭糕渣富有本土的在地感，一路吃到海中的龍蝦，再又回到鮮美的牛肉，最後的甜點也都十分精美，布朗尼與冰淇淋完美結合，冰冰熱熱交融的口感很舒服。價格方面，兩人套餐有龍蝦又有牛排才5000出頭，價格上來說算滿優惠，如果有壽星還會再送特製甜點，很棒的用餐體驗。,"The restaurant has a wide space, no crowded, and the dining atmosphere is comfortable.The speed of meal is very good, and there will be no sense of oppression when eating. Some restaurants are not done well.Almost every dish can feel the chef's intentions. From the beginning of the Yilan cake residue full of local local sense, eat lobster in the sea all the way, and then return to the delicious beef. The last dessert is also very exquisite. The perfect combination of Ni and ice cream, the taste of the blend of ice blending is very comfortable.In terms of price, there are lobster and steaks in the two -person package. The price is full of discounts. If there is a Shouxing, you will also send special desserts, a great dining experience."
"時間：2019/08/30（3.8）商業午餐
商業午餐頗划算，1500以內可以吃到套餐包含雙主菜牛肉和龍蝦半隻。
麵包和前菜普通，不多提，洋蔥濃湯有加起士，很濃郁。
*主餐：牛排部分雖然點了5分熟，但還是略乾，口感外面是脆的不錯，內部就普通了。龍蝦則是非常推薦，肥美新鮮，不會海味過多。
整體來說商午這個價格十分划算，但牛排普通了點；大推龍蝦","Time: 2019/08/30 (3.8) Commercial lunch
Commercial lunch is quite cost -effective. It can be eaten within 1500 that the package includes half of the main vegetable beef and lobster.
The bread and the front dish are ordinary. Not much to mention, the onion soup has a pista, which is very rich.
*Main meal: Although the steak part was cooked for 5 points, it was still slightly dry. The taste was crispy outside, and the inside was normal.Lobster is very recommended. It is fat and fresh and does not have too much seafood.
On the whole, the price of Shangwu is very cost -effective, but the steak is generally a little bit;"
龍蝦鮮口彈牙，熟度恰到好處，一般有些餐廳在蝦螯部分會過老。牛排肉質不錯，風味也很棒，提供三種調味，口味更豐富，吃到後面也不會那麼膩口，前菜視覺效果不錯，但口味上就一般般。,"Lobster's fresh mouth elastic teeth, and the maturity is just right. Generally, some restaurants will be too old in the shrimp chews.The steak is good and the flavor is also great. It provides three flavors. The taste is richer. It will not be so greasy after eating. The visual effect of the front dish is good, but the taste is average."
"這家在二樓壽司店樓上，整體環境還有服務人員算不錯，每個位子都很大，很適合疫情來吃🤣
沙拉就是一般的沙拉，不過可以加價升級換別的，有一種特殊風味說不上來，但是蠻好吃的，可以試試看！麵包的話是冷的，所以可以等湯來了再吃，至於湯的部分，清湯是一般的那種番茄蔬菜湯，沒什麼不好吃或特別厲害這樣，酥皮濃湯個人不怎麼喜歡啦，上面的酥皮是那種一圈一圈的，不是傳統的😅主餐的話好好吃喔，龍蝦好像只有半隻，但是肉就已經很多了，非常新鮮又多汁，牛排我是選軟一點的肉質，也絲毫不遜色，太棒了，這家價錢比較沒那麼貴，又想吃好吃牛排可以考慮！！真的會為了主餐再來欸～剩下酒水，水果酒是他們才有的吧，那時候剛好買一送一，蠻好喝的很不像酒，但酒精濃度15%吧，回去頭有點痛就是了😢","This house on the second floor is upstairs. The overall environment and the service staff are good. Each seat is very large. It is very suitable for the epidemic to eat.
Salad is a general salad, but you can increase the price and upgrade other things. There is a special flavor that cannot be said, but it is pretty delicious, you can try it!The bread is cold, so you can wait for the soup to eat. As for the soup, the clear soup is the ordinary tomato vegetable soup. There is nothing not delicious or particularly powerful. The meringue is that kind of circle, not the traditional main meal, it seems that there are only half of the lobster, but there are already a lot of meat, very fresh and juicy. The meat is not inferior to the meat. It is great. This price is not so expensive, and you can consider eating delicious steak!IntersectionI really will come again for the main meal ~ leftover, fruit wine is only found in. At that time, I just bought one get one free. That's 😢"
"本次用餐在服務上完全沒有問題。當天用餐店家表示龍蝦、生蠔、特調氣泡飲無提供；點餐是單點式，價格上稍嫌貴，相同價位可能會選擇其他家套餐式牛排餐廳。
玉米酥皮濃湯比較可惜，上餐時酥皮是塌陷的，玉米濃湯吃不到玉米（類似摩斯，濃濃玉味），個人較不喜歡這類型的玉米濃湯。","There is no problem in service at all in this meal.On the same day, the dining shop said that lobster, oysters, and special air bubbles were not provided; ordering was a single point, and the price was slightly expensive. The same price may choose other home set meal steak restaurants.
The corn messenger thick soup is unfortunate. The meringue is collapsed when serving. The corn soup cannot eat corn (like Mos, thick jade flavor). I personally don't like this type of corn soup."

"第一次吃，點了肋眼雙人套餐四千多元，前菜還蠻特別的，大腸麵線做成。牛排也蠻嫩的，但是個人不喜歡他們直接把醬汁放在牛排下面，無法吃到牛排原味，我比較喜歡沾玫瑰鹽吃，不喜歡醬汁。
套餐有一隻龍蝦，但吃起來覺得肉很乾，我吃螯的部分，一般肉嫩的話應該很容易一整塊把肉取出，今天龍蝦肉就很容碎口感也沒這麽佳。整體吃起來是很飽足，但要是再訪我就不會考慮龍蝦了。","For the first time, I ordered more than 4,000 yuan for the rib eye two -person set. The front dish was quite special.The steak is also quite tender, but I do n’t like them directly under the steak. I ca n’t eat the taste of steak. I prefer to eat rose salt to eat, and I do n’t like sauce.
There is a lobster in the set meal, but it feels that the meat is very dry. When I eat chelated part, it should be easy to remove the meat from a whole piece of meat. Today, the lobster meat is not so good.The overall taste is very full, but if I visit again, I will not consider lobster."
牛排是美國Prime等級，烹調起來則是外脆內軟的絕佳口感。龍蝦超新鮮，所以不加特別調味就很好吃。配菜部分也看的出店家的用心。,"Steak is the US Prime level, and it is a great sense of cooked and soft inside.Lobster is super fresh, so it is delicious without special seasoning.The dedication to the store also section also watched the store."
開胃菜、湯品前菜、主餐、甜點每道菜都非常用心、美味。服務也十分到位，不壓迫也不怠慢。對待孩子們的互動也很有耐心、有禮。龍蝦鮮美必點，不過熟也沒有太多調味，保有原有的口感和鮮甜。老饕牛排是完美的三分熟，回血完美，切割中毫無滲出，口感潤嫩也有適度的嚼勁，牛肉的鮮美多汁表現很好，不沾任何調味即非常美味！甜點更是畫龍點睛，十分精緻。大推👍🏽 …,"A appetizers, soup pre -dishes, main meals, and desserts are very careful and delicious.The service is also in place.The interaction between children is also very patient and polite.Lobster is delicious, but there is not much flavoring in cooked, retaining the original taste and freshness.The old steak is a perfect three -point cooked. The blood is perfect. There is no exudation in the cutting. The taste is moist and tender and has a moderate chewing. The beef is delicious and juicy. It is very delicious without any seasoning!The dessert is the finishing touch, which is very delicate.Big push ..."
"綻1852 做落於民權西路站附近，環境寬敞，給人一種非常舒適且放鬆高雅的用餐環境。
龍蝦🦞是這裡的主推商品，ㄧ進門就可以看到火生生的龍蝦在魚缸內，由此可知，每一隻龍蝦都是無比的新鮮、一進門就剛好有看見店員在打撈龍蝦。
這次用餐選擇了雙人套餐，龍蝦搭配老饕牛排，道道料理都非常精緻，龍蝦真的不愧為招牌，蝦膏非常的多，奶油口味的處理跟蝦肉的搭配非常對味。
老饕牛排12oz 份量非常足夠，五分熟的處理，表面恰到好處的焦香而內理仍軟嫩適中不帶血水，搭配玫瑰鹽即可感受出肉的香甜味，非常推薦兩人用餐選擇雙人套餐！ …","Blooming 1852 is near the Minzi West Road Station, and the environment is spacious, giving people a very comfortable and relaxed and elegant dining environment.
Lobster 这里 is the main product here. You can see the lobster in the fish tank after entering the door. It can be seen that every lobster is extremely fresh. As soon as you enter the door, you just see that the clerk is salvaging the lobster.
This time, I chose a double set meal. Lobster with old steaks. The dishes are very delicate. Lobster is really worthy of the signboard. There are many shrimp paste.
Old Niu Steak 12oz is very sufficient. The five -point cooked treatment, the surface is just the right fragrant fragrance, and the interior is still soft and suitable without blood water. It can feel the sweetness of the meat with rose salt. IntersectionMowing"
"龍蝦前菜湯品甜點都不錯，主餐牛排三分熟度也剛好，用餐環境也舒適，但是問題在於，牛排上桌已經冷了，可能我龍蝦吃太久，牛排放在我後面等，上來盤子已經不溫了

另外不知道是否故意安排，我覺得餐具霧霧，似乎年限已久

跟茹絲葵同價位餐點的感受上有落差，第一次也是最後一次到訪","Lobster's front dish soup desserts are good, the main meal cow row is just right, and the dining environment is also comfortable, but the problem is that the steak is on the table cold. Maybe I have eaten the lobster for too long. It's not warm anymore

In addition, I don’t know if it is arranged intentionally.

There is a gap in the feelings of the same price with Ruskui. The first time is the last visit."
看來得留個正面評價，為何？因為覺得好吃的顧客，通常是不太會繼續好上再加讚，除非是當下有個特殊好感，因此，個人覺得得幫好店家來增加正面聲量！平時常吃老饕部位的我，在2021年9月27日特地點了紐約客+龍蝦套餐，吃過老饕的人必曉得這部位的優勢，雖說餐廳受到疫情取消了原有的台式前菜的特色，但，嚴格而言，新鮮牛肉入口的那個感動才是重點啊！加油！目前好餐廳都生存不易，希望還能看到你們繼續撐過去！,"It seems to have a positive evaluation, why?Because the customers who feel delicious, they usually do not continue to be better, unless there is a special feeling at the moment, so I personally feel that I have to help a good store to increase the front volume!I usually eat the old parts of the old lady. On September 27, 2021, I specially located the New Yorker+lobster package. Those who have eaten the old lady must know the advantages of this part. Features, but strictly speaking, the move of fresh beef entrance is the point!come on!At present, good restaurants are not easy to survive. I hope you can still see you continue to support it!"
"朋友介紹，來這裡過週年紀念日
一開始的麵包有點遜色
湯品有把水準拉回來
龍蝦用蒸的沒有太多調味
有把鮮甜襯托出來，可惜沒有檸檬做提味
牛排軟嫩恰到好處，蠻喜歡的

最驚艷的是冰淇淋布朗尼！
布朗尼是烤過的，配上冰淇淋口感非常特別

所以送的週年蛋糕整個被比下去😅

但有兩點不是很開心
1.訂位時沒有告知振興卷優惠，所以當天沒有享受到振興鈞贈送的干貝
2.臉書小編說會幫跟我聯繫訂位事宜，但後續不聞不問，一直沒接到電話","Friend introduced, come here to spend the anniversary anniversary
The bread at the beginning is a bit inferior
The soup has pulled back the level back
The lobster is steamed too much without seasoning
There is a sweet sweetness, but unfortunately there is no lemon to make it taste
The steak is soft and tender, and I like it quite

The most amazing is ice cream Browni!
Browni has been grilled, and the taste of ice cream is very special

Therefore, the annual cake given is compared to the whole 😅

But there are two points that are not very happy
1. During the reservation, the revitalization volume discount was not told, so I did not enjoy the scallops presented by the revitalization Jun that day.
2. Facebook Xiaobian said that he would help me to contact me, but I didn't ask the phone afterwards, and I never received a call."
"期待很久終於吃到
生蠔有鮮甜但有個冰箱或水箱的味道
前菜大腸蚵仔麵線一般
南瓜濃湯一般
胭脂蝦沙拉的蝦是溫的沒有鮮甜感
羅西尼牛排的鴨肝膩口適合再多逼出些油脂
菲力的肉粉粉的不多汁也沒有牛肉的甜味與濃郁
熟度是照服務員推薦的熟度
紐約客牛排表現一般
薯泥是台式薯泥沙拉
起司蛋糕味道尚可但偏乾

兩人$4500的價格跟不太優質的肉品來說，
我會選擇Danny’s旗下的餐廳，只是四百元的牛排義大利麵上頭的牛肉都不馬虎且非常美味可口
跟同價位的meatGQ相較之下更是兩個世界","I look forward to it for a long time and finally eat it
The oyster has a sweet but a refrigerator or water tank.
Activaler Large -intestine Taipa Noodle Noodle
Pumpkin soup average
Rouge shrimp salad shrimp is warm and not fresh
Rosini steak’s duck liver greasy mouth is suitable for more oil
Fili’s meat powder is not juicy and without the sweetness and richness of beef
Cooling is the maturity recommended by the waiter
New York guest steak performance is average
Potato puree is desktop potato puree salad
The flavor of the cheese cake is still available but dry

The price of $ 4500 between the two is not too high -quality meat,
I will choose Danny ’s's restaurant, but the beef on the Steak Steak Steak is not sloppy and very delicious.
Compared with Meatgq at the same price, there are two worlds"
"點午間套餐，餐點除了擺盤精緻之外頗為普通。沙拉和主餐的肉相較之下份量很小，大約只有一根半羅曼生菜，整份套餐的安排顯得不太平衡。酥皮濃湯讓人非常傻眼，一上桌服務人員便告知這是自製的酥皮，她會幫我們取下，請我們自己切成小塊再放入湯中，於是才剛上桌的酥皮濃湯就被分解了⋯老實說完全不知道這樣還做成酥皮濃湯的意義何在？蕈菇湯一點也不美味，感覺蘑菇品質不太好，整個湯品不如夜市牛排的酥皮玉米濃湯。主菜尚可但調味稍嫌過鹹，肉也較油，靠少量的肉桂蘋果解膩實在是杯水車薪，若有更多蔬菜或酸味配菜應有幫助，配菜的馬鈴薯泥是整個套餐中唯一覺得不錯的項目。
服務人員大致上態度不錯，點餐時的說明也很專業，值得讚賞。但卻在中餐吃到一半的時間就來詢問對餐點的感想，真的很擾人！難道服務人員不知道干擾他人用餐很不禮貌嗎？
另外冷飲會提供拋棄式吸管，即使拒用也無法提供攪拌棒，實行不塑者建議點熱飲或自備吸管前往。
整體感覺大部分的錢都花在氣氛裝潢上，偏偏裝潢也欠缺考慮，坐的圓桌上方的浪漫燈飾（？）位置跟高度都很奇怪，家人離席時一站起來就撞到頭。是一家空有表面但實際上沒有內涵也欠缺考慮的店，不推薦。","For lunch set, the meal is quite ordinary except for the exquisite set.Compared with the meat of Salad and the main meal, there is a small amount of meat. There are only about one and a half of Roman's lettuce. The arrangement of the entire package seems not balanced.The meringue soup is very dumbfounded. As soon as the serving staff on the table, the service staff told the meringue that she was made. She would help us remove it. Ask us to cut it into a small piece and put it in the soup. The thick soup is decomposed. Honestly, what is the significance of not knowing that it is still the meringue soup?The mushroom soup is not delicious at all. It feels that the quality of mushrooms is not very good.The main dish is still available but the seasoning is slightly salty, and the meat is oily. It is a lot of money to relieve the amount of cinnamon apples. If there are more vegetables or sour side dishes, it should be helpful. I think it is good.
The service staff roughly has a good attitude, and the explanation of ordering is also very professional, which is worthy of appreciation.But when I had half of the Chinese food, I came to ask about the feelings of the meal, which was really disturbing!Does the service staff know that it is impolite to interfere with others?
In addition, cold drinks will provide abandoned straws. Even if they are refused, they cannot provide a stirring rod. For those who are not plastic, it is recommended to order hot drinks or bring their own straws.
The overall feeling that most of the money is spent on the decoration of the atmosphere, and the decoration is also lacking consideration. The romantic lighting (?) Position and height of the romantic lighting above the round table are very strange.It is a shop that is empty but lacks of consideration without connotation. It is not recommended."
"餐點好吃，不失水準。特別推薦爐烤牛排，一如既往穩定且高cp的選擇。鴨肉義大利麵與墨魚海鮮燉飯表現亦佳。但今天的伊比利里肌豬排口感略老，可惜了。
服務態度很好，多次來桌邊解釋與說明廚房忙碌，但真的上菜速度可再增強。","The meal is delicious, without losing the level.It is specially recommended to roast steak, as always stable and high CP choice.Duck's Italian noodles and cuttlefish seafood stew also performed well.But today's Iberrid muscles are slightly old, unfortunately.
The service attitude is very good. He has come to the table to explain and explain the busy kitchen many times, but the speed of serving can be increased."
"店名綻1852的由來是因為在中山北路二段185號2樓的關係，雖然是叫牛排館，但網路上反而對龍蝦的評價比較好。
店裡的經營團隊是過去雅室牛排的團隊，在市場上已經有很不錯的口碑。
此次點了雙人的美國肋眼蓋老饕牛排+加拿大活龍蝦套餐，整個套餐吃下來對龍蝦的印象非常深刻，加奶油簡單的蒸烤就能凸顯出肉質的鮮美。
上蓋熟度控制的不錯，但煎烤的溫度與表面酥脆度有些不足。
而雖然打的是台魂法菜，其他的菜色卻是創意有餘而美味不足，擺盤弄的漂漂亮亮的但不知道在吃什麼反而有些可惜。
餐後有招待自製一口吃的小鳳梨酥，未來有機會會為了龍蝦再來。","The origin of the store name 1852 is because of the relationship between No. 185, No. 185, Section 2, Zhongshan North Road. Although it is called a steak hall, it is better to evaluate lobster on the Internet.
The operating team in the store is the team of the Egyo steak in the past, and there is already a good reputation in the market.
This time I ordered the two -person American ribs covering the old steak+Canadian lobster package. The entire package was very impressed by the lobster. The simple steaming of cream can highlight the deliciousness of the meat.
The upper lid is well controlled, but the temperature and crispy surface of the fried roast are a little insufficient.
Although the soul -soul dishes are used, the other dishes are more creative and delicious. The bleach of it is a pity that it is a pity that I don't know what to eat.
After the meal, there is a small pineapple crisp for self -made, and there will be a chance to come again for lobster in the future."
"糕渣調味和綿密的口感著實讓人經驗
洋蔥湯濃郁可口
前菜明蝦搭配咖哩醬耳目一新
加點的加拿大龍蝦一點也沒有感到失望
尺寸跟肉質遠優於波士頓龍蝦
龍蝦採用蒸煮的方式帶出食材的鮮甜
沒有過多的調味掩蓋食物本身的原味
厚切的帶骨肋眼牛排油花均勻分佈
外皮煎的焦脆散發香氣
Prime等級的肉質軟嫩帶著些許的嚼勁
我與內人對於這餐感到十分滿意","The seasoning and dense taste of cake residue are really experienced
Onion soup is rich and delicious
Qiancai Ming shrimp with curry sauce is refreshing
The Canadian lobster that adds a little bit is not disappointed at all
The size and meat are far better than Boston lobster
The lobster uses cooking to bring out the sweetness of the ingredients
Without too much seasoning, covering the original flavor of the food itself
Thick -cut bone rib eye oxee oil flowers are evenly distributed
The scorched crispy of the outer skin exudes the aroma
PRIME -level meat is soft and tender with a little chewy
I am very satisfied with this meal and I am very satisfied with this meal"
"109/9/1起暫停營業整修中，用餐體驗是8月底。

初訪，看到門牌會心一笑，店名的由來原來餐廳門牌是185號2樓。因為在2樓，窗外是一片樹海，喜歡這樣的綠意，店內裝潢一般，簡單舒適，點了假日午餐，價格實惠，酥皮濃湯的酥皮應該是店家自製的，同行的所有人都覺得好吃，生菜沙拉看起來不多，但我覺得是頗剛好的份量，可以完食不浪費，主菜的部分有選擇舒肥牛小排，我自己不愛這種口感，而且比較油的感覺，但同行的人很喜歡。另外的主菜是爐烤牛排，傳統的烹調方式還是較為習慣的口感，個人覺得喜歡。","From 109/9/1, the dining experience is at the end of August.

When I first visited, I smiled at the door of the house.Because on the second floor, there is a sea of ​​trees outside the window. I like this kind of green. The interior of the store is average, simple and comfortable. I ordered holiday lunch. The price of the plasma soup should be self -made. I think it ’s delicious, and the lettuce salad does n’t look much, but I think it’ s just right. You can eat it without waste. It feels, but the people who are peers like it very much.The other main dish is a steak for stoves. The traditional cooking method is still more accustomed to taste. I personally think it."
"龍蝦口味好吃的沒話說，肉質Q彈配上蒜味奶油，一定要記得留下麵包沾龍蝦膏食用。
但舒肥牛小排就普通，戰斧豬肉質好吃但醃漬過重掩蓋了肉汁的甜味，可惜。
服務覺的真的能再加強，豬排吃了1/3才問我需不需要沾醬，餐巾掉到地上服務生看到也沒有主動更換，希望服務能更到位，才能搭配好吃的美食。","The lobster taste is delicious. It ’s nothing to say. The meat Q bombs are matched with garlic flavor cream. Be sure to leave the bread with lobster cream.
But Shu fat beef steak is ordinary. Tomahawk pork is delicious but pickled over the sweetness of the gravy, but unfortunately.
The service consciousness can really be strengthened. After eating 1/3 of the pork chop, I asked me if I need to dip the sauce. The napkin fell to the ground waiter and did not take the initiative to replace it. I hope that the service can be more in place to match delicious food."
"新開的牛排館，幫好友慶生前往用餐。四人份吃了快10000元，其實不便宜，有餐前麵包（兩種口味的麵包），湯選了四種:經典酥皮蘑菇湯（酥皮好吃）；魚湯（容器是虹吸壺），我覺得只是噱頭，料理不特別；洋蔥湯很鹹；蕃茄牛肉湯一般。

前菜選了4種:北海道大干貝，八寶芋（感覺像是台式肉粽，只是米飯換成是芋泥），大西洋國王鮭（有鮭魚卵，但是是燻鮭魚，以為是烤或煎的鮭魚，應該寫清楚），鼎邊剉  一般。

主餐:龍蝦好吃，牛排:單吃就好，服務員給的沾醬都不好吃:有玫瑰鹽（超鹹），哇沙米好像混白蘿蔔的沾醬（不愛哇沙米，而且沾牛排好怪）。

甜點部分:有一個蘭姆葡萄乾青蘋果慕斯（須加價100元），甜點也沒有特別驚喜，檸檬蛋糕太乾（看到隔壁桌也沒吃完）。

飲料:就一般咖啡，紅茶，花茶。

現場燈光昏暗，拍照需要開閃光燈才好拍照。

費用均分下來一人約2500元，大家參考看看。","Newly opened steak halls, help friends celebrate their birthday to dine.The four people ate 10,000 yuan, but it was not cheap. There were meals (two flavors of bread). The soup was selected: classic plasma mushroom soup (delicious plasma); fish soup (container is a siphon pot ), I think it's just a gimmick, the dishes are not special; the onion soup is very salty; the tomato beef soup is average.

There are 4 types of previous dishes: Hokkaido Dabei, Babao taro (feel like a desktop meat, but the rice is replaced with taro puree), the Atlantic king salmon (with salmon eggs, but it is smoked salmon, it is thought to be roasted or fried salmon It should be written clearly), Dingbian is average.

Main meal: Lobster is delicious, steak: Just eat it alone, the diplomats given the sauces not delicious: there are rose salt (super salty), wow Sami seems to be mixed with white radish dipping sauce (do not love wow Shami, and The stained beef is weird).

Dessert part: There is a Rim raisin green apple mousse (100 yuan price increase), and the dessert is not particularly surprised. Lemon cakes are too dry (I have not finished eating the table next door).

Drinks: Just coffee, black tea, flower tea.

The lights on the scene were dim, and the flashing of the flash needs to be taken to take pictures.

The cost is about 2,500 yuan, please refer to it."
"慶祝Ph.D.成就達成，請全家再訪，使用振興卷方案，前菜各有特色，龍蝦新鮮，兩種牛排都十分好吃，賓主盡歡。
場域舒適安靜，餐桌間隔寬廣，聊天不易受打擾。推周三-龍蝦之夜。虱目魚清湯採法式清湯做法。前菜的明蝦和鼎邊剉也很有特色。想吃肉的推薦紐約客牛排，嚼勁肉味十足。肋眼個人覺得有點肥，但比較軟嫩適合老年人。搭配的烤蔬菜很加分。","Celebrate the achievements of PH.D., please visit the whole family, use the revitalization volume plan, the former dishes have their own characteristics, the lobster is fresh, the two steaks are very delicious, and the guests are happy.
The field is comfortable and quiet, the dining table is wide, and the chat is not easy to be disturbed.Push Wednesday-Lobster Night.Masterpiece French soup method.The first dish's shrimp and Dingbian also have distinctive features.I want to eat meat, New York guest steak, chewy and full of meat.The rib eyes personally feel a bit fat, but it is more soft and tender suitable for the elderly.The grilled vegetables are very extra points."
"放在口袋很久，終於安排上了。
吃完之後很久考慮要不要評價，
無意發現谷歌預測我的好感度只有47%
（谷歌你為什麼那麼懂我?!?!）

餐廳氛圍很不錯，菜單搭配我也很喜歡
前菜擺盤不用說，配菜沙拉品質都很優
（但佛卡夏麵包私心不喜歡）

畢竟是牛排館，主菜決定一切
今天點了舒肥牛、肋眼、生蠔，跟預期都有落差
舒肥牛小排熟度沒有問題，但大半塊是難切斷的筋，當然以當天遇到的所有服務人員都是非常熱切的，若反應我相信會更換，但有時候客戶只想找個好餐廳輕鬆愉快用餐，而不是多花30分鐘批評食物跟等待新的食物。","Put on your pocket for a long time and finally arrange it.
After eating it for a long time, think about whether to evaluate,
No intention to find that Google predicts that my favorability is only 47%
(Google, why do you understand me so much? !?!)

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good, I also like the menu matching
Needless to say, the quality of the salad is very good
(But Foka summer bread does not like it)

After all, it is a steak hall, the main cuisine determines everything
Today I ordered Shu Fei, ribs, and oysters, and there is a gap with expectations
There is no problem with Shu Fei Niu Xiaoling, but most of them are difficult to cut off. Of course, all the service staff encountered on the day are very enthusiastic. The restaurant is easy to eat and eat, instead of spending 30 minutes to criticize food and wait for new food."
"台北老牌高價牛排館， 食物質素okay, 但服務有待改進。 以這價格， 服務生竟然不記著客人點的餐點，隨意上菜掉亂了， 這不能接受吧？！ 加價$800 的龍蝦還好， 但試過就算， 不會再點咯。","Taipei ’s old -fashioned high -priced steak hall, the quality of food is OKAY, but the service needs to be improved.At this price, the waiter did not remember the meals that the guests ordered, and the dishes were chaotic at will. Is this unacceptable?IntersectionIt is okay to increase the lobster with a price of $ 800, but even if you try it, you will not order it again."
"看到朋友的推薦才知道NTD550 的商業午餐，竟然可以嚐到這麼美味的牛排，外層酥脆、內層多汁，這烤工真的是一流，原來是雅室牛排的前主廚開的店，在台北市這個價位的套餐應該無人能敵！

餐前麵包 也馬虎
連法國廚神 Paul Bocuse 在1975 年在國宴上創作的酥皮濃湯也 還不錯
最後還有咖啡作ending
很棒！

酥皮濃湯 與 龍蝦半尾 需加價","When I saw my friend's recommendation, I knew that the business lunch of the NTD550 can be tasted such a delicious steak. The outer layer is crispy and the inner layer is juicy. This baked worker is really first -class. The package at this price in Taipei should be unattended!

The bread in front of the meal is also sloppy
Even the French chef Paul Bocuse's meringue soup created at the national banquet in 1975 is not bad
Finally, there is coffee as ending
great!

Poor soup and lobster half -tail need to increase the price"
"前菜蚵仔麵線的概念去發想，脆脆的口感，很特別。
麵包是佛卡夏，我比較喜歡鬆軟麵包。
加點的鴨肝沒有腥味，配上麵包非常好吃～
蒸烤活龍蝦肉體飽滿並且Q彈，偏淡的調味但好吃。
老饕牛排肉質偏軟但香，加一點海鹽整個甜味都散發出來，很優秀！
整體的餐點都好吃，滿推薦的！","The concept of the former vegetable Taipa noodle line is thought, the crispy taste is very special.
Bread is Foxia, I prefer soft bread.
The duck liver has no fishy smell, and it is very delicious with bread ~
Steamed and baked lobster is full and Q bombs, light seasoning but delicious.
The old beef steak meat is soft but fragrant, and the whole sweetness of the sea salt exudes it, which is excellent!
The overall meal is delicious, it is recommended!"
"裝潢很不錯、生意很好，平日中午去還客滿，服務生動作很粗魯，分菜時還把菜掉到我們身上，但態度不錯，不會扣分。
三個人總共5,500元就吃的飽，價格上還ok，尤其是商業午餐不用1,000元非常划算！
糕渣：吃起來很像很軟嫩的蘿蔔糕，但我們都沒有很喜歡
麵包：中規中矩，沒有特別好吃
虱目魚澄清魚湯：裝在虹吸式的容器裡很有噱頭，湯有一股酸酸的酒味
洋蔥湯：超級真材實料，沒喝過這麼濃郁的洋蔥湯，濃到有點像洋蔥醬了
經典酥皮蘑菇湯：湯很濃郁，菇味很重，酥皮很紮實，跟外面買到的不一樣
北海道大干貝：干貝很新鮮，旁邊配的沙拉很特別，都是平常不太會吃到的菜
澎湖大明蝦：蝦子的size沒有很大，但很新鮮，搭配泰式醬，有一點搶到蝦子的鮮甜味
美國自然紐約客牛排：24oz就很多，兩個人吃非常足夠，推薦熟度是三分熟，切開來裡面都還是生的，但吃起來不會噁心，肉還滿軟的，裝肉的瓷盤很燙，如果覺得太生隨時可以自己加熱；配菜三杯杏鮑菇很好吃，炸蒜片是有厚度的、也很酥脆，最特別的是炸青辣椒，是鹹酥雞的調味很好吃
加拿大龍蝦：調味是大蒜奶油，應該是我目前吃過最好吃的龍蝦，蝦肉很彈，也很鮮甜
香提藍莓乳酪塔、蘭姆葡萄乾青蘋果慕斯：甜點都偏甜，擺盤很漂亮","The decoration is very good and the business is very good. He is full at noon on weekdays. The waiter moves rudely. When you split the dishes, you will drop the dishes on us, but your attitude is good and will not deduct points.
A total of three people eat a total of 5,500 yuan, and the price is OK, especially the commercial lunch is very cost -effective!
Cake residue: It tastes very soft and tender, but we don’t like it very much
Bread: satisfactory, not particularly delicious
Satisher clarifying fish soup: It is a gimmick installed in a siphon -type container, and the soup has a sour wine flavor
Onion soup: Super real ingredients, I haven't drank such a strong onion soup, so thicker like onion sauce
Classic plasma mushroom soup: the soup is very strong, the mushroom taste is very heavy, the plasma is solid, which is different from the outside
Hokkaido big scallops: The scallops are very fresh, and the salad next to it is very special.
Penghu Emerald Shrimp: The size of the shrimp is not very large, but it is very fresh. With Thai -style sauce, it has a little sweetness of the shrimp
Nature in the United States New York Steak: There are many 24oz, two people eat very enough, the recommended maturity is three -pointer, and it is still raw inside, but it will not be disgusting. The plate is very hot. If you feel that it is too raw, you can heat it yourself at any time; the three cups of Pleurotus eryngii with the side vegetables are delicious, and the fried garlic slices are thick and crispy. The most special is green pepper. Delicious
Canadian lobster: Seasoning is garlic cream. It should be the best lobster I have ever eaten at present. The shrimp is very elastic and fresh and sweet.
Slang Blueberry cheese tower, Rim raisin green apple mousse: desserts are sweet, and the plate is very beautiful"
今天點了鴨肝菲力與牛小排兩道主餐，以及套餐。前菜選了鮪魚與鮭魚，橘子跟鮭魚搭配雖然不錯，但鮪魚更讓我喜歡一些。糕渣很好吃，口感跟味道都滿意，比前菜沙拉還喜歡。湯品不錯，雖沒有驚艷，但也達到預期中的好味道。重頭戲牛排來了，有三種佐料可以複選，海鹽、黃芥末以及辣根醬。菲力是點Medium五分熟，口感完美，因為菲力少油，所以搭配鴨肝一起享受可以達到平衡。這裏的海鹽很鹹，所以搭配少許即十分足夠。牛小排是固定熟度，這邊覺得搭配辣根醬是最好吃的組合。馬鈴薯配菜很好吃，但梅子味番茄有點太重了。至於今天失分在於甜點，熔岩巧克力挺失望的，過去的Chilis組合地比較好，這邊基本上沒組合，而且自行組合味道也不夠美味，可惜了點。另外要加價100元的蘋果則達到正常水準，算是個完成度比較高的作品。整體綜合四星是真心覺得不錯但仍有改善空間，因為價格不便宜所以會嚴格來寫心得，期望變得更好。,"Today, I ordered two main meals, and cows, and the set meal.The former dish was selected by catfish and salmon. Although the orange and salmon are good, but the catfish makes me like it.The cake residue is delicious, the taste and taste are satisfactory, and they like it more than the former dish salad.The soup is good. Although it is not amazing, it also reaches the good taste.The heavy -duty steak is here. There are three kinds of condiments to check, sea salt, yellow mustard and hot root sauce.Fili is cooked with five points and the taste is perfect. Because Fili is less oily, it can be balanced with duck liver.The sea salt here is very salty, so it is enough to match it.Niu Xiaowei is a fixed maturity. Here I think it is the best combination with hot root sauce.The potato side dishes are delicious, but the plum taste tomato is a bit too heavy.As for the dessert today, the lava chocolate is disappointed. The past Chilis combination is better. It is basically no combination here, and the combination of itself is not delicious enough. Unfortunately, it is a bit.In addition, apples with a price increase of 100 yuan have reached normal level, which is a relatively high degree of completion.The overall comprehensive four -star is really good but there is still room for improvement. Because the price is not cheap, it will strictly write experiences and expect to become better."
"今天點了份簡單的商業午餐，酥皮濃湯+今日的主廚推薦：龍蝦義大利麵，再加餐後紅茶

先說湯，是溫的，本以為我都加酥皮了，應該熱度會是夠的(加上今天有點變冷所以想喝熱湯)，沒想到是溫的…

龍蝦義大利麵倒是表現正常，連醬汁溫度都濃湯高，真是令人意外！

紅茶就一般般真的一般般","Today I ordered a simple commercial lunch. The messenger thick soup+today's chef recommendation: lobster pasta, plus meals after meals

Let ’s talk about soup first. It’ s warm. I thought I had added meringue. It should be enough (plus the cold today, so I want to drink hot soup), but I did n’t expect it to be warm ...

Lobster Italian noodles are normal, and even the sauce temperature is high, which is surprising!

Black tea is ordinary as ordinary"
"牛排外酥內軟非常美味，服務也都在水準之上,就是裝潢真的太瞎了！人均2000的餐廳，裝潢跟隔壁的學生餐廳差不多，一大盆塑膠花在旁邊，鼻子都癢癢的。","The steak is very soft and soft inside, and the services are all above the standard. That is, the decoration is really blind!The restaurant with a per capita 2000 is similar to the student restaurant next door. A large pot of plastic flower is beside it, and the nose itchy."

前菜很精緻好吃，主菜龍蝦很棒，牛排不夠熱跟香。服務員沒有記點餐位置，以價位來說蠻令人驚訝的。CP不特別高～,"The former dish is very delicate and delicious.The waiter did not remember the location of the meal, and it was surprising at the price.CP is not particularly high ~"
商業午餐選了戰斧豬排。豬排沒有腥味且外酥內軟十分美味。表現令人驚艷。配菜的薯泥也很出色。口感不但細滑且口味濃郁。四季豆跟杏鮑菇雖是簡單調味但不失美味。整體的餐點令人非常滿意。絕對會再訪,"The commercial lunch was selected.The pork chop has no fishy smell and is very delicious inside.The performance is amazing.The potato puree of the side dishes is also excellent.The taste is not only smooth and rich.Although the four seasons and Pleurotus eryngii are simply seasoning, they are delicious.The overall meal is very satisfactory.Absolutely visit again"
虱目魚湯加蕃紅花用虹吸咖啡方式桌邊表演有噱頭但料稍嫌不足。正常套餐所附調酒顏色很美白酒濃度適中又好喝。羊排口味無可挑惕。商業午餐假日可點CP值頗高，商午沙朗牛排建議三分熟最好吃，生日甜點椪糖用液態氮冷凍好看好玩又好吃。唯一要criticize的一點是屋頂沒封沒裝潢，整個餐廳都弄得漂漂亮亮而且餐點服務都走中高階路線。人家prime168在sogo百貨、教父牛排在三越，停車方便地點又好。要賣高價任何小地方都不能省略。在任何方面都要能與這些大哥競爭才行,"Smok soup plus Fan safflower with siphon coffee on the table has gimmicks on the table, but it is slightly not enough.The color of the normally package is very beautiful and delicious.The flavor of the lamb chops is unsatisfactory.The CP value of commercial lunch holidays is quite high. Shangwu Sharon Steak is recommended to be the best three -point cooked. Birthday dessert sugar is frozen with liquid nitrogen. It is delicious and delicious.The only point for Criticize is that the roof is not sealed or decorated. The entire restaurant is beautiful and the meal service has taken the high -level route.The Prime168 is in SOGO Department Store and the godfather steak at Sanyue, and the parking location is convenient.You must not omit the high price in any small place.In any respect, you must be able to compete with these big brothers"
一上二樓，就看到以前雅室的熟悉面孔，原來連一些領班和服務生都是原班人馬班師至此。當天是平日晚上消費，餐廳大概半滿，空間非常寬敞舒適，有沙發及一般椅子，整體氣氛有點像高雅的酒吧。一開始，有個小小的吐司盒子做為開胃，蠻特別的。湯的部份，酥皮濃湯是一慣的好滋味，和以前在前雅室喝到的一模一樣；洋蔥濃湯也燉得入味，沒什麼可挑剔的。前菜的大干貝表現普通，但澎湖大明蝦非常鮮甜，值得一嚐。主餐部份，當天點了三份老饕牛排，五分熟七分熟的都有，熟度掌控的非常好，相較於舊雅室更為厚實，皮也都酥酥脆脆的；唯其中一塊肉中間有條很硬的筋貫串，不太好咬。甜點方面，不論是派、熔岩布朗尼、或是綠蘋果造型慕斯蛋糕都表現不俗，且吃到甜點時都已經很飽了！整體來說，在這邊還能找到懷念的雅室的影子，再加入了很多新的元素，會考慮再訪。,"On the second floor, I saw the familiar faces of Yauro before. The original leader and waiter were the original classmates Magan.It was consumed on the night of the day. The restaurant was about half full. The space was very spacious and comfortable. There were sofas and ordinary chairs. The overall atmosphere was a bit like an elegant bar.At the beginning, there was a small toast box as an appetizer, which was quite special.The part of the soup is a good taste, which is exactly the same as the previous drinking in Qianya. The onion soup is also stewed, there is nothing to be picky.The big scallops of the former dish are ordinary, but the prawns in Penghu are very sweet and worth trying.The main meal part, I ordered three old steaks that day, and there are five cooked and seven cooked. The cookedness is very good. It is thicker than the old elegant room, and the skin is crispy and crispy. One of the pieces of meat has a very hard rib, not very easy to bite.In terms of desserts, whether it is faction, lava Brony, or the green apple -shaped mousse cake, it is good, and it is already full when eating desserts!Overall, you can find the shadow of the Machalmo here, and then add a lot of new elements, and you will consider visiting again."
這間很可以阿！午餐可以用幾百塊吃到頂級牛排豬排套餐，本人吃豬肉，肉片大約有五公分厚，肉質多汁，沿著豬肉橫紋切片幾乎可以一刀切下去，豬油花搭配醬汁真的很棒，餐前有鮭魚沙拉，鮭魚共有三片很新鮮，餐前麵包有兩塊，每人會附上一片起司塊，幫麵包增加層次提高口感，唯一比較可惜的是飲料，飲品選擇都是相對平價的選擇，喝起來沒什麼特別。服務很棒，有對應到新手服務員，看似緊張但服務不馬虎，環境也很舒服，整體來說，推推！,"This is very good!You can eat a top steak pork steak for lunch for lunch. I eat pork. The meat slices are about five centimeters thick and the meat is juicy. The slices of the pork horizontal pattern can be cut almost in one knife. The lard flower with sauce is really great. There are salmon salads before the meal. There are three slices of salmon, and there are two pieces of bread in front of the meal. Each person will attach a cheese block to increase the bread to increase the taste. The choice is nothing special.The service is great, there are novice waiters, seemingly nervous but not sloppy, and the environment is very comfortable. On the whole, push!"
"令人感動的牛排館😍感覺的出來主廚想走出一條屬於自己風格的道路~在西餐中融入自己故鄉的特色美味~覺得台灣可以多一些這樣的店~存錢也要再來捧場~
推今天吃的紐約客和肋眼~外皮烤的酥脆，有點cowcow的囗感，內部卻嫩的要命，肉的品質很好，是值得它價格的牛排~兩人份3000多到6000多，是全套的喔🤣有蒸餾的清魚湯，台灣造型的芋頭創意料理，清甜Q彈的龍蝦，青蘋果泥蛋糕，溫潤好入喉的茶...滿足到用晚餐不吃來保留口腔的味道XD

已回訪多次，每次的牛排與龍蝦美味都不會讓人失望，服務也良好，值得推薦的優質餐廳！,"It has been visited many times. Each steak and lobster are not disappointing, and the service is also good. It is worth recommending high -quality restaurants!"
服務非常細心，介紹餐點也對告知費用及優惠資訊。最近平日午餐舒肥牛小排880第二客半價，菜單上也有生日優惠。南瓜濃湯覺得南瓜味不太夠（喜歡南瓜濃湯的話期待不能太高），麵包佛卡夏可以無限續，覺得很讚，舒肥牛小排很好吃，外皮有焦脆感。龍蝦半隻也很鮮甜Q彈很好吃，預算夠的話可以吃龍蝦🦞還有附龍蝦工具、紙圍巾和洗手水，飲料點果汁氣泡飲說是草莓口味不過喝起來像櫻桃口味個人不太喜歡這種櫻桃香料（下面放糖漿，上面氣泡水），另外單點甜點提拉米蘇150 餡料是好吃的，不過蛋糕體沒有咖啡味，以提拉米蘇控來說不推。整體氣氛服務都很好，還有桌邊結帳，會想再回訪。 …,"The service is very careful.Recently, lunch is a second price of a secondary price of the fat cow small steak 880, and there is also a birthday discount on the menu.Pumpkin soup feels that the flavor of pumpkin is not enough (if you like pumpkin soup, you should not be too high). The bread Fogka can be continued infinitely. It feels great.The lobster half is also very fresh and sweet Q bullets are delicious. If the budget is enough, you can eat lobster 🦞 🦞 🦞 🦞, paper scarf and hand washing water. I like this kind of cherry fragrance (put syrup below, bubble water on it), and a single dessert Tiramisu 150 filling is delicious, but the cake body does not have a coffee flavor.The overall atmosphere service is very good, and there are tables at the table, and you will want to return to visit.Mowing"
秘書節聚餐，每人1800元＋10％，含大龍蝦半隻，主菜有舒肥牛小排、豬排及義大利麵三選一，份量足以溫飽，料理也不錯吃，CP值高，值得來嚐鮮。,"The Secretary's Day dinner, 1,800 yuan per person, half of the lobster, half of the main cuisine, the main dishes have three choices of three chops, pork chops and pasta. Everbright."

台北新開的牛排館，但經營團隊有35年西餐廳經驗。每道菜都很細緻且有故事，把台灣本土食材與飲食文化融合到西餐裡，令人驚艷！,"The newly opened steakhouse in Taipei, but the operating team has 35 years of experience in Western restaurant.Each dish is very delicate and stories. It is amazing to integrate Taiwan's local ingredients and food culture into Western food!"
"午間套餐CP值不錯 龍蝦新鮮調味也很到位
缺點是義大利麵體太少選擇、軟殼蟹吃起來濕軟沒味道
服務方面很棒 但龍蝦跟主餐不該一起上桌會冷掉
然後原來生日有招待甜點...殘念","The CP value of the lobbies is good, the fresh seasoning of the lobster is also in place
The disadvantage is that there are too few Italian faces to choose from, and the soft shell crab tastes wet and soft
The service is great, but the lobster and the main meal should not be able to get on the table together
Then there are entertainment desserts on the birthday ... disabled"
平日商業午餐價格合理。食物也很好吃。點了兩種牛排都很不錯。熱熱的麵包很好。湯品也不錯。沙拉很特別。甜點就普普通通了。整體來說很滿意。下次願意來試試看晚餐高級牛排。,The price of commercial lunch is reasonable on weekdays.The food is also delicious.It's good to order two kinds of steaks.The hot bread is very good.The soup is also good.Salad is very special.Dessert is ordinary.Overall is very satisfied.I would like to try the high -end steak next time.
"第一張照片是生日送的膨糖，第一次吃膨糖真的很喜歡，雖然吃的超飽的，還是把它吃完^^
整體餐點都好吃，牛排外酥內嫩，龍蝦雖然很貴但真的超好吃😋，餐點擺盤都很用心，生蠔不知道是什麼產地的，大小類似美國桶蠔，但沒有腥味，口感略脆，味道還不錯，值得加購，環境舒適，食物美味：） …","The first photo is the puff sugar delivered by the birthday. For the first time, I really like it. Although I eat it, I still eat it ^^
The overall meal is delicious. The steak is crispy and tender outside. Although the lobster is very expensive, it is really delicious. The meals are very attentive. The oysters do not know what are the place of origin. The taste, the taste is slightly crispy, the taste is not bad, it is worth buying, comfortable environment, delicious food :) ..."
"空間寬敞舒適
前菜、濃湯還不錯
鴨胸義大利麵滿失望的
麵偏鹹、鴨肉的部分又乾又硬
生日蛋糕口味滿普通的","Spacious and comfortable space
Previous dishes and soup are pretty good
Duck breasts are full of disappointment
The surface is salty, the part of the duck meat is dry and hard

用餐氣氛、以及現場服務的人員都非常好，牛排、龍蝦的品質也在水準之上，唯獨凱薩沙拉整體調味對我們而言已經到非常鹹，有點吃不慣。,The dining atmosphere and the on -site services are very good. The quality of steaks and lobster is also above the standard. Only the overall seasoning of Kaisa salad is very salty for us and is a bit uncomfortable.
超級好吃的厚切紐約克牛排！皮脆肉多汁又不會咬不動！搭配的炒九層塔香料也很對味！酥皮湯是很懷舊的好味道，龍蝦也非常可口，還有融入台灣小吃元素的前菜、湯品都可圈可點！,"Super delicious thick cut New York gram steak!The crispy meat is juicy and can't bite!The frying nine -layer tower spices are also very right!The meringue soup is very nostalgic, and the lobster is also very delicious. The front dishes and soups that integrate the elements of Taiwanese snacks are remarkable!"
牛排很嫩，本來覺得特餐會不會比較馬虎，出乎意料，還是保有一定水準，龍蝦肉彈牙，來主打龍蝦、牛排的餐廳，點這兩樣一定不會失望。,The steak is very tender. I originally felt that the special meal would be relatively sloppy. It was unexpected. It still kept a certain level. Lobster flesh elastic teeth to focus on lobster and steak restaurants. You would not be disappointed.

服務人員相當得體與貼心，菜色創意與美味兼具！西式的牛排搭配台灣小吃當前菜真的是很棒！美食加上裝潢擺設的用心，可以感受到經營者的專業,"The service staff is quite decent and intimate, with both dishes and deliciousness!Western -style steak with Taiwanese snacks is really great!The intention of food and decoration can feel the professional of the operator"
"燈光美氣氛佳，這次是公司聚餐才有機會來吃這麼高級的店家。

松露野菇義大利麵
菇真的很多，松露本身香氣跟量都很足，每一口都吃得到，整體調味適當，我個人偏好松露再鹹一點點就是了。

牛排的部分略微可惜，我覺得普通。可是佐料提供的芥末子很酷，值得一試。

有機會可以來試試，不過對於不常吃這些的我來說已經非常高級了。","The lights are beautiful. This time, the company has a chance to have a chance to eat such a high -end shop.

Tulu wild mushroom pasta
There are really a lot of mushrooms. The aroma and amount of truffles themselves are sufficient. Each bite can be eaten. The overall seasoning is appropriate. I personally prefer that the truffle is a little salty.

The steak is a pity, I think it is ordinary.However, the mustard provided by the condiments is cool and it is worth trying.

You can try it if you have a chance, but it is already very advanced for me."
餐飲名人毛哥領導團隊，再創牛排館新境界，引領牛排館20年以上的經驗，如今再度結合牛排龍蝦與在地名菜，增添西洋料理的全新體驗；前菜驚見八寶芋，鼎邊銼等地方小食，牛排首推紐約克，三分熟的調理，吃得到牛排原味的甜嫩多汁與外表的燒烤香味，龍蝦的鮮甜美味也是值得一提，連龍蝦頭部在剝食之餘，都能體會吮指回味的樂趣。,"Catering celebrities Mao Ge's leadership team, creating a new realm of steakhouses, leading the experience of the steakhouse for more than 20 years. Now it is again combined with steak lobster and local famous dishes to add a new experience of western cuisine.排 Steak, steak pushing New Yaying, three -point conditioning, eating the original sweet and juicy scent of the steak, the sweet and juicy scent of the appearance, the sweet and deliciousness of the lobster is worth mentioning. Yu can experience the fun of sucking fingers."
"原雅室團隊
之所以取名1852服務員告知有兩層意義
1、在185號2樓
2、老闆創立雅室到離開服務有1852週(35年)

餐點與牛排真的沒話說
點了三人老饕加龍蝦
其前菜、湯品、沙拉、主菜一直到甜點都讓人吮指

可惜酥皮蘑菇湯的酥皮屑屑
喝完後並沒有協助清理桌面
一直到結束……唯一敗筆","Yuanya Room Team
The reason why the waiter is named 1852 informs the meaning of two layers
1. On the 2nd floor of No. 185
2. The boss founded the elegant room to the departure service.

The meal is really nothing to say with the steak
I ordered the old lady and the lobster
Its front dishes, soups, salads, and main dishes make people suck their fingers until desserts

Unfortunately, the crispy dandruff
After drinking, I did not help clean up the desktop
Until the end ... the only defeat"
"服務非常到位，但餐點品質與內容無法相襯其價位，可惜了。

1. 肋眼很薄，導致即使只有5分熟口感仍不夠多汁也不夠軟嫩。

2. 前菜鼎邊銼搭配的豆芽有很生的土腥味。

3. 套餐份量較精緻，例如: 前菜與沙拉是二選一，而非兩者皆有，飽足度不足。

4. 隨甜點與飲料上桌的蔓越莓棉花糖，人工香料味太重，破壞了整體套餐的質感。

套餐中最滿意的是甜點檸檬蛋糕。","The service is in place, but the quality and content of the meal cannot be lined up, but unfortunately.

1. The ribs are very thin, which causes the ribs to feel soft enough even if it is not juicy enough.

2. The bean sprouts with the front dish of the Ding Ding have a very earthy smell.

3. The amount of packages is more exquisite. For example, the pre -dish and salad are one of the two, not both, and the satiety is insufficient.

4. With the dessert and the cranberry marshmallow on the table, the artificial spice taste is too heavy, destroying the texture of the overall package.

The most satisfying package is the dessert lemon cake."

"12/18午餐。1.門口量體溫的不穿制服像來打工
2.出餐順序錯，湯先上才給冷菜，詢問之後理由一堆？
3.沙拉還在吃就上牛排，趕個毛啊，你們生意沒那麼好好嗎！拼翻桌率是不是
4.牛排冷的，就想問是放多久？
5.加價的干貝裡面是冰的，怎麼不直接給我吃生的？
6.開吃三分鐘才過來問要什麼調味料
7.切了第一塊突然說可以換牛排刀，啊中間是在合成專武中嗎？
8.結帳忘記我們有先預付
9.菜單都掉漆了還在用
10.服務生標準打工仔，收盤子也不先問，直接一個鬼影手幫你拿掉，來去無蹤，著實讓人覺得厲害。

收費那麼高，也不會問用餐心得，也還好沒問，整個用餐體驗令人生氣到可能會想把整個龍蝦缸打破。
完完全全不推薦，5000元的價格連500都不值得，台北市中山北路上的一代名店，弄得自己跟新竹品質一樣，要不要考慮收掉算了，其他最近google評論也說品質掉得一塌糊塗，看來是都沒改善。

12/28更新
店家會隨意公佈用餐者個資，建議要來用餐的人要小心，留下負評會被揚言提告，也不看看自己犯法在先。
打去了解只得到一堆沒用的答覆，顧左右而言他，不專心在自己餐點上，道歉也沒誠意，用個餐壓力真大。","12/18 lunch.1. The gate temperature at the door does not wear uniforms to work like a uniform
2. The order of the meal is wrong, and the soup is given to the cold food first.
3. Salads are still eating steaks, catching a hair, are you not so good about your business!Is it a pseudo -turn table rate?
4. The steak is cold, just want to ask how long?
5. The scallops that increase the price are ice. Why don't you give me a raw?
6. Open for three minutes before asking what seasonings you want
7. After cutting the first piece, I suddenly said that it can be changed to a bull knife. Is it in the middle of synthesis?
8. Forgot to pay for the checkout, we have prepaid first
9. The menu is painted
10. The waiter's standard migrant worker, do not ask first, take a ghost shadow to help you take it away, and there is no trace. It really makes people feel good.

The charge is so high, and I do n’t ask the meal experience. Fortunately, I did n’t ask. The entire dining experience is so angry that I may want to break the entire lobster tank.
It is not recommended at all. The price of 5,000 yuan is not worth it. A generation of famous shops on Zhongshan North Road, Taipei City make themselves the same as Hsinchu quality. Do you want to consider it? It seems that it has not improved.

12/28 Update
The store will announce the personal capital of the diners at will. It is recommended that those who come to dine should be careful. Leave a negative comment will be threatened to state, and they will not look at their illegal illegal first.
He only got a bunch of useless answers. Gu Zuo, he did not concentrate on his own meal. He had no sincerity, and the pressure of a meal was really great."

"網路上很多人推薦的排餐
特地訂了假日中午時段來幫家人慶生

點了牛小排、紐約客、肋眼、羊排
前菜沙拉、麵包、濃湯一般
（本來有點清湯  但點完餐一陣子服務生突然又跑來問說清湯供應不足可不可以換成濃湯  不太清楚開門營業第一餐為什麼會有這種狀況😅）
主餐肉類品質還不錯  但肋眼有點過熟外層有點乾  相較下來牛小排比較值得點
配菜有花椰菜菇類和一點薯泥
套餐加$700有半隻龍蝦  肉質飽滿Q彈多汁
假日中午沒有商業午餐  6人用餐加上服務費約$12000
價格對上餐點品質  應該可以有更好的選擇

另外比較在意的一點是服務生素質好像不太夠
上餐的時候都沒有介紹餐點
詢問牛排要不要沾醬  手上餐盤有三個罐子卻不主動介紹分別是哪幾種  問了才講
一整個用餐下來  聽到別處收拾整理的服務生摔了三次餐具餐盤  實在是有點傻眼
結帳的時候也是給完信用卡才說有紙本振興券活動
用餐體驗老實說扣了不少分

（目前有google五星評論贈一杯shot的活動）","Many people recommend meals on the Internet
I specially ordered the holiday at noon to help my family celebrate their birthday

Ordered Niu Xiaopu, New Yorker, Riby Eye, Goat Chop
Former vegetable salad, bread, thick soup
(Originally a bit of clear soup, but after a while, the waiter suddenly came to ask if the supply of clear soup was insufficient. Can you replace it with thick soup?
The quality of the main meal meat is not bad, but the rib eye is a bit too cooked.
The side dishes include cauliflower mushrooms and a little potato puree
The package plus $ 700 is half a lobster meat full Q bomb juice
No commercial lunch at noon on holidays, 6 people meals and service fees are about $ 12000
The price of the price should have a better choice for the quality of the meal

In addition, the more concerned is that the quality of the server does not seem to be enough
I did not introduce meals when I went to the meal
Ask the steak, do you want to dip the sauce on the dinner plate of the hand, there are three jars but do not take the initiative to introduce which one is asked.
I heard that the waiter who cleaned up and tidelled after dining was a bit dumbfounded.
When I checkout, I also said that there is a paper revitalization voucher activity for the credit card
The meal experience is honest and deducted a lot of points

離捷運很近、交通方便，招牌也很明顯，不會讓人找不到。店裡氣氛舒適不吵雜，服務態度仔細親切。開胃菜等不但美味且令人感到十分新奇，主餐牛排美味多汁、豬排鮮嫩無腥味且調味細膩、龍蝦鮮嫩易食用，甜點也是令人賞心悅目；若是慶生活動，會提供特殊甜點。,"It is very close to the MRT and convenient transportation, and the signboard is obvious, and it will not be found.The atmosphere in the store is comfortable and not noisy, and the service attitude is carefully and kind.Apigly dishes are not only delicious and very novel.

Lobster is very fresh, but it feels not the same (the color of the shrimp brain is different)
The environment is very comfortable, full of dating places"
服務親切，有免費停車配合的停車場，來之前記得詢問櫃臺。牛排美味，戰斧豬排肉很大塊但不夠軟嫩，比起牛排還是差了一點，建議點牛排就好。,"The service is kind and free of parking. Remember to ask the counter before you come.The steak is delicious, the Tomahawk pork chop is very large but not soft enough. It is still a little worse than the steak. It is recommended to order steak."

"趁著來台北一趟，訂了這家朋友推薦的牛排館的假日午餐，用餐前著實讓我期待了好幾天⋯

午間營業時間到3點，供餐是到2點半
可能是我們當天到的時間比較晚，明顯感受到服務人員不是很耐煩，一直強調待會出餐會比較快，前後強調了三次，著實觀感不好😅（不過後來出餐還是等了一陣子⋯？
用餐過程中偶爾會有趕著收盤子的狀況🙄🙄🙄，湯品還沒有喝完就有服務人員伸手要整理但又發現好像還沒吃完又收手，當下稍微被嚇到

假日午間的set含沙拉、濃湯、麵包、主餐及飲料，甜點需要再額外加錢
🥗主廚沙拉 擺盤不是很有質感，而且菜葉蠻巨大的實在影響口感😩整體感受上跟自助沙拉吧的感覺很像；凱撒沙拉好一點，但吃起來也是普普通通。大概要加100塊換成前菜才會好一些
主餐的部分，羅西尼菲力牛排  經典的菲力+鵝肝+松露組合😎以這個價錢來說實在不貴
熟度上點了五分但吃起來覺得稍微偏熟一點 但是菲力的肉質軟嫩，吃起來風味也不錯👍
頂級肋眼牛排一樣點五分，熟度控制得剛剛好
份量很大，吃到後面建議搭配三種調味才不會膩口。另外旁邊的佐餐蔬菜都蠻好吃的。

整體而言排餐表現不錯，價錢也算平實，不過附餐的部分尤其是沙拉不是很有水準（不知道是不是午間套餐的關係）如果想要更好的用餐體驗，或許要點有1/2龍蝦🦞的套餐，把沙拉換成前菜，然後再加點甜點🍮才會讓心靈獲得滿足😂","Taking advantage of my visit to Taipei, I booked a holiday lunch recommended by this friendly steakhouse. I really looked forward to it for several days before the meal.

At noon, the meal is at 2:30
It may be that the time we arrived on the same day was relatively late. It was obvious that the service staff was not very impatient. I have always emphasized that the meals will be faster, and we have emphasized three times before and after. It ’s not good to have a good sense.
Occasionally, there will be a situation of rushing to close during the meal. The soup has not finished drinking it before drinking, but found that it seems that I have n’t finished eating.

The SET on the holiday lunch contains salad, soup, bread, main meals and drinks, desserts need to add additional money
The chef's chef salad is not very textured, and the huge vegetable leaves are greatly affecting the taste. The overall feeling is very similar to the self -service salad bar; Caesar salad is better, but it is also commonplace.It will be better to add 100 yuan to the front dish
For the main meal, Rosinfei Steak Classic Philip+Foly Liver+Todge combination is not expensive for this price.
The familiarity was five points, but it felt a little familiar, but Fili’s meat was soft and tender, and the flavor was good.
The top rib eye steak is the same as five points, and the cookedness is just right
The portion is very large. It is recommended to match three kinds of seasonings after eating.In addition, the meals next to it are delicious.

On the whole, the meal is good and the price is flat, but the part of the meal, especially the salad is not very standard (I don't know if it is the relationship between the lunch package) If you want a better dining experience, maybe there is 1/2 of the point 1/2 The set meal of lobster 套, replace the salad into the front dish, and then add some dessert 🍮 to make the soul satisfied"
龍蝦是吃過最好吃最甜的！牛排36盎司但烤得剛剛好！值得節日來慶祝的餐廳！,"Lobster has eaten the best and sweetest!Steak is 36 ounces, but it is just right!Restaurant worth celebrating festivals!"
牛排跟龍蝦都超乎水準，前菜跟甜點也令人眼前一亮，環境很不錯，價格是高價的。,Both steaks and lobster are beyond standards. The predecessor and dessert are also bright. The environment is very good and the price is high.
"Lobster and ribeye are really good
The other dishes are just at the average standard
The vibe is comfortable
龍蝦令人驚豔，牛排不錯
其他菜就是正常","LOBSTER and Ribeye are really good
The Other Disher are just at the average standard

12/18午餐。1.門口量體溫的不穿制服像來打工
2.出餐順序錯，湯先上才給冷菜，詢問之後理由一堆？
3.沙拉還在吃就上牛排，趕個毛啊，你們生意沒那麼好好嗎！拼翻桌率是不是
4.牛排冷的，就想問是放多久？
5.加價的干貝裡面是冰的，怎麼不直接給我吃生的？
6.開吃三分鐘才過來問要什麼調味料
7.切了第一塊突然說可以換牛排刀，啊中間是在合成專武中嗎？
8.結帳忘記我們有先預付
9.菜單都掉漆了還在用
10.服務生標準打工仔，收盤子也不先問，直接一個鬼影手幫你拿掉，來去無蹤，著實讓人覺得厲害。

收費那麼高，也不會問用餐心得，也還好沒問，整個用餐體驗令人生氣到可能會想把整個龍蝦缸打破。
完完全全不推薦，5000元的價格連500都不值得，台北市中山北路上的一代名店，弄得自己跟新竹品質一樣，要不要考慮收掉算了，其他最近google評論也說品質掉得一塌糊塗，看來是都沒改善。
--

回覆如下
品質變了，其實不是這篇才變的，可別忘了你們可是說我是第一位願意自費去店裡自己消費的部落客，甚至還推薦朋友去吃，其他部落客都是寫完之後也不曾出現過，我對你們的支持直到這次才徹底打破，看到回覆我覺得真的很灰心，如果開餐廳不能接受公評，動不動就要訴諸法律，或是暗示對方沒給錢才寫負面評價，那你們會走到這個地步其實好像也不意外?

你們做餐很不容易，但是花錢消費的消費者也不容易，如果你覺得評論讓你不開心，請不要備案，請直接告吧，我們也備有法律資源，至於你們暴露個資侵害人格權的行為，我們也已經截圖，希望你們把重點放在餐點為什麼讓大眾消費者感到失望，也請把留負面評價的也都告一告，加油好嗎?","Recommend friends to eat, the face is lost, please come on, please come on

12/18 lunch.1. The gate temperature at the door does not wear uniforms to work like a uniform
2. The order of the meal is wrong, and the soup is given to the cold food first.
3. Salads are still eating steaks, catching a hair, are you not so good about your business!Is it a pseudo -turn table rate?
4. The steak is cold, just want to ask how long?
5. The scallops that increase the price are ice. Why don't you give me a raw?
6. Open for three minutes before asking what seasonings you want
7. After cutting the first piece, I suddenly said that it can be changed to a bull knife. Is it in the middle of synthesis?
8. Forgot to pay for the checkout, we have prepaid first
9. The menu is painted
10. The waiter's standard migrant worker, do not ask first, take a ghost shadow to help you take it away, and there is no trace. It really makes people feel good.

The charge is so high, and I do n’t ask the meal experience. Fortunately, I did n’t ask. The entire dining experience is so angry that I may want to break the entire lobster tank.
It is not recommended at all. The price of 5,000 yuan is not worth it. A generation of famous shops on Zhongshan North Road, Taipei City make themselves the same as Hsinchu quality. Do you want to consider it? It seems that it has not improved.

Reply as follows
The quality has changed. In fact, this article is not changed. Don't forget that you are the first bloggers who are willing to go to the store at my own expense, and even recommend friends to eat. Other bloggers are finished. I have never appeared. My support did not completely break until this time. I feel really discouraged when I see the reply. If the restaurant can not accept public review, it will be resorted to the law, or it implies that the other party does not give money before it is not given money. Write a negative evaluation, then you will go to this point that it seems that it doesn't seem to be surprised?

It is not easy for you to eat meals, but it is not easy for consumers to spend money. If you think comments make you unhappy, please do not record it. Please tell me directly. We also have legal resources. We have also taken a screenshot of the behavior of power. I hope that if you put the focus on the meal, why do you disappoint Volkswagen consumers? Please also tell all those who have been reserved negatively."
"服務細緻，不輸給五星國際飯店
食材使用與搭配相當有創意
雖是商業午餐但牛排炙烤的技巧好似一客要價2500的套餐👍
會再帶家人前往 …","The service is meticulous, not lost to the five -star international hotel

"非常好的用餐體驗
從環境、服務、餐點都很滿意
每道菜色都很用心的設計，融合台灣在地特色，不僅外觀華麗，味道也毫不遜色
壽星贈送的甜點很有誠意，寓意也很棒
很適合各種節日慶祝的餐廳～","Very good dining experience
I am very satisfied with the environment, service, and meals
Each dish is designed with a very careful design, integrating Taiwan's local characteristics, not only gorgeous appearance, but also not inferior to the taste.
The desserts presented by Shouxing are very sincere, and the meaning is also great
It is very suitable for restaurants to celebrate all kinds of festivals ~"
結合在地美食與法式料理的工法與精神，創意十足的新西式餐飲，不論是前菜、湯品、牛排/龍蝦主餐、甜點，都可以品嘗到主廚的用心，絕對值得一去再去的好餐廳！,"Combined with the work and spirit of local cuisine and French cuisine, creative New Western -style catering, whether it is anterior dish, soup, steak/lobster main meals, desserts, you can taste the chef's intentions. Good restaurant!"
整體餐點，每一道都精緻，點了伊比利豬、老饕肋眼牛排，二者口感，味道都很喜歡，適合家庭聚餐或慶生。,"The overall meal, each of which is exquisite, ordered the Ibilia pig, the old ribs of the eye steak. The taste of the two and the taste are very favorite. It is suitable for family dinner or birthday."
"大約在兩年前，第一次吃到這家餐廳。
見識淺薄的我真是大開眼界，第一次體會到如此令人驚豔的餐廳。
從此舉凡慶生慶祝，都會指名要來1852。
第一次用餐時嚐到了特色台菜的開胃菜棺材板，還有之後用餐嚐到了宜蘭特色糕渣。將台灣特色料理精緻的轉化到西餐，又完美的融入在餐點組合當中，這些特色前菜可以說是每次用餐最期待的驚喜了。
過去也曾品嚐到虱目魚澄清湯，利用虹吸原理真空過濾的過程，除了美味以外更添加了視覺享受。
主菜我一向選擇煎得外酥內嫩的紐約客，扎實的口感配上紐約客獨有的油脂。牛排入口之後的衝擊，毫無疑問地宣告，他就是在那些精緻的前菜鋪墊之後登場的真正主角。
因為時常在餐廳替家人慶生，因此也吃了不少次生日的特色招待餐點。
第一次嚐到了令人難忘的雞尾酒，之後嚐到的竟然是透過液態氮在桌邊製作的台灣古早味椪糖。這一系列的用心程度，一套台西交融的套餐，各種視覺與味覺的完美饗宴，彷彿是經歷一場在餐桌上的精采演出。這些特色造就了貴餐廳在我心目中的西餐霸主地位。之後也光顧過數家相同價位的西餐廳，但沒有一間能帶給我相同滿足的體驗感。

但在前些日子久違的光顧後，非常遺憾的貴餐廳已經失去了上述所有令人愉快的用餐體驗。可以想像菜單的更動大概是因應疫情變化，餐廳勢必要作出調整，雖然用餐前看了菜單有點心理準備了，但失去特色台菜的前菜還是令人非常失望。
而更嚴重的問題還是在於同桌親友的餐點溫度不一，甚至有主菜、湯品是冷的。當時像服務生提出問題後有詢問是否要協助加熱，但剛出爐的新鮮現做餐點一但冷掉帶來的影響是不可逆的，特別是主菜的牛排。熟度跟口感都會大大的不同。我較幸運我的餐點都是熱騰騰的上桌，但也並沒有因此得到更佳的用餐體驗。紐約客的調味似乎與以前不同，我也清楚紐約客的特色在於扎實的口感，但那天品嚐到的紐約客，可以說是味如嚼蠟，口感硬實缺乏味道，甚至沒有紐約客最為特色的側邊油脂。麵包上桌後過往是熱騰騰的，處於一個不燙手、最適合品嚐的溫度。但這次的麵包是一個不冷不熱的狀態，微微的具有一些溫度而已。且上桌時未主動提供奶油是當天對服務最失望的部分。
過往上主菜時會主動將客人的餐刀替換成牛排刀，這次主動詢問才得到，也連帶發生了刀子掉在我手上的失誤。所幸當日穿著厚實沒有受傷，因此當下並無介意。但除服務生外亦有一名像是經理的人員在旁，卻都未曾關心客人受傷狀況。除了服務外，危安態度應該也需加強。
最後是作為生日招待的甜點，是一塊普通的起司蛋糕，味道上也無特別突出之處。與過往的雞尾酒、椪糖比起來顯得敷衍了事，味道上、呈現上都有失水準。
最後在慶生的失望、痛心之餘，寫下這些文字，希望你們可以從字裡行間感受到我的高度期待以及失望落差。並期望未來有一天能再次回到那樣美好的「綻1852」用餐，重新體驗那曾經的美好饗宴。","About two years ago, I ate this restaurant for the first time.
I was so eye -catching, and for the first time, I realized such a amazing restaurant.
From then on, the celebration and celebration will be named 1852.
I tasted the appetizer coffin board of special Taiwanese dishes during the first meal, and then I tasted Yilan's specialty cake residue after the meal.The exquisite dishes of Taiwan to Western food are perfectly integrated into the combination of meals. These pre -dishes can be said to be the most anticipated surprise at each meal.
In the past, I also tasted the soup of milkfish clarification. The process of using siphon primary vacuum filtration, in addition to deliciousness, added visual enjoyment.
I have always chose to be fried and crispy New Yorkers, and my solid taste is matched with the unique oil of New Yorkers.The impact after the steak entrance has no doubt that he is the real protagonist who appeared after the exquisite frontal dishes.
Because I often celebrate my family in the restaurant, I also ate a lot of their birthdays for entertaining meals.
For the first time, I tasted the unforgettable cocktail, and then tasted the ancient early flavors of Taiwan made by liquid nitrogen at the table through liquid nitrogen.The degree of intentions of this series, a set of meals blended with Taiwan West, a perfect feast of various visual and taste, as if it was a wonderful performance on the table.These characteristics have created the position of Western federal overwhelming in my mind.After that, I also patronized several western restaurants at the same price, but none of them could bring me the same sense of experience.

But after a long -lost patron of a few days ago, it was a pity that the expensive restaurant had lost all the pleasant dining experiences.It can be imagined that the more movement of the menu is probably in response to the changes in the epidemic. The restaurant is bound to make adjustments. Although the menu before the meal is a little psychological preparation, it is still very disappointing to lose the special Taiwanese cuisine.
The more serious problem is that the meals of relatives and friends at the same table are different, and even the main cuisine and soup are cold.At that time, after asking the waiter to ask questions, he asked if he wanted to assist in heating, but the freshly made fresh meal point that was just released was irreversible, especially the steak of the main cuisine.The degree of maturity and taste will be greatly different.I am fortunate that my meals are hot -served, but I did not get a better dining experience.The seasoning of New Yorkers seems to be different from the past. I also know that the New Yorker's characteristics are the solid taste, but the New Yorkers who tasted that day can be said to be like chewing wax. Border oil.After the bread was served, it was hot in the past.But this time the bread is a state of not cold or hot, and it has some temperature slightly.And did not take the initiative to provide cream when serving as the table was the most disappointed part of the service.
When I went up the main cuisine, I would actively replace the guest's knife with a steak knife. This time I took the initiative to get it, and even the error of falling on my hand with a knife was taken with a knife.Fortunately, I was wearing thick and not injured that day, so I didn't mind now.However, there was a person who like a manager beside the waiter, but he never cared for the injury of the guests.In addition to service, the dangerous attitude should also be strengthened.
Finally, as a dessert for birthday, it is an ordinary cheese cake, and there is no particular prominent taste on the taste.Compared with the past cocktails and sugar, it looks perfunctory, and it has a level loss in taste and presentation.
Finally, after the disappointment and sadness of the birthday, write down these words. I hope you can feel my high expectations and disappointment gaps from the lines.It is expected that one day in the future, you can return to such a beautiful ""Bloom 1852"" dining and experience the beautiful feast."
超用心又精緻的西餐廳~今天是幫老公慶生，從一開始台西合璧的前菜、虹吸製作的虱目魚清湯，到外酥內嫩的24盎司雙人份紐約克牛排~最用心的是慶生招待的澎餅~~悠閒慢步調的用餐氣氛，還有親切的服務員，下次家人生日會想再來光顧 ❤,"Western restaurants with super -intentional and exquisiteness ~ Today is to help her husband celebrate their birthday.

"牛肉和龍蝦不錯,但最後加購$180的蘋果塔讓人驚嚇(不是驚豔),比咖啡店的小蛋糕還不值，這道派皮加蘋果屑可以下架了","Beef and lobster are good, but the apple tower of the $ 180 in the end is shocking (not amazing). It is not worth it than the small cake in the coffee shop."

肋眼跟牛小排處理得恰到好處  口感還在  肉質美味  加點的鴨肝入口即化   超好吃🤤 …,The rib eye and the cow small row are processed just right.
"最近大打廣告：「超值套餐，開放全時段也可以點到，不再只限定平日，假日及晚餐也可以點得到，活動截止日期只到10/31」。
一個禮拜便期待的訂位，想說可以跟朋友一個可以吃到牛小排配龍蝦商業海陸套餐，另一個可以點一般套餐的老饕牛排來嚐嚐！😋😋😋（⬅️坐下來前的心情都是如此）

10/30（二）晚上，
服務員老練的說「如果是參考網路上的商業套餐廣告來的話，不好意思，今天商業套餐都賣得差不多囉！只剩一些品項，請直接參考我們後面的菜單」
客人：「只剩一些品項的意思是？」
服務員：「就是..嗯..剩這個像松露野菇義大利細扁麵、咖哩牛肉燉飯..」（我的感受聽起來較支吾其詞）
客人：「所以只剩義大利麵，商業套餐這邊的肉品都賣完了，剩後面這些一般的品項是嗎」
服務員：「嗯，對的，因為廚房品項準備不夠的關係」

客人：「所以你們有一般套餐的美國舒肥牛小排，但沒有商業套餐的美國舒肥牛小排？」
服務員：「嗯..對的」
客人：「請教一下這兩個差異在哪裡呢？」
服務員：「一般套餐是10盎司，商業套餐是8盎司」
...

⁉️:所以你們有10盎司的牛小排，但沒有8盎司的牛小排？
❓：
慕雅室牛排名前來，最後讓客人發現只是讓人來的一種行銷手法？
若對自己的店有著滿滿信心，又何必打出這種沒辦法承擔成本的行銷呢？

後來要臨走之際，服務員又跟我們說：
「不好意思，現在廚房準備好商業套餐上的戰斧豬排與美國舒肥牛小排囉！」

抱歉，我不是花不起，
是不喜歡有種被欺騙的感覺，
後來只好把原本預計的花費拿去花在紅屋身上。

開店是為什麼？賺錢？分享美食？
是的，哪個開店的不是呢？
一個好印象把握住客人，成為長期的忠實顧客，
跟比起只是為了短暫的收益，把客人騙來就好，
哪個長遠的效益更高呢？

//店家回覆後

謝謝您留言解釋，
外行人的我們，就把戰斧豬排也當作是同樣的緣由囉。

期待一個禮拜，
當然感受就越深刻，
是我們可憐，不巧訂位選錯時間了，選到了中午客人很多的一天~","Recently, a big hit ad: ""Super value package, open full hour can also be what to arrive, no longer limited to weekdays, weekends and dinners can also be, the deadline of the event is only 10/31.
Out looking forward to booking a week, I want to say that I can follow my friends one can eat the beef ribs with lobster commercial sea and land package, the other can order general packages old steak to taste!😋😋😋 (⬅️ The mood is so good before you sit down)

10/30 (b) night,
The waiter old practice says ""If you refer to the commercial package advertisement on the Internet, unfortunately, today's commercial package sells badly! Only one item left, please refer to the menu behind me directly""
Guest: ""There's only one item left. What is the meaning?""
Server: ""On the Unh... Unlly, the portrait of truffle wild mushrooms, mushrooms, steering noodles, curry beef stew..
Guest: ""So only left-wing pasta, commercial packages are sold out. Do the remaining qualifications of the remaining parcel.""
Server: “Um, for, because of the inadequate relationship of kitchen items.”

Guest: ""So you have a regular package. The American comfortable beef ribs, but there is a commercial package.
Server: ""Um... vs.""
Guest: ""Ask the two differences in the qualification?""
Server: ""General Package is 10 oz, commercial package is 8 oz.""
...

!?️: So you have 10 oz beef steak, but the 8 oz steak?
❓:
Mu Ya Chao Cow ranked, and finally let the guests discover that only a kind of marketing approach is made to make people come?
If the shops are full of confidence, why should they beat out the kind of cling to take the cost of marketing?

Later, when I had to go there, the waiter told me:
“It’s sorry, the current kitchen is ready to go on a commercial package Battle Ax Pork Ribs and the American Comfort Beef ribs!”

Sorry, I don't get rid of it.
dislikes a sense of deception,
Later had to take Fertean to the flowers in the Red House originally expected.

What is the opening of the shop?Make money?Share food?
In tuned, what about the opening of the shop?
One good impression grasp the guests and become a long-term loyal customer,
It's better to swindle the customer than only the brief proceeds than only.
What is the more effective for the long-term?

// Originally reply

Thanks for your comment for the explanation.
For laymen, I have the same thing as a ax pork ribs as a dried pork ribs.

雙人套餐的紐約客牛排及龍蝦都非常鮮嫩好吃，前菜與甜點各有巧思，融合在地食材變化新滋味，環境與服務都很舒適，值得再訪。,New York steaks and lobsters of the two -person set meal are very tender and delicious. The predecessor and desserts have their own ingenuity. The change of local ingredients changes new taste. The environment and services are very comfortable and worth visiting.
牛排很美味，第一次覺得戰釜豬排這麼好吃，訂位時，還會幫壽星慶生，準備特別的甜點，很貼心,"The steak is delicious. For the first time, I feel that the pork chop of the battle kettle is so delicious. When the reservation, I will also help Shouxing to celebrate the birthday, prepare special desserts, very intimate"
"龍蝦吃的到彈牙的口感 讚👍
牛排今日點了肋眼16oz五分，可惜牛排較薄，熟度比較不一致，美中不足 …","The taste of lobster eaten to the teeth is praised 👍
The steak ordered 16oz five points today. Unfortunately, the steak is thin, the cookedness is inconsistent, and the beauty is not enough ..."
魚湯用蒸餾過濾的方式非常特別，清澈乾淨鮮甜，戰斧豬排大塊不油膩，最後加熱過的檸檬蛋糕非常綿密，餐廳氣氛好，服務很棒。,"The fish soup is very special in distillation, clear, clean and sweet, Tomahawk pork chop is not greasy, and the lemon cake that has been heated at the end is very dense, the restaurant atmosphere is good, and the service is great."
牛排美味、食材高檔，在這裡用餐令人感到十分享受。交通十分方便，捷運站很近，是朋友相約聚餐閒聊的好地方。,The steak is delicious and the ingredients are high -end. The meal here is very enjoyable.The transportation is very convenient. The MRT station is very close. It is a good place for friends to meet with meals.
"之前吃了一次幫家幫朋友過生日覺得還不錯所以這是家人生日又選擇了1852來做為慶生的餐廳！我們五個人的4個人點了商業午餐加龍蝦的套餐，另一個人是選擇其他正常的套餐，從一開始的麵包到湯品都很滿意一如往常，但這次來的前菜是一個半熟蛋加上一點勾芡的湯汁，大家有一點傻眼跟牛排西餐不是很搭,因為商業午餐的前菜是不能選的但我們有的人不大喜歡吃半生不熟的蛋,所以有家人因為不大敢吃吃了一半就放棄了！結果回去我們四個人點商業午餐的真的有兩個腹瀉跟腹痛拉肚子且拉了十幾次受不了還去看了醫生！在這個結束之後我們並沒有再吃任何東西!建議店家可能這一點要做改進因為如果這個東西是半生熟應該要有配套讓客戶做其他的選擇因為菜單上面並沒有前菜的內容只有寫二字 ""前菜"" !另外有一個小缺失就是我們的牛排有一個人是點的七分熟但是服務生送錯了他把七分熟的跟5分熟的牛排送錯人結果吃到一半才發現不對，點七分熟的肉竟然比5分熟的肉還要生，消費者從肉汁的多寡就可以看得出來，覺得這一點失誤是有點離譜，已經是一間頗專業的牛排店且單價也不便宜，店家要注意一下！再來就是這次牛排的配菜是一些敏豆跟薯泥這樣子2小小條杏鮑菇,端來時看到有一點覺得嚇一跳怎麼變得這麼廉價的感覺,覺得還是之前過往的擺盤會比較好有時候創意太多好像也不是那麼的讓人感到驚艷，反而會感到驚嚇比較多！這次吃的感覺沒有上次來得如此驚喜可能是失誤過多麼讓人感覺有一些失望!優點是確實是生日給的蛋糕是蠻用心的！但如果每次來都是一樣就覺得沒有驚喜了而且碰糖也很甜所以兩口真的就吃不下還好有5個人可以分！","I had a good birthday to help my friend's birthday before, so this is another restaurant for the family's birthday to be 1852 as a celebration restaurant!The four of our five people ordered a set of commercial lunch plus lobster meals. The other person chose other normal packages. From the beginning of bread to soup, I was very satisfied as usual, but the previous food this time was a half -cooked egg. Coupled with a little soup, everyone is a little dumbfounded with steak western meals, because the pre -dishes of commercial lunch are not selected, but some of us don't like to eat half -life -old eggs, so some family members dare to eat because they do n’t eat much. Give up halfway!As a result, we went back to the four of us to order a commercial lunch. There were really two diarrhea and abdominal pain and diarrhea. They couldn't stand it for more than ten times and went to see the doctor!After this ended, we didn't eat anything anymore! It is recommended that the store may do this to improve, because if this thing is half -life, you should have a supporting customer to make other choices because there is no previous dish on the menu. The former dish ""! Another small lack is that our steak has a seven -point cooked, but the waiter sent the wrong herself to send the seven -point cooked steak and the result of the wrong person. Seven -cooked meat is even more cooked than 5 cooked meat. Consumers can see from the amount of gravy. I think this mistake is a bit outrageous. It is already a very professional steak shop and the unit price is not cheap. , Pay attention to the store!Then this time the side dishes of the steak are some of the sensitive beans and potato puree. 2 small Pleurotus eryngii. When I came, I saw a little bit of scaring. How did it become so cheap? Sometimes it doesn't seem to be so amazing when the market is better, but it will be more scared!The feeling of eating this time has not been so surprised that it may be how many mistakes make people feel a little disappointed! The advantage is that the cake given by the birthday is quite attentive!But if you come every time, you feel that there is no surprise and it is very sweet to touch sugar, so the two really can't eat it. Fortunately, 5 people can divide it!"
整體而言有種歷史的溫馨，但不是過時的感覺，餐廳的食物、服務人員都讓人很滿意，尤其是鮮彈的龍蝦和火候控制得當的牛排，和友人用完餐會想再帶家人來享受一次。,"On the whole, there is a kind of historical warmth, but it is not outdated. The food and service staff of the restaurant are very satisfactory, especially the freshly bomb lobster and the preferably steak controlled by the fire. Enjoy it once."
肋眼老饕牛排不管五分還是七分熟，口感不同卻都是非常好吃，前菜及甜點創意十足，視覺效果甚佳！,"Regardless of the five or seven -point cooked, the taste of the rib eye is very delicious. The taste is very delicious."
"我是今天中午7月6號過去的客人，應該也是午餐唯一的客人。
中午其實沒什麼選擇只有商業午餐，純粹分享一下個人的看法。
我點的是海鮮義大利直麵。580不含服務費。
服務方面沒有話說，非常熱誠，細心的為客人介紹，這個給五顆心。
義大利的氣泡礦泉水給五顆星。
沙拉跟大蒜麵包部分坦白說不太行，雖然只是附餐不應該苛求太多，但如果有成本的考量我倒是建議乾脆不要付，讓客人付費加購。尤其是那個大蒜麵包，看起來一副病懨懨的樣子。
湯的部分，蕃茄牛肉湯，中規中矩還可以。
主餐海鮮義大利麵，八個蛤蠣兩顆干貝還有一小撮的蒜味義大利麵。
撇開份量不說，麵的調味還算不錯，蛤蠣鮮甜飽滿，這個給五顆星，但那兩顆干貝真的不行，一吃就知道是泡水發的，你們真的是在砸自己的招牌。
我不知道是不是因為只是商業午餐，所以沒有那麼細心。但是如果晚餐也是類似這種品質，坦白說我不會再去光臨。","I am the guests who passed on July 6th today, and should also be the only guest for lunch.
At noon, there is no choice but only a commercial lunch, so I will share my personal opinion purely.
I ordered the seafood Italian to face.580 does not include service fees.
There is nothing to say in terms of service, very enthusiastic and carefully introduced to the guests, this gives five hearts.
The Italian bubble mineral water is given to five stars.
Salads and garlic bread are frankly said that it is not very good. Although it should not be demanded too much, but if there are cost considerations, I suggest that I simply do not pay and let the guests pay for it.Especially the garlic bread looks like a disease.
For the soup, tomato beef soup is okay.
The main meal of seafood pasta, eight oysters, two scallops and a handful of garlic flavors.
Leaving aside the weight, the seasoning of the noodles is pretty good, the oysters are sweet and full, this two stars are given, but those two scallops are really not good. The signboard.
I don't know if it is because it is just a commercial lunch, so I am not so careful.But if dinner is similar to this quality, frankly I will not come again."
服務人員很仔細，都有隨時注意每桌顧客的需求，上菜速度很快，東西也都很好吃,"The service staff are very careful, and they all pay attention to the needs of each customer at any time. The food is fast and the things are delicious."
約4.5顆星，食材新鮮，生蠔甜美，牛排好吃 蘭姆葡萄青蘋果甜點也蠻特別的,"About 4.5 stars, fresh ingredients, sweet oysters, steak delicious Rim grape green apple desserts are quite special"
這次來是點羊排，軟嫩多汁，不吃牛肉的人可以考慮點這一道，點心+100換成蘋果慕斯，酸中帶甜的好滋味，蘋果中心有蘋果醬，搭配上慕斯，妙不可言,"This time it is a lamb chop, soft and juicy. People who do not eat beef can consider ordering this. The dim sum +100 is replaced by Apple mousse. The sour taste is sweet and good. Si, wonderful"
"牛排表現不錯 老饕很讚
但最驚豔的是生日甜點 很有創意 搭配令人眼睛一亮","The steak performed well
But the most amazing thing is that birthday desserts are very creative and eye -catching"
"平日商業午餐-美國舒肥牛小排$880
沙拉湯品平淡無奇，牛排非常普通，不推薦","Commercial lunch on weekdays
Salad soup is bland, steak is very ordinary, not recommended"
"一間西餐廳是否用心，從他喝水的玻璃杯和木製握把的牛排刀有沒有異味，就可以略知一二。

綻1852，真的是少數我吃到，這2樣物品都清洗的非常乾淨的餐廳。
有些餐廳，玻璃杯與餐盤混洗，都會有肉味甚至蛋味；木製把手牛排刀，洗完沒晾乾，會有二戰老兵的靴子汗味。

昨日去綻1852用餐，覺得餐點品質可圈可點。
牛排的烹調也恰到好處。
我點的5分熟12oz紐約客，連筋的部分也非常軟Q，絕對咬得爛。3分熟的羅西尼菲力表現也非常優雅。

放鬆溫暖的用餐環境，絕對是您家庭&情人聚餐，絕不踩雷的選擇。","Whether a western restaurant is attentive, you can know a little or two from the glass of the glass and the steak knife of the wooden grip.

Bloom 1852, really a few I have eaten, these two items are cleaned very clean restaurants.
In some restaurants, the glass of glass and the dining plate will have meat and even egg flavor; wooden handle stalling knife, not dry after washing, there will be the sweat of the boots of the veterans of World War II.

I went to the 1852 meal yesterday. I feel that the quality of the meal is remarkable.
The cooking of steak is just right.
I ordered the 5 -point 12oz New Yorker. The part of the reinforcement was also very soft Q, and it was absolutely rotten.The 3 -point Rosinfili performance is also very elegant.

Relaxing the warm dining environment is definitely your family & lover's dinner, and you will never step on the thunder."
牛排好吃！環境也很棒 可惜配菜普通 可是還是值得來的地方🙂 …,"Steak is delicious!The environment is also great, but unfortunately the side dishes are generally worth coming."
跟太太去慶生，除了前菜溫泉蛋溫沙拉比較不合胃口外，主菜、湯品、麵包以及招待的甜點都很好吃。,"To celebrate the birthday with his wife, in addition to the predecessor's hot spring salad, it is inconsistent with appetite. The main cuisine, soup, bread, and desserts entertaining are delicious."
牛排和龍蝦都很不錯，不過雞湯除了造型浮誇以外，味道普通的令人傻眼,"Steak and lobster are very good, but in addition to the exaggerated shapes of the chicken soup, the ordinary taste is dumbfounded."
生蠔、前菜都不錯，反而覺得牛排煎得太油，以這價位來說顯得有點美中不足,"Oysters and previous dishes are good. Instead, I feel that the steak is too oily. In this price, it seems a bit beautiful and insufficient."
超值的商業午餐，美味的牛小排、龍蝦，一家值得推薦的餐廳。,"Value commercial lunch, delicious cattle, lobster, a recommended restaurant."
"兩個人吃，一個人點特餐一個點普通套餐，特餐的龍蝦雖然只有半尾，但是兩個人吃還蠻夠的，很甜而且蠻大隻的。
牛排很多汁，但是因為前面有兩個麵包，牛排又很大塊，其實有點吃不下，幸好有三種沾料可以搭配著吃，才吃的完。
最後服務生服務真的很好，會一直注意客人有沒有需求，而且吃不同餐點都會清桌一次，真的很棒。","Two people eat, one person or order a special package for ordinary packages. Although the special lobster is only half -tail, the two people eat it well, sweet and big.
There are many juice steaks, but because there are two breads in front, the steak is very large. In fact, it is a bit ca n’t eat it. Fortunately, there are three kinds of dipping.
In the end, the waiter's service is really good. It will always pay attention to whether the guests have the needs, and they will clear the table once when eating different meals, which is really great."
整體的服務都很好 算是很典型的牛排套餐 針對壽星也有貼心的甜點 現在訂位也沒有之前困難 值得再訪,The overall service is very good. It is a very typical steak package for Shouxing. There are also intimate desserts for Shouxing.
氣氛很好，前菜干貝熟度很棒，主餐牛排是紐約客外層焦脆，裡頭熟度5-7分嫩且肉汁飽滿,"The atmosphere is very good, the previous dishes are very mature, the main dining steak is the outer crispy of the New York guest, the inside is 5-7 minutes tender and the gravy is full"
"主菜好吃，牛排熟度剛剛好
前菜尚可
推薦洋蔥湯","The main course is delicious, the steak matureness is just right
The former dish is still acceptable
Recommended onion soup"
服務人員解說都很專業，餐點也非常好吃😋，環境舒適，龍蝦🦞新鮮肉質Q彈，牛肉也是非常鮮嫩，非常推薦。 …,"The service staff comments are very professional, the meal is also very delicious, the environment is comfortable, the lobster is fresh, the beef is also very tender, and it is very recommended.Mowing"
"真心推薦，氣氛好 cp值高
壽星還有特別的點心～～～","Recommended sincerely, the atmosphere is good CP value high
There are special snacks in Shouxing ~~~"
很有氣氛，肉質鮮美，之前來過三次覺得很美味，但這次除了主餐外，其他都還好，不知道為什麼,"Very atmospheric, the meat is delicious, I feel delicious three times before, but this time, except for the main meal, I don't know why"
"真的是非常適合情侶約會 以及家庭聚餐等! 價格還有品質真的都超級佛, 另外分享一個這邊的隱藏菜單！蘋果派！真的要點! Best apple pie ever!","It is really suitable for couples for dating and family dinner! The price and quality are really super Buddhas. In addition, share a hidden menu here!Apple!Really! Best Apple Pie Ever!"

可惜今天的服務人員沒有上次的那麼有熱情和熟練","On the second visit, the cooking method is still very satisfying!IntersectionCrispy and tender inside!

適合情侶、全家大小來的餐廳！
推推推👍🏻 …","Super good service, enjoy steak and lobster in a comfortable environment!
Suitable for couples and restaurants in the whole family!

"食物還可以，但是價格非常高，如果要吃牛排全餐, 包含前菜, 湯, 主餐, 飲料的話，一個人的預算可能要到2500以上喔","The food is OK, but the price is very high. If you want to eat a steak, including the food, the soup, the main meal, and the drink, the budget of a person may be more than 2500 or more"
環境氣氛蠻好的，服務不錯，附餐飲料升級的紅酒也蠻順口的，只可惜了我這份舒肥的牛小排整塊都咬不爛，干貝好吃，整體的用餐體驗良好,"The environmental atmosphere is pretty good, the service is good, and the red wine upgraded with dining beverages is also quite smooth. Unfortunately, my comfortable cattle row can not be bitten. The scallops are delicious, and the overall meal experience is good."
食材、味道、服務都不錯，價格也不算貴，可以推薦。,"The ingredients, taste, and services are good, and the price is not expensive. It can be recommended."
牛排好吃😋，其它料理也美味，服務佳。 …,"The steak is delicious, the other dishes are delicious, and the service is good.Mowing"
牛排很好吃，環境、氣氛與服務也很好，生日有招待小甜點，會讓人想再二訪與推薦的餐廳,"The steak is delicious, the environment, atmosphere and services are also very good. There are small desserts for entertainment on birthdays, which will make people want to visit again and again."
"親子友善（四大兩小：2、4歲）餐點優秀
金質商業午餐：戰斧豬排、沙朗牛排三分熟","Parent -child friendly (four big and two small: 2, 4 years old) meals are excellent
Gold commercial lunch: Tomahawk pork chop, Salon steak three -point cooked"
菲力那個餐很好吃，上面的肝不會臭，羊排很嫩，生日贈送甜點一份,"Fili's meal is delicious, the liver will not smell, the lamb chops are very tender, and a dessert is given away from the birthday"
其實服務和食物都還算可以，只是覺得好像少了點什麼？,"In fact, the service and food are okay, but just do you seem to have a little less?"
"龍蝦很鮮
紐約客五分有點過","Lobster is very fresh
New Yorker is a bit overwhelming"
這次享用的是午間優惠套餐，牛排味道不錯，其他還好。,"This time I enjoyed a lunch discount package. The steak tastes good, and the others are okay."
牛排表面脆脆的很好吃，服務很好，線上訂位店家還記得是慶生很貼心,"The surface of the steak is crunchy and delicious, the service is very good, and the online booking store still remembers that the birthday is very intimate"

"【結帳金額請自己算清楚】
(一)用餐時間為情人節後，入座當下有告知套餐的蛋糕因情人節太熱銷所以更換銀耳湯或紅豆湯，有提前告知我覺得並無大礙。後來上菜第一道酥皮濃湯沒有""酥皮""，但隔壁桌卻有""酥皮""濃湯。詢問了一下服務員，服務員表示因今天的酥皮不夠出餐，故只能換成濃湯。好如果餐廳提前告知的話我是能接受的，但是服務員在點菜時並沒有提前說清楚，然後今日的""酥皮""不夠出餐？客人先來後到的順序不懂？要馬提前跟我說，要馬就生酥皮給我，而不是湯來了才跟我說沒有酥皮請您接受。
(二)飯後的飲料明明包在套餐裡面，最後結帳卻變成加購商品？足足多收了近百元(含多收服務費)。我可以接受飲料變成加購商品，但是最後上飲料時好歹你也給我兩杯吧(套餐飲料+加購飲料)。結帳人員說是當時點餐人員手誤輸入錯誤，那我想請問一桌7.8位的消費者會不會也輸入錯誤？
(三)酥皮事件有反應給當天的值班經理，經理只說確認後回覆，但一直到我走出這家餐廳他都沒有再理我及告知後續處理方式，看來此家老牌牛排館品質真的有下滑，領班的訓練素質是餐廳至上。以上是我經驗分享，我不會再回來消費了。","[Please count clearly for your own checkout]
(1) After the meal time is Valentine's Day, the cake that tells the package at the moment has changed the Tremella or red bean soup because the Valentine's Day is too hot.Later, the first messele of the melee was not ""meringue"", but there was a ""meringue"" soup next door.After asking the waiter, the waiter said that because the meringue is not enough for meals today, he can only be replaced with thick soup.Well, if the restaurant is notified in advance, I can accept it, but the waiter did not make it clear in advance when ordering, and then the ""meringue"" today is not enough to eat?Don't understand the order from the guests first and then?If you want to tell me in advance, if you want a horse, give me the meringue, instead of the soup, you told me that there is no plasma, please accept it.
(2) The beverages after meals are obviously included in the package, but the final checkout becomes a purchase of goods?Get nearly 100 yuan (including more service fees).I can accept the drink to become a purchase product, but when I finally go to the drink, you also give me two cups (packages+purchase beverages).The checkout staff said that the ordering person at that time was wrong input, so I would like to ask if a 7.8 -bit consumer would also enter the error?
(3) The meringue incident reacted to the duty manager on the day. The manager only said that after confirmation, but until I walked out of this restaurant, he didn't care about me and inform the follow -up process. There are declines, and the training quality of the foreman is the supremacy of the restaurant.The above is my experience sharing, I won't come back to consume anymore."
加點龍蝦真的有夠讚的！,Add some lobster to really praise!
"加分項目：
龍蝦是真的好吃
氣氛跟位置很舒適

扣分項目：
""舒肥""牛小排有些許焦掉(如圖)，刀子一敲是脆的焦炭感
不過服務人員立刻幫我更換新的牛排
可惜新來的牛小排 太油，香氣不足
戰斧豬排口味偏甜
洋蔥湯很普通
飲料很普通
餐點整體CP值偏低
碰糖確實很特別但實在太甜","Extraction project:
Lobster is really delicious
The atmosphere and position are very comfortable

Deduction project:
""Shu Fei"" Niu Xiaoliu is a little scorched (pictured), and the knife knocks is a crispy coke feeling
But the service staff immediately helped me replace the new steak
It's a pity that the new cattle is too oily, and the aroma is not enough
Tomahawk pig steak flavor is sweet
Onion soup is very ordinary
Drinks are ordinary
The overall CP value of the meal is low
It's really special but too sweet to touch sugar"
"如果有配合的停車場，建議服務生可以提醒一下怎麼使用停車券，以免要取車時遇到不知是要開上來再出示票卷還是先給管理員再取車？

今天行人出入口也不是說會經過管理員門口，我的理解是開車上來再給抵用卷或是繳費應該也可，因為要停車時管理員有給停車證。

結果要取車時卡在樓下出不來已經很困擾，最後還會被停車場管理員兇說要先給他票卷才對，完全莫名其妙

也因為車卡在樓下沒對講機，又是停在B3，通往一樓的動線也複雜，耗了很久管理員看到攝影機才開閘門，本來時間足夠，最後超時兩小被加收60$

停車場沒相關說明，管理員不會提醒要先給卷再取車，員工也不會提醒，等車出不來再看管理員臉色

錢是小事但整體感覺就是很差。

食物部分以這價位來說普普通通

服務生可能是新人還是太累了，訓練有待加強，餐點上了不會特別介紹，整晚就面無表情，少了份熱情感

總之這樣的消費體驗，加上停車的不愉快，往後應該也不會再來了","If there is a combined parking lot, it is recommended that the waiter reminded how to use the parking voucher, so as not to get the ticket roll or the administrator to pick up the car first when you get the car?

Today, the entrance and exit of pedestrians do not say that I will pass the administrator's door. My understanding is that it should be paid for the use of the volume or payment, because the administrator has a parking certificate when you park.

As a result, it is already troublesome to get stuck downstairs when you get the car. In the end, the parking lot administrator will say that you must give him tickets first, which is completely inexplicable.

Also because the car card did not talk downstairs, it was stopped in B3. The moving line leading to the first floor was also complicated. It took a long time to consume the gate to see the camera to open the gate. The time was enough. $

There is no relevant instructions in the parking lot, the administrator will not remind the roll and then pick up the car first, and the employees will not remind them that the car will not look at the administrator's face when they come out.

Money is a trivial matter, but the overall feeling is very bad.

The food part is ordinary in this price

The waiter may be a newcomer or too tired. The training needs to be strengthened. The meals will not be specially introduced. There is no expression all night.

In short, such a consumer experience, coupled with the unpleasant parking, should not come again in the future"
"服務生端盤灑出來並沒有道歉 並且灑進水杯內 只是換個杯子無補償水價格的部分 以及灑到餐巾紙也沒更換 桌上也沒清潔 這點就算了 今天用餐時 我相信餐廳早早就知道人數訂位等等會不會影響到上菜速度以及品質問題 我相信這是很基本的 今天用餐一道菜甚至等了50分鐘才來 並且也不是熱的 溫溫能入口的溫度而已 我認為這種等級的餐廳應該不會出現這種狀況吧 非常糟糕的用餐體驗 全家人來聚餐反而變成不歡而散的結果 希望餐廳能對此做出些改善或是補償
但有一說一 龍蝦跟主廚濃湯的部分是滿意的","The waiter did not apologize and sprinkled it in the water cup just to change the price of the water without compensation water, and the sprinkled tissue paper did not change the table and did not clean it. Will the order and so on affect the speed of serving and the problem of quality. I believe this is very basic today. I even waited for 50 minutes to come for 50 minutes. The restaurant should not have this kind of situation. Very bad dining experience to experience the whole family to get dinner.
But there is a part of a lobster and the chef's soup."
"舒肥牛排說實話很好吃，但以商業午餐1500-1800之間的價格，以高級服務、環境、餐點的品質來說，服務卻讓人些許疑惑。
喜歡吃麵包，多要了幾回，在第二回時說：要等主餐後上。好的，等待，但沒主動上，所以再要了一次後來拿到，因是麵包控又實在美味又再要一回，服務人員說：「你如果這麼喜歡麵包，你可以下去買...」後面補了一句「開玩笑的啦」
不是太正面的表達，如果續太多會可以尊重的表達無法再續，也不會有讓人聯想的「酸味」。
Ps:樓下並沒有麵包店XD
整體而言，餐點滿分💯！","To be honest, Shu Fei Bentes is very delicious, but with the price between 1500-1800 commercial lunch and the quality of high-level services, environment, and meals, services are a little confused.
I like to eat bread, and I have to take it a few more times. I said in the second round: I have to wait for the main meal.Okay, wait, but I didn't take the initiative, so I got it again later, because the bread control was really delicious and then again. The service staff said, ""If you like bread so so, you can go down to buy ... ""Later, I made up a sentence"" Just kidding """"
It is not too positive expression. If there are too many continuity, the expression that can be respected cannot be continued, and there will be no associative ""sour taste"".
PS: There is no bakery downstairs XD
On the whole, the meal is full!"
"可能我吃過的餐廳不多，但整體上並不滿意本次用餐
1. 餐點美味 ⭐⭐⭐
菜色頗具特色，可惜不論前菜或主菜的份量都很少

2. 服務人員 ⭐⭐
可能晚餐的來客數不多，用餐時都有被服務人員緊盯著的感覺很不好
慵懶的音樂與舒適的用餐環境，應該要讓客人更自在才對

3. 價格⭐
動輒近1500的主餐價位與2000元的螯蝦價格不斐
同價位吃鐵板燒或其他排餐可以有更好的選擇

4. 整體⭐
我吃到最後已經在看附近哪邊有居酒屋可以續攤了
若能再選擇一次，我會加價去吃茹絲葵...","Maybe there are not many restaurants I have eaten, but I am not satisfied with this meal overall
1. Delivery 点
The dishes are quite distinctive, but unfortunately there is very little weight of the previous dishes or main dishes

2. Service staff ⭐⭐
Maybe there are not many visitors to dinner. It feels badly that the service staff is staring at during the meal.
Lazy music and comfortable dining environment should make guests more comfortable

3. Price ⭐
The main meal price of nearly 1,500 is the price of 2,000 yuan.
Eating iron plate roasted or other discharge at the same price can have a better choice

4. Overall ⭐
I have eaten in the end where I have a izakaya that can be renewed.
If I can choose again, I will increase the price to eat Ruskui ..."
"光看店名就知道這餐廳主打牛排，若預算不多可選擇午間精英商業套餐，還可加價NT650元品嚐半隻龍蝦。
店內裝潢高雅、優質服務，不愧是花大錢嚐美食的餐廳！值得一提的是遮目魚澄清魚湯，此魚湯先經36小時熬製，上桌時利用煮咖啡的虹吸壺幻化出場，再佐以番紅花點綴，沒吃過的人可來嚐鮮一下！至於牛排、龍蝦、戰斧豬排也具一定的水準，韓式泡菜牛肉義大利麵的牛肉...相形之下就略遜一籌！","Just look at the name of the restaurant to know the main steak. If there is not much budget, you can choose a lunch elite commercial package, and you can also increase the price NT650 yuan to taste half a lobster.
The interior of the store is elegant and high -quality services. It is indeed a restaurant for spending a lot of money to taste food!It is worth mentioning that the fish soup is clarified. This fish soup is made after 36 hours. When serving, use the siphon pot of coffee to make a appearance. one time!As for steaks, lobster, Tomahawk pork chops, it also has a certain level. Korean kimchi beef's beef beef ... is slightly inferior!"
這個地方的氣氛非常好，非常適合約會。食物總體來說很棒但不是最好的。我們點了 24 盎司紐約牛排套餐 2 人份。我遇到的唯一問題是洋蔥湯。它嘗起來有些平淡和稀釋。牛排很不錯。他們建議我們買稀有的，它並沒有讓人失望。牛排又好又嫩，但我希望在像這樣的所謂高端餐廳以及我所支付的價格中它會稍微好一點。整體來說是一個可靠的四星級飯店。,"The atmosphere in this place is very good, very suitable for dating.Food is generally great but not the best.We ordered a 24 -ounce New York steak package.The only problem I encountered was onion soup.It tasted a bit bland and diluted.The steak is very good.They suggested that we buy rare, it is not disappointing.The steak is so tender, but I hope it will be slightly better in the so -called high -end restaurants and the price I paid.Overall is a reliable four -star restaurant."
"餐廳氣氛溫暖典雅有質感，讓用餐心情很愉快。服務算是進退得宜，不過還是有小細節要加強，用餐是有個人與雙人節奏的，尤其是西餐，不確定客人喜好的方式，建議還是多問問客人，不要先入為主。

先生點得紐約客16oz 5分熟，表皮有點脆脆的，裡麵粉嫩無血水，入口後肉汁滿溢，非常好吃。我的牛小排也很好吃，但吃過更棒的就回不去了啊！半隻龍蝦口感清爽，軟硬剛好，很好吃，半隻配上牛排剛剛好。甜點飲料中規中矩，表現如預期水準，沒什麼太驚豔的地方。

今天沒帶孩子，和先生享受大人的午餐，餐點棒氣氛也不錯，讓心情很愉快舒服。 (二人午餐約快$4000)。","The restaurant atmosphere warms elegant and textured, making the dining mood very pleasant.The service is considered as good, however, remanded that there are small details to strengthen, the dining in the rhythm of personal and doubles, especially in Western cuisine, uncertain customers' preferences, it is recommended to remand and ask the customer, not pre-prime.

The gentleman how to get 16oz 5-point cooked in New York, a bit crispy on the epidermis, the flour is tender-free, the meat is overflowing after the entrance, very tasty.My beef ribs are also very tasty, but eat more sticks to return to not go ah!Half a lobster is refreshing, soft and hard, very tasty, half with steak just right.At the moment in the sweet spot beverages, the performance is as expected as expected, and the scrapped too stunning place.

Today cluttering the children, and Mr. and Mr. enjoy the lunch for adults, the atmosphere of the meal stick is also very good, making the mood very pleasant and comfortable.(Lunch for two about $4000 faster)."
"整體感覺還不錯，美國肋眼牛排1852 ，加購龍蝦套餐1852（促銷活動），龍蝦真的很鮮甜，倒是牛排鹹了一點，幾乎可以不用加任何調味，一口龍蝦一口牛排頗爽口！
前餐大明蝦絕對是必點，不僅是味覺上腦，嗅覺神經也開turbo（宵南木煙），幹貝也很不錯。

不推：遮目魚湯，甜點青蘋果加價100還沒很好吃，有一大半都是慕斯。

從一樓環境上來其實沒有很有fu, 進門後才要感受高級晚餐的時侯，耳邊傳來的一堆吵雜聲，很像菜市場.... 🙄","The overall feeling is not bad, American rib eye steak 1852, buy lobster package 1852 (promotional activity), lobster is really fresh, but the steak is a bit salty. It can almost not add any seasoning.
The first meal of Grand Shrimp is definitely a must -have. Not only is it the taste of the taste, but the smell of the olfactory nerves also opens Turbo (Xiao Nanmu Yan), and the scallops are also very good.

Do not push: Covering fish soup, dessert green apple price 100 is not very delicious, most of them are mousse.

In fact, there is no FU from the first floor environment. After entering the door, you must feel the high -end dinner. A pile of noise from the ear, very similar to the vegetable market ... 🙄"

燈光美氣氛佳，服務人員貼心親切，老饕牛排肉質外酥內嫩，可以吃出廚師功力，現撈龍蝦肉非常Q彈，前菜幹貝很新鮮，酥皮濃湯也不馬虎，直到甜點熔岩巧克力和飲品都吃得出用心，是值得二訪的好店。,"The lights are beautiful and the service staff is intimate and intimate. The old cow's steak meat is crispy and tender. You can eat chef's skills. Now the lobster meat is very Q bomb, the previous dishes are very fresh, and the puffed soup is not sloppy until the dessert lava chocolate force You can eat it with drinks, and it is a good shop worthy of the second visit."
位置很好，很容易到達兩個地鐵站和多個巴士站。然而，停車可能會很困難，因為餐廳附近沒有任何可見的停車場。服務很好，工作人員對推薦和他們的專業都很了解。牛排準備得很好，配菜也是很好的補充。肯定會再次訪問。,"The location is very good, and it is easy to reach two subway stations and multiple bus stations.However, parking may be difficult because there is no visible parking lot near the restaurant.The service is very good, and the staff knows both recommendations and their majors.The steak is well prepared, and the side dishes are also very good.Will definitely visit again."
餐點有特色融合中式餐色形成套餐的點綴及襯托，並且不會產生對整體的突兀感覺，蝨目魚清湯的料理作法印象深刻並且不失風味，肋眼牛排外焦脆內軟嫩並且厚實的排肉讓主餐有很好的滿足感，非常推薦造訪！,"The meal is characterized by characteristic fusion Chinese meals to form a package and set off, and will not produce the abnormal feeling of the overall. The cooking method of milkfish soup is deeply impressed and flavored. The pads of meat make the main meals a good sense of satisfaction, and it is recommended to visit very much!"
"慶典在此舉辦，點了舒肥牛牛小排🐂

美國Prime舒肥牛小排，相當於和牛的A1級牛肉，油脂分佈不會太多。

A5很好入口，但油就好多，吃多了就會膩。","The celebration is held here, and I ordered Shu Fei Niu Niu Xiao Pan 🐂

PRIME PRIME Shuyan Niu Small, which is equivalent to the A1 -grade beef of Harbin beef, and the oil distribution will not be too much.

A5 is very good, but there are a lot of oil, and you will get tired of eating too much."
"2018.09.05=店面在二樓，是新開的牛排館。據說是雅室團隊出來開的，也算是老經驗的牛排團隊了。裝潢相當新穎，讓我喜歡的是，帶位的時候會故意把人群分散錯開，盡顯老牌牛排館高雅的態度，喜歡。

一開始的沙拉跟麵包，沙拉，就只是個沙拉，跳過。麵包咩....最近對麵包越來越有心得，吃麵包差不多就對這家店的水平有一定的了解。麵包烤得燙到無法拿起，配上了奶油，恩，整體來說算是不錯，但是也很難讓人叫好，5分。

洋蔥湯，牛肉湯底算是花相當時間去煮。味道很鹹，有濃鬱滿足的口感。上配上一塊焗烤起司的麵包，跟著湯一起食用，相得益彰。喜歡，少數喜歡的洋蔥湯品，6分。

戰斧豬排，份量不錯大，然後熟度掌握的是相當不錯。外面的僧帽肌肉質仍帶著血色，彈嫩又有肉的鮮味，裡面的里肌肉色全熟，嗯，偏乾的肉質。帶骨三層肉不油膩，又帶著很好的嚼勁，越嚼越有油脂。配菜芋泥普通，花椰菜倒是弄不錯，能輕易切開跟入口，6分。

老實說，牛排跟鐵板燒好像就是這樣了，受限於做法，吃起來感受都差不多。而且我對於沒有太多調味跟變化這一點，實在是沒有想多花錢來吃呀....

★★★☆☆ C/P值不功不過，還行。 De","2018.09.05 = The store is on the second floor and is a new steakhouse.It is said that the elegant room team came out, and it was also an old -fashioned steak team.The decoration is quite novel. What makes me like is that when you bring your position, you will deliberately disperse the crowd, showing the elegant attitude of the old -fashioned steakhouse, and like it.

At the beginning of the salad and bread, salad, just a salad, skipping.Bread .... Recently, the opposite bread has become more and more experienced, and the bread has almost a certain understanding of the level of this store.The bread was baked enough to be picked up. It was matched with cream. Well, it is good overall, but it is also difficult to make people applaud, 5 points.

Onion soup, beef soup base is considered to be cooked for a considerable time.The taste is salty and has a strong and satisfied taste.With a piece of bread grilled cheese, it is eaten with the soup, which complements each other.Like, a few favorite onion soup, 6 points.

Tomahawk pork chop, the portion is good, and then the cookedness is quite good.The muscles outside the outside are still bloody, tender and fleshy, and the muscles inside are fully cooked. Well, the dry meat is dry.Three -layer of meat is not greasy, and with a good chewing, the more chewed, the more fat.Paea -taro and mud, broccoli, can be done well, can easily cut the entrance, 6 points.

Honestly, it seems that the steak and the iron plate burning are like this. When it is limited to the practice, it feels similar to eating.And I didn't want to spend more money to eat for not much seasoning and changes ....

★★★ ☆☆ C/P value is not effective, it's okay.De"

很喜歡我的牛排套餐，但沒有空間吃甜點了！服務很好,"I really like my steak package, but there is no room to eat desserts!The service was excellent"
維持雅室牛排水準，餐點更有創意（尤其是遮目魚湯，令人驚豔）感謝外場服務員很親切服務又好，下次一定再訪！,"Maintain the level of elegant steak, and the meal is more creative (especially the eye -shaped fish soup, which is amazing) thanks to the waiter for the outside world."

來這裡吃父親節晚餐，食物很好，但不幸的是，我們四分之三的人因這頓飯而食物中毒。唯一沒有生病的是素食者，而且這是一家牛排龍蝦屋！這太令人失望了，尤其是當這家餐廳可能是我在台北去過的最昂貴的餐廳之一時。對這項服務也沒有留下深刻的印象。這麼高檔的餐廳，服務生卻很不屑，傲慢。,"Come here to eat Father's Day dinner, the food is very good, but unfortunately, three -quarters of us are poisoned by food because of this meal.The only thing that is not sick is a vegetarian, and this is a steak lobster house!This is too disappointing, especially when this restaurant may be one of the most expensive restaurants I have been in Taipei.There was no deep impression on this service.Such a high -end restaurant, the waiter is disdainful and arrogant."
有點高估和定價過高。海鮮和肉類的品質很好，但服務達不到價格標籤的水平。我的一份開胃菜上得不正確，主菜部分對兩個男性來說有點小。,"A little overvalued and excessive.The quality of seafood and meat is very good, but the service does not reach the level of the price label.One of my appetizers is incorrect, and the main dish is a bit small for two men."
