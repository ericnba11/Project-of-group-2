在台北這麼久，第一次看到這種價位的居酒屋（感動），這篇推薦給想省錢又想喝酒團聚的各位

🫕芥末章魚 80$
很便宜！不雷！可點
說個題外話，雖然聽說居酒屋都有特定配合的芥末章魚的供應商，但有一些居酒屋的芥末章魚的口感卻太硬或太軟´д` ;

🫕涼拌洋蔥 50$
🫕鮭魚卵炒飯 180$
味道算蠻清淡，但整體來講份量可以2～3人分食，鮭魚卵給的也算有誠意，越吃越香

🫕松阪豬水蓮 130$
水蓮份量很足，可惜松阪豬有點小油膩

🫕蛤蜊清湯 60$
沒什麼蛤蜊的鮮甜味，但這個價位也不好意思多要求什麼

🫕鹽烤櫛瓜 50$
算有水分的節瓜，但調味依然也不多

🫕日本生蠔 時價
🍺生啤惠比壽 160$
🍸天空之月梅酒 150$

總歸來說算是中規中矩（且便宜）的一家居酒屋，但如果想吃的精緻或更豐富的味道，那這家可能就不太適合，因為上次吃下來整體味道是偏清淡的～","#酒

Speaking of a question, although I heard that the izakaya has a supplier of mustard octopus with specific cooperation, the taste of some izakaya's mustard octopus is too hard or too soft.

5 5 🫕 🫕 🫕 50 $ $
饭 salmon egg fried rice 180 $
The taste is quite light, but in the whole, the amount of portion can be eaten 2 to 3 people. The salmon eggs can be given sincerity. The more you eat, the more fragrant

1 🫕 🫕 🫕 🫕 130 $
Water lotus is sufficient, but unfortunately Matsusaka pig is a bit small greasy

The baked item series is very standardized,
Baked hemp is also fragrant.

用餐日期8/10，原本是要吃隔壁的烤肉屋。因為賣完了剛好這次友人是「老司機」立刻就走進去XD~是一個有趣的店名老闆也很友善，一開始安排在裡面的座位屬於戶外空間搭棚子，後來開冷氣才慢慢涼起來，因為有熟客想抽雪茄一直問我們，所以我們就默默離開，老闆就幫我們打折扣加上說下次要請我們喝酒XD~也在外面默默聊一下

價位上在台北市來說算便宜的，生啤酒120、烤蔬菜45/串、烤雞肉50/串，大概常吃居酒屋的會覺得稍微便宜一點點

口味上點了很多串燒口味上都還行，沒有特別雷的點，但是也沒有吃了令人覺得這是這家店強項的地方XD~

"消費過兩次，一次是去年六月，一次是今年一月。

去年（還是前年我忘了）六月去店內吃串燒，價格偏中高但食物吃起來很普。吃完續攤換去吃中南街的店，天差地遠。

今年一月吃天丼，也是一樣吃起來很普，附的味噌湯甜到爆炸，甜到讓我懷疑到底是特甜的台式口味味噌湯還是鹽放成糖。

不要說我唬爛，我的訂單紀錄還在。

總之不會再去光顧。","Two times, once in June last year, once in January this year.

Last year (I forgot it the previous year), I went to the store to eat skewers in June. The price was high, but the food was very universal.After eating the renewal, I changed to eat the shop in Zhongnan Street, which is far away.

In January of this year, I ate the sky, and it was very universal. The attached miso soup was sweet enough to explode. It was so sweet that I doubted whether it was a sweet desktop miso soup or salt and sugar.

下班小聚好地方。裡面不像一般居酒屋的擁擠，很寬敞，也很乾淨，但不知道為什麼覺得好像沒空調很熱；食物選擇很多，可能沒有點到讓人驚艷的食物，就很一般般不難吃，但價格偏高，炸豆腐很好吃，但不是日式炸豆腐，反而有點像臭豆腐，還有泡菜，酒類選擇不多，有點可惜。,"Gathering a small place from get off work.It is not like the crowds of izakaya, very spacious and clean, but I do n’t know why it seems that it seems that there is no air conditioner very hot; there are a lot of food selection, it may not be unpalatable, but the price is not unpalatable, but the price It is high, fried tofu is delicious, but it is not Japanese -style fried tofu.
