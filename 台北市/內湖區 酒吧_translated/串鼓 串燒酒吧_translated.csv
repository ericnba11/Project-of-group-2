"很好吃
生蠔 大顆 烤完還是很多汁 好吃
但選項不多
不是很便宜
適合小酌配下酒菜 不適合吃到飽🤣
酒類滿多
現在有399暢飲 感冒好 要來去","Delicious
The oyster is large and the juice is still delicious after grilled
But there are not many options
Not very cheap
Suitable for drinking with wine and vegetables is not suitable for eating 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Full wine
Now there are 399 drinking a cold, it's better to come and go"
"正對面AIT晚上很漂亮，但太冷沒坐戶外，坐地下室有點悶。
原本站在門口等朋友來，但店員很親切請我先入座，也沒限時那些的問題。
炒水蓮很好吃！鮭魚卵炒飯也不錯，五花肉大蝦很有口感，其它串燒也都達到該有的水準。這次點Highball，感覺有點水，氣泡感跟酒感偏弱。","AIT was very beautiful at night, but it was too cold to sit outdoors, and it was a bit stuffy to sit in the basement.
Originally standing at the door and waiting for friends, the clerk was very kind to ask me to take a seat first, and there were no problems in the limited time.
Fry water lotus is delicious!Salmon egg fried rice is also good. Pork belly prawns are very tasteful, and other skewers have reached the level.This time I order Highball, it feels a bit water, and the bubbles and wine feel are weak."
"最近又有 399暢飲活動嚕... 所以 找了朋友 再來一次... 小週末 的 週三... 看來 內湖閒人不多... 這天客人沒有很多... 但餐點還是一樣美味... 這幾次到訪... 感覺 餐點口味，品質 都已經穩定... 網路點單系統等等也都上軌道... 外場服務 也是 迅速，有禮... 很開心 這住家附近有這好地方...
希望大家要常光顧唷...
另外... 感覺店家上菜，服務 速度都不慢... 可以點完部分，吃完再點... 這樣餐點才會在合適的溫度被食用... 之前 可能有些地方 上菜速度不定... 怕加點的 上得太慢... 但感覺這邊不用擔心這個... 一次點太多... 就怕冷掉 那美味度 就下降嚕...
=====
忘了 幾個月後... 俺來 三訪嚕... 這次 俺女友有一起來...
因為搭配 目前的 399 暢飲方案...
俺女友就把 串燒都點一輪後... 搭配 目前的 暢飲活動..
真心來講 餐點部分 ... 無懈可擊...
都很到位...
我前一篇 提到的 辣味的 調味粉 可以放到 桌上 隨時取用 比 放在定點 要另外去拿 這部分 還是一樣.. 要另外去拿... 但說真的.. 店家附的粉料 還不錯.. 也許怕桌邊都附... 就被浪費了.. 也許... 可以理解...
三訪後... 真的不錯... 唯一能說嘴 就是 菜式太少... 可惜了.. 要待久點.. 菜式多點 真的蠻重要..
另外 較高價的餐點.. 像 店內最高價的 肋眼牛排... 也許店家可以幫建議在 其他不那麼突出的餐點前 先上.. 幫忙插個隊... 才不會浪費了它的美味...
by the way... 店內主食 真的不錯...
俺女友 點了不少串烤..
但到了最後.. 我是把 串烤放著..
吃了炒飯... 主食真是不錯...

=====
一個月後~ 來 二訪~ 真的有進步呢~ 上次提到的網路問題~ 也有改善~
今天的調味沒下那麼重了~ 烤物就有感受到炭香~ 真的不錯~ 希望之後有多一點的菜色~
今天一樣沒有點主食和湯品~ 烤物 有很明顯的改善~
今兒較推 ...
#""明太子山藥"" ... 厚切真的夠味~ 上次也有點~ 不過感覺有點生... 這次 烤的恰恰好~ 讚~ 讚~
#""豬五花大蝦捲""... 這蠻特別~ 豬五花捲蝦肉... 蝦頭還串在前面... 還不錯~
其他的部分 也都有達到一定水準~ 蠻好~ 蠻好~

最後~ 不免俗的 還是要說說 需要改善的部分~
店家桌上似乎沒擺辣椒粉, 胡椒粉~ 環視了 一下~ 鹽, 辣椒粉, 胡椒粉... 放在店內一角~ 要用小碟裝過來~ 但小碟真心不好用~
辣椒, 胡椒 都不錯~ 好好味~ 對烤物真的有加分效果~ 如果 各桌可以 擺小罐用撒的~ 就更好了~ (這次沒用鹽巴, 調味還可以~ 但有些的確是有點淡~ 覺得不夠 也可以上點鹽)
上次提到 生啤要冰杯~ 這次有嚕~ 不過~ 不是那種 冰到冷凍的感覺~ 小可惜了~
但可能冰杯不多~ 我自己後面再點了 3瓶 瓶裝啤酒~ 有再跟店家要了一個冰杯~ 不過~ 第二個杯子 就沒冰了~ 不知道是不是生啤才有~
[以下問過店家, 有說之後會改] 網路點餐 真的可以節省人力~ 但目前 點餐一次~ 要用刷卡 就要 網路刷卡一次~ 要一直輸入卡號 等等資訊~ 店家是有提到~ 之後 會有實體刷卡機~ 就不用這樣 點一次~ 網路刷卡一次~ 不過 真心覺得 這個網路點餐系統 真的蠻有進步空間的~

=====
開幕第一天 就來嚐嚐鮮...
不好意思地說... 第一天的感受 真的是一般般...
Note. 我今天 沒有點 主食 和 湯品... 所以 以下 的感想 都是 烤物的部分。

品項 偏少... 也許是今天第一天... 之後也許 菜色會多樣化一點...
調味偏鹹... 有幾樣單純鹽烤的品項... 真的是 感覺鹹到 不配個飲料.. 會吃不下去...
有些品項 烤到微焦了... 雞翅 的烤前處理 還可以... 吃起來 蠻方便
但吃起來有點 焦味... 可惜了...
鹽烤鯖魚... 我也覺得魚皮似乎有點過焦... 所以 我也就挑掉... 魚皮挑掉後... 魚肉 還是有點鹹... 也許是本來就有醃鹽.. 又再多灑了一點...
整體來說 ... 第一天的感受是真的整體偏鹹... 調味真的可以改善...

第一天營業... 開幕活動 有 399暢飲...
這個活動 蠻棒... 不過 沒有冰杯裝生啤... 連第一杯都沒冰杯... 真的可惜了...

以下是 容易解決的小問題...
有地下室的位置... 舒適度 ok... 不過... 手機訊號不大好（我中華電信） 就沒啥訊號，又是全網路點餐，樓下沒放wifi密碼，這點真的不行。
網路點餐.. ok
不過 看不到 之前的點餐紀錄... 這點 就有點不方便... 不知道 可不可以 請 軟體供應商改進...","Recently, there are 399 drinking activities ... So I found a friend again ... Wednesday on the weekend ... It seems that there are not many idlers in Neihu ... There are not many guests on this day ... but the meals are still as delicious as delicious ... I have visited these times ... I feel that the taste of the meal, the quality has been stable ... the online order system, etc. are also on the orbit ... The outside service is also fast, polite ... very happy There is this good place ...
I hope everyone will take care of it ...
In addition ... I feel that the store is serving, the service speed is not slow ... You can order the part, and then order it ... This meal will be eaten at the right temperature ... There may be some places before I'm not sure ... I'm afraid it will be too slow ... but don't worry about this here ... Too much at a time ... I'm afraid that the deliciousness will drop if the deliciousness is cold ...
====
After forgetting a few months ... I visit three visits ... This time my girlfriend came together ...
Because with the current 399 drinking plan ...
My girlfriend will take the skewers for a round ... with the current drinking activity ..
Really, the meal part ... impeccable ...
All in place ...
The spicy seasoning powder I mentioned in the previous article can be placed on the table at any time. It is the same as it is placed at a fixed point. The powder is pretty good .. Maybe I am afraid that the table is attached ... it will be wasted .. Maybe ... it can be understood ...
After the three visits ... it is really good ... The only thing that can be said is that there are too few dishes ... It's a pity .. It is really important to stay for a long time ..
In addition, a higher price meal .. Like the highest -priced ribs in the store ... Perhaps the store can help the recommendation before other outstanding meals .. Help to insert a team ... won't waste it. Delicious ...
by the way ... the staple food in the store is really good ...
My girlfriend ordered a lot of skewers ..
But at the end .. I baked the skewers ..
After eating fried rice ... staple food is really good ...

====
A month later ~ Come on the second visit ~ really have improved ~ the online problem mentioned last time ~ also improved ~
Today’s seasoning is not as heavy as it is ~ I feel charcoal incense ~ It ’s really good ~ I hope there will be more dish afterwards ~
There is no staple food and soup today ~ It has obviously improved the roasted items ~
Today is more pushing ...
#""Prince Ming Prince Yam"" ... The thick cut is really delicious ~ last time it is a bit ~ but it feels a bit born ... this time the bakery is just right ~ like ~ like ~
#""Pig Five -Flower Shrimp Roll"" ... This is quite special ~ Pig Wulin Roll shrimp meat ... The shrimp head is also skewed in front ... pretty good ~
The other parts also have a certain level ~ pretty good ~ pretty good ~

In the end ~ I can't help but talk about the part that needs to be improved ~
There seems to be no pepper, pepper powder on the store's desk ~ I look around ~ salt, pepper powder, pepper powder ... Put it in the corner of the store ~ ​​I need to use a small disc ~ But the small disc is really not easy to use ~
Pepper, pepper is good ~ It tastes good ~ It really has a bonus effect on the grill ~ If each table can be put in small cans and sprinkle it ~ It is better ~ (This time, there is no salt, the seasoning is OK ~ But some are indeed indeed. A little faint ~ I feel that it is not enough to get some salt)
I mentioned the ice cup of raw beer last time ~ This time there is a cricket ~ But ~ It's not the feeling of ice to frozen ~ It's a pity ~
But there may not be many ice cups ~ I ordered 3 bottles of bottle beer later ~ I asked a ice cup with the store ~ ​​But the second cup is not iced ~ I don’t know if it is raw beer ~
[The shop has been asked below, and if you say it, you will change it after you say] The online ordering on the Internet can really save manpower ~ But now ordering once ~ You need to swipe the card once you need to swipe the card ~ Always enter the card number, etc. After ~ there will be a physical credit card machine ~ I don’t need to click it once ~ I have a network card once ~ But I really feel that this online ordering system is really quite room for progress ~

====
Come and try it on the first day of the opening ...
Sorry to say ... the feeling on the first day is really ordinary ...
Note. I don't have some staple foods and soup today ... so the following feelings are the parts of the grill.

There are few products ... Maybe the first day today ... maybe the dishes may be diversified ...
Seasoning is salty ... There are a few categories of pure salt grilled items ... I really feel salty enough to not be equipped with a drink .. I can’t eat it ...
Some items are baked until slightly burnt ... The chicken wings can be treated before the grilling ... it is quite convenient to eat
But it tastes a bit burnt ... unfortunately ...
Salt grilled catfish ... I also think the fish skin seems a bit overwriting ... so I picked it out ... After the fish skin is picked ... the fish is still a bit salty ... maybe there is pickled salt .. Sprinkle a little more ...
Overall ... the feeling on the first day is really salty as a whole ... seasoning can really improve ...

Opening on the first day ... The opening event is 399 drinking ...
This activity is great ... but there is no ice cup for beer ... even the first cup is not an ice cup ... It's a pity ...

The following is a small problem that is easy to solve ...
There is a position in the basement ... comfort is OK ... but ... the mobile phone signal is not good (I am China Telecom) there is no signal, and it is the entire online order. I don’t put the WiFi password downstairs. no.
Order online .. OK
But I can't see the previous order record ... This is a bit inconvenient ... I don't know if I can ask the software supplier to improve ..."
"味道不錯、偏鹹，
白醬明太子烏龍麵非常好吃。
但是服務真的很厭世，
感覺店員真的⋯⋯⋯很不願意上班，
價位是東區價位，在內湖來說CP值偏低，
明太子山藥兩片120元。
應該不會二訪，覺得去吃個飯，店員的厭世讓我倍感壓力，窒息感滿滿","The taste is good, salty,
The white sauce, Prince Oolong, is very delicious.
But the service is really annoying,
I feel that the clerk is really unwilling to go to work,
The price is the price of the Eastern District. In Neihu, the CP value is low,
Two Tablets of Ming Prince Yam 120 yuan.
It should not be a second visit. I feel that going to have a meal."
"衝著週三飲品喝到飽599元活動來，食物選擇種類不多，但滿好吃的；工作人員有些還不太熟悉服務流程，但很親切；599喝到飽不用全桌都點可以有指定駕駛，這點加分！
不過酒精飲料偏淡，可能會喝到變水牛才有感🤣","Drinking 599 yuan for the 599 yuan activity on Wednesday, there are not many types of food selection, but they are delicious; some staff are not familiar with the service process, but very kind; 599 drinking is full. Driving, add points!

"（內湖人真實消費體驗）
食材用的不錯！料理的也很好👍
環境也不錯 沒什麼油煙味！

內湖很缺這種真正有實力的店！
以後下班就來這了！

門口就有公車站，旁邊路邊也有停車格
重點是 還有很稀少的戶外座位！
這對戶外控的我來說，真是完美","(Neihu people real consumption experience)
The ingredients are good!The cooking is also very good
The environment is also good, there is no smell of oil fume!

Neihu is very lacking in this truly powerful shop!
I will come here after get off work!

There is a bus station at the door, and there is a parking grid on the side of the roadside
The point is that there are very few outdoor seats!
This is perfect for me outdoor control."

"不敢吃鮭魚卵炒飯也可以請店員幫忙調整，

超高規格的烤串讓人很擔心胃口會被慣壞耶🥺

寵物友善，室內座位需推車。另有室外座位。肉跟其他食材都很新鮮，調味也很棒！！推薦鹽蔥牛肋串跟山葵雞肉串。寵物也可以特製無調味的餐點。酒類也有喝到飽的服務。,"Pets are friendly, and indoor seats need to be strolled.There are also outdoor seats.Both meat and other ingredients are very fresh, and the seasoning is great!IntersectionRecommended salt onion and beef ribs to follow the mountain sunflower chicken skewers.Pets can also make a special seasoning meal.The wine also has a full service."

有別於一般日式串燒店，內用空間寬敞又舒適。好適合上班族下班來chill一下！,"Different from ordinary Japanese skewers, it is spacious and comfortable in the interior.It's suitable for office workers to come to Chill after get off work!"
明太子烏龍麵Q彈入味十分推薦～地下室沒有人的時候很不錯，可以開心暢聊（猶如包場,"The Ming Prince Oolong noodles Q bomb the taste is very recommended ~ When there is no one in the basement, it is very good when there is no one in the basement."
中規中矩的串燒，可以再大膽一些帶出外皮焦香的口感；松阪豬串的串肉方式很特別，香味足；不同於其他店的明太子山藥厚度口感很棒；牛雞的表現也很棒。內湖又多了一個吃串燒的好地方。,"The satisfactory skewers can boldly bring out the taste of the outer skin. The skewers of Matsusaka pig skewers are very special and fragrant; unlike other stores, the thickness of the Ming Prince Yam is great; the performance of beef and chickens is also great.There is another good place to eat skewers in Neihu."
新鮮食材處理及店內氛圍襯托下，讓我沈浸在一道道的美食饗宴，首推「鮭魚卵炒飯」「塩烤安格斯肋眼牛排」必點推推推🤫🤫🤫,"Fresh ingredients treatment and the atmosphere of the store, let me immerse me in a food feast, the first ""salmon egg fried rice"" and ""baked Angus rib eye steak"" must be pushed"

氣氛好、上餐速度快，餐點好吃，價格實惠，下次經過還會再來消費👍,"The atmosphere is good, the meal is fast, the meals are delicious, and the price is affordable."

"用餐經驗最糟糕的一次
吃過最雷的居酒屋無誤==
調味有夠鹹 也就算了
居然吃到沒熟還冷的雞心？？？
先上的菜都還是熱的 只有雞心是冷的
最後結帳跟店員好聲好氣的反應
結果得到什麼回應？ 「沒有熟嗎」
我們一點都不差那一點服務費的價差
一句基本的道歉都沒有！真的非常無語

整場只有剛進門帶位的店員態度良好","The worst meal experience is the worst time
I have eaten the most thunderous izakaya without errors ==
The seasoning is salty enough
Actually eat the chicken heart that is not familiar with?IntersectionIntersection
The first dishes are still hot. Only the chicken heart is cold.
Finally, the response to the clerk was so angry
What response to the result?""No familiarity""
We are not bad at all of the price difference of the service fee at all
There is no basic apology!Really not speechless

There is only a good attitude of the clerk who has just entered the door."
東西不錯吃！但出菜太慢,Good things!But the dishes are too slow
在家裡附近的居酒屋，整體外觀裝潢感覺很棒，路過很多次今天終於來踏店，服務人員很熱情態度很好，但食物真的是很不OK！以一個常常吃居酒屋的人來說，有的店可能會有幾道不那麼擅長的料理，不過我是第一次吃到點的每道料理都很不美味的店，炒烏龍太鹹、鹽烤雞翅沒烤熟、雞軟骨沒味道、明太子山藥不知道是原材料山藥的問題還是烤太乾的問題吃起來外圈有硬皮的口感…等，真的是蠻驚艷的難吃。,"At the izakaya near the house, the overall appearance is great. I passed the shop many times today. The service staff is very enthusiastic, but the food is really not OK!For a person who often eats izakaya, some stores may have a few dishes that are not so good, but I am the first time I have eaten every dish. The salt -grilled chicken wings are not grilled, chicken cartilage tasteless, the problem of the raw material yam on the yam of the Ming prince or the problem of grilled too dry. It tastes hard on the outer ring with hard skin ... It is really amazing."
"餐點好吃，炒的菜有水準，氣氛很好，上菜速度快，暢飲服務很讚，上酒速度也很快，完全不會因為是暢飲就拖拉，咦？你們真的有賺錢嗎，希望是有賺錢的啦哈
感恩~~祝福~~","The meal is delicious, the fried dishes are standard, the atmosphere is good, the food is fast, the drinking service is very good, the drunk speed is fast, it will not be dragged by drinking because it is a smooth drink, eh?Do you really make money? I hope there are money to make money.
Thanksgiving ~~ Blessings ~~"
"上菜速度慢的誇張！超過兩小時第一輪的烤物還沒上齊！
份量不多，調味尚可但肉偏柴，每人低消$350外加一成服務費","Slowly exaggerated food!The baked items for the first round of more than two hours have not been on!
There are not much portion, the seasoning is still available, but the meat is also partial, and the service fee is 10 % per person."
"大雷店請勿踩雷！The worst bar I’ve ever been to, DO NOT COME!(English below)懶人包：訂位出包、不尊重客人、上餐慢、不好吃，來了就是浪費生命
因為看到臉書上有世足轉播活動，本來前幾天打電話預約，但是到現場發現根本沒有登記到本子上（我很確定沒有打錯電話，因為接起來有說串鼓，訂位時也有留下電話、姓氏）然後店員勉強把我們帶位到「貼著電視牆的位子」，幾乎跟電視平行是要看什麼轉播^_^在家看就好啦～訂位時說沒有低消，現場才說一人要點到350🙃服務這麼差低消還這麼高，其他更有品質氣氛的bar低消也沒這麼高耶？最後還是給了面子點了外帶回家吃，店員說要等幾十分鐘，原本詢問是否可以坐在室內空位（店裡還有空位），卻遭店員趕出來「只能在10度又下雨的室外等」，且等了一個小時才拿到，吃起來也很沒特色，自己在家烤肉還比較好吃。不喜歡講重話，但這實在是浪費生命的一家爛店。
A few days ago, I had already called to make a reservation for the purpose of watching the World Cup broadcast, but when my friend and I arrived at the scene, we found that the bar was not ready at all, so we had to sit in a seat where we could not see the TV.  We decided to buy takeaways, but the waiter told us we would have to wait a long time but didn't let us sit indoors and waited. He asked us to sit outside and it was raining and very cold(10 degrees). Finally, we waited for an hour to get it.  The service attitude is very bad, don't come here.👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻","Do not step on the thunder!The Worst Bar I ’ve Everben to, do not comed! (English Below) Lazy bag: booking bags, disrespect for guests, slow on meals, not delicious, wasting life is a waste of life, it is a waste of life.
Because I saw a World Football Broadcasting activity on Facebook, I called the appointment a few days ago, but I found that it was not registered on the spot at the scene (I am sure that there is no wrong phone call, because there are skewers in the connection. There are also left calls and surnames). Then the clerk barely brought us to ""the seat with the TV wall"", almost parallel to the TV to watch what to broadcast^_^Just watch at home ~ It only said that one person was so high that the service was so high that the service was so low. It was not so high in other high -quality BAR?In the end, I took the face and took it home to eat. The clerk said that he would have to wait for tens of minutes. He originally asked if he could sit in the indoor vacant position (there was a vacant position in the shop), but the clerk was kicked out. The rain is outdoors "", and after waiting for an hour to get it, it is very unique to eat, and it is better to grill at home.I don't like to talk about it, but this is really a bad shop that wasted life.
A Few Days AGO, I have always Called to make a reservice for the public. at the bar was not ready at all, so we had to sit in a seat where we core see the tv. We decide to build takeaways, but the wait told us we would have to wait a long time but did not indoors and w Aited. He asked us to sit outside and it was Raining and Very Cold (10 Degrees). Finally, we wait for an hour to get it."
一進去是好的，包括環境氣氛 服務也很好，飲料也馬上就上，但去了1個半小時只在40分鐘左右的時候上了四串串燒，後面還有別的事只能先結單走人，店家有扣掉沒上的餐和服務費，觀察發現廚房只有兩人，烤台很小，店面座位客人明顯多於廚房能承接的比例，串燒算好吃，但顯然這樣並非長久能留住客人的營業模式，不會再訪。,"It is good to enter, including the environmental atmosphere service is also very good, and the drinks will go up right away, but after 1 and a half hours, only about 40 minutes, there are four skewers. After the order is left, the store has a deducted meal and service fee. Observation found that there are only two people in the kitchen, the baked table is very small, and the shop seats are obviously more than the proportion of the kitchen. It is not a long -lasting business model that can retain the guests and will not visit again."
Oh My God~這裡真是半年多來吃過最好吃的居酒屋！太晚發現的寶藏地～,Oh my god ~ This is really the best izakaya here for more than half a year!Treasures discovered too late ~
服務很好，口味偏鹹了一點，但各個菜色都很到位，層次分明且特色明確，推薦鮭魚炒飯，生芥末章魚，喜歡重口味的應該會喜歡這間。,"The service is very good, the taste is a bit salty, but the dishes are in place. The layers are clear and distinctive. It is recommended that salmon fried rice, raw mustard octopus. Those who like heavy taste should like this."
超推明太子烏龍麵！！ 而且環境很舒適 吃完東西 也可以喝個小酒 整個大推！！❤️,"Super Prince Edward oolong noodles!IntersectionAnd after the environment is very comfortable, you can drink a small wine after eating!Intersection❤️"
"烤功： 還不錯，但調味稍淡，如果只是讓客人加旁邊的胡椒鹽，有點浪費師傅對火候的掌控

環境：很舒服，冷氣很涼

整體：品項較少，單價偏高，但可能店租很高吧","Bakery: It's not bad, but the seasoning is slightly light. If you just let the guests add the pepper and salt next to it, a little waste of the master's control of the heat

Environment: very comfortable, cold air is cool

Overall: There are fewer items, and the unit price is high, but the store may be very high"
CP在內湖此區極低，烤串上桌幾乎都是溫的或涼的，雞心內的血沒烤乾腥味十足，雞軟骨有陳年冰箱的味道，骰子牛、牛小排吃起來像組合肉，評價令人疑惑的高？,"CP is extremely low in this area of ​​Neihu, and the skewers are almost warm or cool. The blood in the chicken heart is not grilled and dry. Chicken cartilage has the flavor of an old refrigerator. Like a combination of meat, the evaluation is puzzled?"
第一次來這邊～環境很舒適,The first time here ~ the environment is very comfortable
"氣氛很好，還有後面室外區，位置很多，室外區有罩著所以不冷。
員工的態度很好，老闆親切，東西也很好吃，很驚艷，是聊天放鬆朋友聚會的好所在。","The atmosphere is very good. There are also outdoor areas in the back. There are many locations. There are covers in the outdoor area, so it is not cold.
The employee's attitude is very good, the boss is kind, the things are delicious, and it is amazing. It is a good place for chatting and relaxing friends."
是我吃過最好吃的，服務也很親切，以後還會去,"I have eaten the best, and the service is very kind. I will go in the future"
"叫串燒酒吧卻沒有一個合格的串燒，
品項偏少，牛排硬，雞肉串幾乎沒味道，調味料居然沒有放在罐子給大家灑，還要用沾的。節瓜烤的都焦了...玉米筍兩根賣60...唯一能吃的應該是炒烏龍，要吃串燒不如去不遠的太鼓判","There is no qualified skewers for skewers, but there is no qualified skewers.

"Uber 宵夜叫了兩次(幾乎什麼都點過)，食物外送的情況下還是非常有水準，大推！

唯一美中不足的地方是竹籤都會刺破紙袋，導致醬汁溢出，希望這點可以改善。","Uber called twice (almost nothing else), and the food delivery is still very standard, push!

The only thing that is in shortness is that the bamboo sticks will pierce the paper bag, causing the sauce to overflow. I hope this can be improved."
