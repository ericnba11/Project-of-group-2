"據說在國父紀念館站附近有好幾家ABV，我們選了南洋風這一家，店面寬敞，特色是整面牆的各國啤酒。店員可以聽客人的需求建議，我本來是懷疑真有聽進去嗎？事實證明還真的是有的，店員端上酒來還會建議我們喝的先後順序，搭配菜色也很不錯。

轉回菜色，我們點了一個海南雞早午餐，海南雞看起來寡淡，但是吃起來雞肉味道不錯，配上醬料很好，特別喜歡蒜油飯，很搭海南雞。

烤牛肉很軟嫩，我立刻定位，隔天帶媽媽來吃，可惜隔天的烤牛肉就有點老了，但改點燉牛肉很不錯，當時點了生春捲也是獲媽媽好評。不過春捲個頭有點大，也不太適合剪太多段，老人家喜歡但不容易入口。

脆皮五花豬肉好吃，覺得跟牛肉不相上下，而且冷了也很容易入口不油膩。

有點雷的是紅綠雙椒烤魚.....這魚也太小了，而且幾乎沒什麼肉，是當天的敗筆。隔天的敗筆是炒粿條，醬油太甜太重口，粿條口感很硬，配上燙好的蝦覺得彼此格格不入。

這家餐廳的好處是不限時，店員也充足能照顧到客人，餐點上本來不能期待樣樣好嘛，下次有機會還是會來回訪。","It is said that there are several ABVs near the National Father Memorial Hall. We have chosen Nanyangfeng, the store is spacious, with beer of all countries with the entire wall.The clerk can listen to the needs of the guests. Did I doubt that I really listened?It turns out that there are really some. The clerk will also suggest that we drink the order of drinking, and the dishes are also very good.

Turn back to the dish, we ordered a Hainan chicken brunch. Hainan chicken looks faint, but the chicken tastes good. It is good with the sauce. I especially like garlic rice rice.

The grilled beef is very soft and tender. I immediately positioned it. I took my mother to eat the next day. Unfortunately, the grilled beef the next day was a bit old, but it was very good to change the beef stew. At that time, I was praised by my mother.However, the spring roll is a bit big, and it is not suitable for cutting too many paragraphs. The elderly like it but it is not easy to enter.

Crispy pork pork is delicious, and feels comparable to the beef, and it is easy to enter the entrance and not greasy when it is cold.

A little thunderous is the red and green double pepper grilled fish ..... The fish is too small, and there is almost no meat, which is the failure of the day.The defeat of the next day was fried juco. The soy sauce was too sweet and too heavy. The mouthful of the noodles was very hard. With the hot shrimp, it felt incompatible with each other.

"朋友超愛吃南洋料理
今天特別找了ABV展店第10間 #ABV南洋餐酒館
網羅泰國料理、越南菜、印尼菜、星馬料理等9個東南亞國
用世界精釀啤酒搭配東南亞美味，全新詮釋！

ABV有來自世界各國300種以上的精釀啤酒
搭配酸甜的泰式料理、越南菜真的非常合適
重點是店家非常有南島度假風
下班和同事朋友來真的是一大享受呀~

◼️泰式葡萄柚鮮蝦沙拉
開胃菜一定要點這道，非常鮮甜又帶有一點點辛辣感，是一道流傳近百年的泰國傳統沙拉，泰國的沙拉不會出現美乃滋或蛋黃醬，而是給你滿滿的酸味、鹹味、甜味衝擊！

◼️峇里島傳統鹽焗魚
峇厘島鹽焗魚選用鱸魚並在魚肉裡放進香茅、檸檬葉，再鋪上粗鹽在一起放入烤箱中焗烤，讓鹽焗魚有了濃郁的香氣和風味！

◼️蒜油拌飯
這一打開居然不是ㄧ般的白飯，是香氣十足的菲律賓風味蒜油拌飯！超級好夠味又香濃，單吃我就可以吃3碗！

◼️蝦醬龍鬚菜
不起眼的蝦醬龍鬚菜是我們一致認為最好吃的！鹹辣度條配得剛剛好，單吃就好好吃~

◼️印尼滷天貝
這是一種中爪哇滷製食物的料理手法，將豆腐跟天貝放入有蓋的鍋中慢慢燉煮，吸飽醬汁後的豆腐跟天貝軟嫩又入味，ABV比照傳統之外，再加入印尼甜醬油，讓整道料理甜鹹適中！

◼️傳統印尼參巴醬炒魷魚
參巴醬是東南亞的一種特殊辣椒醬，必須說真的有點辣！將魷魚清洗乾淨並切成適當大小的塊狀後放入長豆、臭豆再加入參巴醬一同炒熟後，整道菜聞起來超香的！

◼️泰式冬卡椰奶雞湯

看到這碗湯覺得好適合泡飯！椰奶味超級香濃，重點是裡面的料很多喔！將雞翅使用椰奶、檸檬葉、香茅、南薑等香料熬煮成雞湯並加入大量蔬菜，讓湯品多了點濃厚的奶香味和鮮甜感~

◼️泰式經典摩摩喳喳
我最愛的甜點環節！！這碗摩摩喳喳真的超大，根本是摩摩喳喳「船」！裡面有椰奶、海底椰、紅毛丹、波蘿蜜、蜜花豆、綠布丁條、椰奶冰淇淋以及西米露，飯後品嘗摩摩喳喳絕對是一大享受！","Friends love to eat Nanyang cuisine

✔️火烤沙嗲雞肉串：中規中矩的好吃，雞肉蠻嫩的
✔️菲式花生醬燉牛肉：因為一直沒給飯，味道太重，吃得有點痛苦哈哈。但肉是好吃的，燉的很軟嫩，很下飯，熱熱的配到飯應該還不錯？
✔️菲式脆皮烤豬：好吃！皮真的很脆、不是硬到嚼不動那種。是屬於高檔港式餐廳的處理方法XD

真的很久沒有好好放鬆一下😣

既然沒有辦法出門走走，至少也要「偽出國」吃頓好料吧～
一定要跟你們分享一個超級好消息，那就是！！
我的愛店ABV在10月份盛大開幕第10間分店啦👏
而且此次位在大安區的分店相當與眾不同，品牌這次「復刻」的是南洋地區的辛香料理，網羅泰國料理、菲律賓、越南菜、印尼菜、星馬料理等9個東南亞國家，光想像這些經典料理可以搭配上ABV來自世界各地300款以上的精釀啤酒，就忍不住口水直流！

✨ABV南洋餐酒館✨
新開幕的南洋餐酒館在裝潢上真的相當厲害！
溫暖的燈光明亮卻不刺眼，搭配各式木質調的擺設及南洋風格的植物及裝飾，彷彿直接來到南洋休閒度假Villa！
華麗中又帶點愜意，讓用餐的每一位顧客都能放鬆抒心的享用美食，真的讓我非常喜歡🥰

之前就已經是ABV的忠實粉絲了，對於他們的食物已經信心十足，不過這次面對我尤其喜愛的東南亞料理時，又偷偷的抱有更高期望！
期待主廚可以端出更讓我驚艷的料理，即使不用出國也能嚐到最為道地的美食❤️

🥗泰式皮蛋海鮮沙拉
這款沙拉相當清爽開胃！
內含花枝及鮮蝦，配上酥炸的皮蛋及特調醬汁，酸甜滋味又有些微辣度，意外的將食材完美融合在一起，多層次的味道及口感真的會讓人欲罷不能～

🥚經典越式豬肉蒸蛋
在蛋香四溢的蒸蛋中加入碎肉末及細碎的冬粉、紫洋蔥及蝦米木耳，不僅嚐得到不同食材的口感，它們彼此的味道更是相當諧合，最後配上是拉差醬的香辣滋味，在味道上真的相當豐富！

🦀新加坡式金沙蟹
炸的金黃酥脆的軟殼蟹搭佐鹹香的鹹蛋黃及蒜末，實在是讓人覺得太過癮！
軟殼蟹外酥內軟卻不油膩，吃完一隻不僅不會太負擔，甚至還會想要再次加點！

🐚越式羅望子風味酸甜炒螺肉
這道炒螺肉實在太深得我心！
新鮮的螺肉以酸甜的各式香料加以調味，鹹香清甜又微酸、微辣的醬汁可說是一大精華！
未將螺肉的鮮味蓋過，反而更加襯托它的美味，即使不愛螺類料理，也會被這道料理深深吸引～

🦐越南式甘蔗蝦
甘蔗蝦是以手打蝦漿油炸製成，完全吃得到食材的鮮美！
再加上清甜的甘蔗與檸檬葉碎，使得這款炸物不油不膩，酥脆又飽滿的口感真的會讓人念念不忘！

🍌香蕉煎餅
香蕉煎餅是我最為期待的一道甜點！
將烙餅先煎後烤至澎鬆，接著與香甜的香蕉、椰子絲、椰子風味煉乳及冰涼的椰子冰淇淋一起入口，酥脆的餅皮與入口即化的冰淇淋真的是絕妙組合，甜而不膩超級幸褔！

虾 Vietnam -style sugar cane shrimp
Sugarcane shrimp is made of fried shrimp paste, and the ingredients are delicious!
Coupled with the sweet sugar cane and lemon leaves, this fried material is not oily or greasy, and the crispy and plump taste really makes people miss!

Banana pancakes are the dessert I am most looking forward to!
Stir the pancakes first and then roast it until pine, and then enter the entrance with the sweet banana, coconut shreds, coconut flavor and refining milk and cold coconut ice cream.

"週末跟朋友來到這裡用餐，
共點了11點道
每道菜都適合當作下酒菜，
心中前三名燕麥蝦 肉骨茶和脆皮烤豬，

肉骨茶的肉一抿即化，軟嫩不柴，湯頭中藥味也不會過重，是一道適合冷天時喝點湯補暖身的極品。
脆皮烤豬的豬皮咬起來跟餅乾一樣非常酥脆，調味也不會過鹹，可以一塊接一塊，讓人愛不釋手，
