"先說總結：這是一家值得推薦的餐廳，若能再稍微精進，也有米其林餐廳的潛質，菜肴餐點不錯，本身是歷史建築，典型的日治時代街屋風情，本棟的泥塑裝飾較樸素，旁邊的（全祥茶莊）則有頗為經典華麗的泥塑，還保有美麗的山牆，再隔壁是老字號的南北貨（伍中行），希望給用餐的顧客一些歷史建築的資訊，讓用餐更加有趣更加有深度。
整體而言每個人1000出頭的價位可以接受，尤其是歷史建築的附加價值。
缺點：1.老式建築在樓梯處要注意照明，有潛在的危險性，我差點跌一跤.2.周五晚間7點點餐，咖哩雞及某些種類的啤酒已經沒有了，有些意外。
本棟建築在2023年10月11日指定為歷史建築
衡陽路早年為西門街及牌坊街，共同見證日治時期榮町繁華。60號店屋位於日治時期榮町二丁目，為1912~1915年臺北市區改築時興建三層店屋；建築材料鋼筋混凝土、木及磚等混合形式構造，建物內部線腳、泥塑裝飾燈座尚存，保有百年前的營造技術與設計特色；原有木構棧板大部分保存，前後幢採光井形成特色；為本市最早完成日治都市改正計畫，具現代都市計畫史特色。
３衡陽路榮町街區，四連棟形式店屋，基本建築架構尚存，於本區域實屬罕見，具稀少性。
從建築物保存的狀況非常好，騎樓的拱門，天花板，縱深延伸與前後段天井的保存都很完整，迪化街的郭怡美書店也可參觀到類似的結構，店內也巧妙地使用天井前的空間做為備餐的地方。
夏天喝啤酒非常舒服過癮，泰式料理每一道都很可口下飯，聚餐的家人們胃口大開！豆瓣炒脆皮芥蘭將肥豬肉的部分炸的酥香不油膩，女生也能接，特別點了一道炒河粉，是泰式的口味不是港式的，偏甜口，少點鍋氣，因為歷史建築應該是不允許明火的，所以我見過的歷史建築餐廳都是用電磁爐烹飪，就不知道Jolly是怎麼烹調這道炒河粉了！","Summary first: This is a recommended restaurant. If it can be slightly improved, there is also the potential of the Michelin restaurant. The dishes are good. It is a historical building itself. Next (Quanxiang Tea Village), there are quite classic and gorgeous clay sculptures, and there are beautiful gables, and next door is the old -fashioned North and South goods (Wu Zhongxing).

On the whole, the price of each person is acceptable, especially the added value of historical buildings.
Disadvantages: 1. Old -style buildings should pay attention to lighting at the stairs. It is potentially dangerous. I almost fell. 2. At 7 o'clock on Friday night, curry chicken and certain types of beer were gone, and some accidents.
This building was designated as historical buildings on October 11, 2023
Hengyang Road was the early years of Ximen Street and Torii Street, and jointly witnessed the prosperity of the Ryo -cho.The 60th shop was located in the dome of Ryocho during the Japanese rule. It was built a three -storey store house for the construction of the city of Taipei from 1912 to 1915; the construction materials of the reinforced concrete, wood, and bricks were constructed. Staying, retaining the characteristics and design characteristics of a century ago; most of the original wooden structure stack boards were stored, and the front and rear lighting wells formed the characteristics; for the earliest completion of the city's urban correction plan, it has the historical characteristics of modern urban planning.
3 Hengyang Lu Rongchichi neighborhood, four forms of store houses. The basic building structure is still existence. It is rare and sparse in this area.
The preservation of the building is very good. The arches of the building, the ceiling, and the preservation of the depth of the tower are complete. The Guo Yimei Bookstore of Dihua Street can also visit a similar structure. As a place to prepare meals.
Drinking beer in summer is very comfortable and enjoyable. Each Thai cuisine is very delicious.Douban fried skin and kale will fry the fat pork and the crispy fragrance is not greasy.

第一次在台灣的泰式餐廳看到一口包的開胃菜。泰國是用betel leaves （荖葉）來包，包料有蝦米、新鮮嫩南薑、烤椰絲、辣椒、調製過的蝦醬、檸檬丁、花生米，這邊改為用芥蘭菜葉包，吃不慣荖葉味道的，芥蘭葉反而比較順口。

而後，又詢問可否提供其他餐具等問題，一樣都得到極度sop的回覆。
其實，餐廳明明有碗，因為我們有點湯品，隨湯就同時上了湯碗。看到碗的同時，不禁要問稍早直接告知「沒有碗」是表示「沒有點湯就不提供碗」的意思嗎？

Then, asked if it could provide other tableware and other questions.
In fact, the restaurant obviously has a bowl, because we have a little soup, and we put on the soup bowl with the soup at the same time.While seeing the bowl, I can't help but ask the meaning of ""no bowl"" said ""no bowl without soup"" earlier?

"上個月寒流來，我們八點多到店裡，店裡開的暖氣還蠻舒服的，開在一家老舊建築物，後面有一個挑高的天井氣氛還不錯，燈泡色的氛圍很適合晚上喝酒的場所，因此這家餐廳選用了泰式料理酸酸辣辣的搭配自釀的啤酒很適合，洗手間就在3樓，雖說有點不方便，3樓還是有一個烹飪教室，看來一般平常時候也有開班授課。
今天點了幾道菜嚴格上來講還不錯，但如果站在一個正統的泰式料理來說，這味道上是有調整成台灣人適合的口味，也就是說以正統的泰式口味來講，減了大約20%的風味，但該有的風味還是會有，對台灣顧客來說還不錯，還可以接受。
酸辣湯酸，辣海鮮湯蠻適合台灣人的風味，可是對我來說酸味不夠，清蒸檸檬鱸魚，鱸魚雖然不是整尾的，他用的是鱸魚切片，但味道上總是顯得淡了些，檸檬風味可以在強烈一點，蝦餅還不錯吃，蠻特別的，是整條的，另外蝦醬高麗菜呢？蝦醬可以再重一點，因為我本身喜歡正統的泰式料理，所以在這一方面味覺上，需要強烈刺激酸要夠酸夠辣，點了一份法式羊排，法式羊排烤的熟度剛好夠嫩好吃這一道我推薦，的確是不錯，紅咖喱牛肉使用的是無骨牛小排口感細嫩紅咖喱風味柔和適中，椰奶風味強烈，因為有椰奶的襯托顯得柔和這道也不錯，尤其是淋上白飯風味更佳，如果白飯能換上香米，這就絕配，可惜。
最後的甜點，我們點了蘭汁芋香黑糯米跟摩摩咋咋，味道就一般正規正舉，沒有強烈的記憶點，這個環境非常適合飲酒，當然點了兩杯調酒還不錯.
現在的餐飲業真的是缺人手，還好沒有感受到很強烈的服務疏失，不過我們要什麼就要招手，換盤子也要主動說，人手不足沒辦法，主動招手要求，有需求跟他講還是會幫你做好服務的，整體來講還不錯只是泰式料理的風味可以在突顯更強烈，這是我個人的感想！","Last month, when the cold current came, we arrived in the store at more than eight o'clock. The heating in the store was quite comfortable. It was opened in an old building. There was a tall patio atmosphere in the back. Drinking a place, so this restaurant uses Thai -style cooking hot and sour with self -brewed beer. The bathroom is on the 3rd floor. Although it is a bit inconvenient, there is still a cooking classroom on the 3rd floor. There are also lectures.
Today, I ordered a few dishes to be strictly good, but if you stand in an orthodox Thai cuisine, this taste is adjusted into a suitable taste of Taiwanese, that is, in terms of orthodox Thai flavor, It has reduced the flavor of about 20%, but the flavor should still be available. It is not bad for Taiwanese customers and acceptable.
Hot and sour soup, spicy seafood soup is quite suitable for Taiwanese flavors, but for me, steaming lemon bass, although the sea bass is not a whole tail, he uses sea bass slices, but the taste always looks a little lighter in the taste. , Lemon flavor can be stronger. Shrimp cakes are pretty good. It is quite special. It is a whole. What about the shrimp sauce?Shrimp sauce can be heavier, because I like orthodox Thai cuisine, so in this regard, I need to strongly stimulate sourness and sour enough. I just recommend this. I recommend this one. It is indeed good. Red curry beef uses boneless beef steaks. The tender red curry flavor is soft and moderate, and the flavor of coconut milk is strong, because the setting of coconut milk is soft. , Especially the flavor of the rice is better. If the rice can be replaced with incense rice, this is perfect, but unfortunately.
In the last dessert, we ordered the orchid taro black glutinous rice and Moda. The taste is generally regular. There is no strong memory point. This environment is very suitable for drinking. Of course, it is not bad to order two glasses of bartender.
The current catering industry is really lacking. Fortunately, we did not feel very strong service negligence, but we must beckon what we want. You must also take the initiative to change the plate. It will still help you to do a good job. Overall, it is just that the flavor of Thai cuisine can be highlighted. This is my personal feelings!",False,0.153,0.026,0.821,0.9958

餐點好吃、服務親切、氣氛輕鬆愉快，唯一的遺憾(？)是廁所在三樓強迫運動好像也不錯😌衡陽店裝潢特別，中間有天井，甚至還有廚藝課程，有興趣可以聯繫看看！

✨環境：寬敞舒適，大電視隨時轉播運動賽事(當天聊到一半開始 F1 有夠嗨)有非常多大桌適合團體聚餐。可能因為空間很大、三層樓開放空間，冷氣比較不涼但可以接受

✨價位：約 500/人，吃的飽蠻平易近人

✨餐點推薦：我是第一次去但朋友是每個月都會來吃一次被店員記得的程度😆直接照朋友推薦的點完全無雷好好吃

1. 月亮蝦餅：長條形的蝦餅紮實脆口，還有台南會賣的那種零嘴蝦餅搭配，兩種我都愛

2.辣豆瓣炒空心菜：朋友特別交代要辣豆瓣配空心菜、蝦醬配高麗菜，好奇妙但真的又讚又下飯

3.綠咖哩椰汁雞：搭配的糯米飯裝在竹簍裡萌翻天，不只好看還很好吃。比原本附的白飯更Q就像芒果糯米飯的口感。要是這邊有單賣我一定點爆

4.涼拌海鮮：這道有至少小辣，海鮮有鱸魚片、花枝、蝦仁，搭配大量的洋蔥和芹菜

5.碳烤豬頸肉：朋友說碳烤類都好吃，我們選的松阪豬切面夠嫩表皮夠香。夾生菜再咬一口甜蒜有點幸福

6.精釀啤酒：99粉什麼字都沒看就選皮爾森。清爽夠順不會苦(我算蠻愛喝啤酒供參考)

餐前有招待麵包配咖哩沾醬，我明明在飲控(看不出來吧)但這餐直接破功大吃澱粉，每道都好開胃，減肥的朋友要慎入！另外分享覺得很可愛的是 Jolly 舉辦非常多優惠活動都蠻特別，像是從外縣市來附乘車證明就招待啤酒、週末18:00前入座也招待啤酒。非常可愛，這天吃的很愉快以後有聚餐還會想來！

The meal is delicious, the service is cordial, and the atmosphere is relaxed and happy. The only regret (?) It seems that the forced movement on the third floor of the toilet seems to be good. Hengyang stores are specially decorated, with a patio in the middle, and even cooking courses. look!

舒 Environment: spacious and comfortable, big TV broadcasts sports events at any time (to start half of the day, F1 is enough), there are many large tables suitable for group dinner.It may be because the space is large and open space on the three floors. The air conditioner is not cold but acceptable.

/Price: About 500/person, eat well and approachable

Recommended meal: I am the first time I go but my friend will come to eat once a month to eat the degree that the clerk is remembered.

1. Moon shrimp cake: long strip -shaped shrimp cakes are solid and crispy, as well as the kind of snack shrimp cakes that Tainan will sell, both of which I love

2. Spicy Douban Frying Channel: Friends specifically explain to spicy bean paste with cabbage, shrimp sauce with cabbage, curious but really praise and meals

3. Green Curry Coconut Chicken: The glutinous rice dress is cute in the bamboo basket. It is also delicious not only to look.More Q is like the taste of mango glutinous rice than the original attached rice.If there is a single sell here, I will definitely explode

4. Cold Seafood: This is at least small, and seafood has sea bass slices, flower branches, shrimp kernels, with a large amount of onions and celery

5. Carbon roasted pork neck meat: Friends say that carbon roasted is delicious. The cutting noodles we choose are tender enough.Take a bite of sweet garlic and then bite a bit of happiness

6. Cast beer: Petlson is chosen without reading 99 powder.It's refreshing enough to be bitter (I love to drink beer for reference)

Before the meal, there was a hospitable noodle with the curry and dipping sauce. I was clearly drinking control (can't see it), but this meal directly eaten starch. Each is appetizing. Friends who lose weight should be cautious!In addition, the sharing feels very cute is that Jolly held a lot of preferential activities, which are quite special. For example, it entertains beer to attach a car from outer counties and cities.Very cute, after eating this day, I still want to have a dinner!

建議可以點啤酒相關的料理，例如jolly德式豬腳跟提拉米蘇，都很有啤酒的風味，是比較推薦的品項。

餐點非常出色，沒有一道雷菜，調味沒有瓦城甜。
特別推薦他們的碳烤牛小排（460元）和Jolly蝦餅（325元）。如果不喜歡啤酒苦味的話，推薦他們的小麥啤酒。
用餐環境乾淨舒適，服務親切周到，沒什麼時間壓力。店內座位很多，無論平日還是假日用餐時段來，時常都還有空位，是臺北市假日難得好吃又不用事前預約的餐廳。
餐點價格合理，我們一人一杯啤酒，均消一人約750元。晚餐時段如果六點前入座，會送一小杯啤酒。如果跟臺北市的日式居酒屋相比，價位相對親民。

The meal is very good, there is no thunderic dish, and the seasoning is not sweet.

The dining environment is clean and comfortable, the service is cordial and thoughtful, and there is no time pressure.There are a lot of seats in the store. Whether it is usually or dining on daily meals, there are often vacancy. It is a restaurant that is rare and delicious on holidays in Taipei.
The price of the meal is reasonable. We have a cup of beer, all of which are about 750 yuan.If you are seats before dinner, you will send a small glass of beer.If compared with the Japanese -style izakaya in Taipei, the price is relatively close to the people.

這是一家走泰式餐酒館風格的餐廳，因為是連鎖店，朋友說之前在慶城店感覺很不錯，特地推薦來吃，不過今天選擇在衡陽店吃吃，裝潢風格都還算OK，唯一就是桌子太高，座椅太低，可能店家也發現這個問題所以在坐墊上又疊上一層椅墊，但是可能因為尺寸大小不合，老實說坐起來不舒服，可能因為名氣評價都還不錯，所以大部分都是預定座位，晚訂的只能坐這種座位了！

菜單本很大張一份，老實說其實點餐起來沒有這麼便利，也許是故意做成這樣的特色吧🤔！這次跟金童玉女情侶黨一起吃飯用餐，三個人點了5道菜，3個甜點，花費約21xx，其實價格上來說偏高一些，因為餐點份量其實沒有很大份，蝦醬四季豆的香菇有點乾煸，老實說我們吃不出來🤣，因為乾煸的程度有點像是乾貨的硬度。酸辣醬炒蝦中規中矩的水準都還OK，綠咖哩椰汁雞肉大概是比較好下飯的一道，不過比較特別的是隨餐有附上一份糯米飯搭配（第一次吃到配糯米飯蠻特別的），淺嘗輒止的吃了一口糯米飯的綠咖哩，就是多了一點口感上的黏稠度，其實也還OK。炭烤豬頸肉是這裡的招牌菜，搭配小餅皮吃還不錯啦！隨餐附上蔬菜跟醬汁，算是比較有嚼勁。再來中卷部份也還可以，只是有點炒過久一點，不然肉質應該更Q彈，最後甜點吃了嘛嘛渣渣，我只能說這家餐館的口味都有做調整變化，大概是為了迎合台灣人口味吧！🤔 而且廚師料理方法有點感覺偏熱炒類作法，大概是因為我沒有點主打的手工啤酒（因為不能酒駕🙄），有點可惜，我看了一下大家評論是啤酒好喝🤣，朋友則是說慶城店比較優！再次感謝金童玉女情侶黨作東讓我白吃白喝😛","#Jolly Bream # #Hengyang Store

This is a Thai -style restaurant style restaurant. Because it is a chain store, friends said that they felt very good in Qingcheng Store before, and I specially recommended to eat, but today I chose to eat in Hengyang Store. The table is too high and the seats are too low. Maybe the store also finds this problem, so it is stacked on a cushion on the cushion, but because the size is not in line, it may be uncomfortable to sit up. Most of them are scheduled seats, and you can only sit at night!

The menu is very large. To be honest, it is not so convenient to order meals. Maybe it is intentionally made into such a characteristic!This time I dinner with Jin Tongyu's female couple party party.
