"連鎖精釀啤酒專賣店 #掌門精釀啤酒 ，光台北就有多家分店，其中微風松高店4F的戶外露臺，環顧信義區百貨大樓，背景就是台北101，視野極佳，夜晚夜景更是絢爛，氛圍感拉滿，是朋友小聚、情侶約會的最佳首選！

掌門精釀的啤酒種類不少，將近20種台灣在地精釀麥酒，價格約$200-300元，也有無酒精軟飲和咖啡，台式下酒菜也是掌門的強項，至於炸物類就還好。

微風松高店有室內席，但座位較少，約10張吧檯席，一般人都習慣坐戶外席，容納30-40人應該沒問題。室外燈光美、氣氛佳，室內則可跟調酒師尬聊、吹冷氣，也是不錯。

"第一次遇到服務態度那麼差的店家⋯差到只想留一星評論👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

本來以為可能只是運氣比較差，遇到態度比較差的店員，沒想到看了一下Google評論才發現不是只有我這樣想😀
目前總共556則評論裡面就有58則一星評論、24則二星評論

除了跟我一樣認為店員態度差之外
大多都是講食物難吃、桌子上會爬小強🪳之類的評論

唯一能給好評的只有四樓望出去就可以看到101景觀

———分享一下12月週末的消費體驗———
之前聽朋友講過掌門的風景不錯 酒也可以
因此今天喝完 Fake sober 就來掌門續攤

到四樓之後有聽到店員說「可以先找位置喔」
就先讓朋友先去找位置，我跟另一位排隊點酒
結果拿到酒是紙杯裝的就算了⋯感覺容量還比原本用玻璃杯的少很多⋯價格也一樣 沒有降價

到戶外之後朋友只找到一張桌子跟椅子（但我們有四個人）

桌上的食物跟酒感覺也放很久了，都沒有人清理，請店員來整理之後，禮貌詢問有其他椅子可以取用嗎？
店員回答：「要自己找喔」

在平台繞了兩圈、一個一個禮貌詢問空位有沒有人坐之後（禮貌詢問指的是：都有「不好意思」、「請問」、「謝謝」）

但遇到的不是「有人了」就是「等一下會有人」
好不容易遇到一個「沒有人」的位子，要繼續幫另外兩位朋友找椅子（我們總共四個人）

結果遇到一組超級沒禮貌的客人
我：不好意思，請問這裡有人坐嗎？
對方：沒有欸，但我們要放包包
我：原來如此，可是包包不是人，我們有人，需要椅子
對方：你怎麼可以這麼理直氣壯啊？我們就是要放包包啊！你們不能站著嗎？
我：可是我們的桌子跟椅子的高度不太一樣，站著有點奇怪
對方：那你們就自己想辦法啊！
我：可是我繞了一圈大部分都有人坐了，而且你們只有兩個人，點兩杯低消，為什麼可以佔用三個人的位子？
對方：不管啊 反正這個位子我們就是要放包包
（位子上只有一個超級小的包包明明可以放桌上，硬要放在椅子上）

因此我到櫃檯請店員協助處理
也跟店家陳述我的邏輯：「剛剛外面有一組客人佔用座位，可以協助處理嗎？謝謝！店內規則是一人至少要點一杯低消，對方只有兩個人，只點了兩杯低消，但佔用了三個人的位置。我們有四個人，點了四杯低消，但目前只有兩個位置。」

得到店家的回應是：「剛剛有說要先找位置」

⋯

後來請店員協助到前面兩位客人那裡之後
店員非但沒有協助處理問題，甚至還幫腔對方說：他們有兩個人，也點了兩杯飲料，有達到低消

我：可是他們只有兩個人，但是佔了三個位置
店員：那我們也沒辦法呀！你們可以站著啊！
我：好喔謝謝⋯

———12月週末消費體驗分享完畢———

很久沒有在Google上打那麼長的負評
也是第一次只想給一顆星的店家⋯
總而言之就是很差的消費體驗，以後不會想再來","The first time I encountered a poor service attitude, I just wanted to leave a star comment 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Originally I thought it might be just poor luck. When I met a clerk with a poor attitude, I did not expect to take a look at the Google comment to find out that I didn’t want to do it.
There are currently 556 comments in the total of 58. One -star comment, 24 two -star reviews

Except that I think the store staff is not as good as me, the attitude is poor
Most of them are about comments such as unbearable food and climbing Xiaoqiang 🪳 on the table

The only one who can give the praise is only the fourth floor, you can see the 101 landscape

——— Share the consumption experience of the December weekend ————————
I have listened to my friends before that the scenery of the head is good.
So after drinking Fake Sober today, I will come to the head of the stand

After I went to the fourth floor, I heard the clerk saying ""you can find a place first""
Just let my friends go to find the location first.
As a result, it is a paper cup to get the wine cup.

After arriving outdoors, friends found only one table and chair (but we have four people)

The food and wine on the table have also been felt for a long time. No one cleaned up. After asking the clerk to sort it out, please ask if there are other chairs to use?
The clerk replied, ""Find it yourself""

After two laps on the platform, after a polite inquiry about whether there are anyone sitting in the vacant position (politely asking: ""Sorry"", ""May I ask"", ""Thank you"")

But what I met was either ""someone"" or ""waiting for someone at a time""
I finally met a ""no one"" seat, and we must continue to help the other two friends to find a chair (we have four people in total)

As a result, I met a group of super -polite guests
Me: Sorry, is anyone sitting here?
The opponent: No, but we have to put the bag
Me: It turns out, but the bag is not a person, some of us, we need a chair
Person: How can you be so straightforward?We just have to put a bag!Can't you stand?
Me: But our table is not the same as the height of the chair, standing a little strange
The other party: Then you can find a way yourself!
Me: But I have been sitting around most of them, and you have only two people, and you can take two cups low. Why can you occupy the seat of the three people?
The opponent: No matter what, anyway, we just need to put the bag in this seat
(There is only one super small bag on the seat that can be placed on the table, and it is insisted on the chair)

So I went to the counter to ask the clerk to assist in handling
I also stated my logic with the store: ""Just now there is a group of guests occupying seats, can I help handle it? Thank you! The rules in the store are at least one cup of one person. The other party has only two people. We have four people for three people, and we ordered four cups to disappear, but there are only two positions. ""

The response from the store is: ""I just said that I want to find a location first.""

Hunt

Later, I asked the clerk to assist in the two guests in front
The clerk not only did not help deal with the problem, but even helped the other party say: They have two people, they also ordered two cups of drinks, and they have reached a low consumption.

Me: But they only have two people, but they occupy three positions
Clerk: Then we can't help it!You can stand!
Me: Okay, thank you ...

#露天酒吧 #可刷卡 #可刷載具

🍺啤酒：
點了兩款掌門精釀啤酒，都很順口好喝，但其中一款溫度沒有那麼低的時候喝起來苦味稍微比較明顯，總之精釀啤酒拿到以後就是不要拖太久才喝完，不擅長喝啤酒的人請斟酌。

🍽餐點：
點了水餃和櫻桃鴨披薩，覺得都沒有很滿意，水餃似乎煮過頭了皮整個軟軟爛爛的，口感很差。
披薩的部分很像是冷凍披薩加熱，是薄脆餅皮，整體來說不難吃但也沒有驚艷，可能下次會選擇比較便宜的口味就好。

⭐️其他：
無限時露天戶外酒吧，天氣好的時候看著101慢慢喝酒聊天很放鬆，感覺跨年時就會是擠爆的熱門景點。

但露天室外相對也有缺點，就是如果隔壁桌客人抽菸就會讓人很痛苦，極度討厭菸味的人需要斟酌。

另外就是當天喝酒的過程中有被一隻強哥gank，隔壁桌客人整個被嚇死，戶外喝酒特別是啤酒真的很容易遇到這種狀況也是在所難免，但真的很害怕的人建議也是要斟酌。","2022.09.23 First visit

🍺 beer:
I ordered the two leading craft beer, which were very smooth and delicious, but one of the temperature was not so low when the temperature was not so low. In short Those who are good at drinking beer, please consider.

🍽 Meal:
I ordered the dumplings and cherry duck pizza. I felt that they were not very satisfied. The dumplings seemed to cook the whole skin and the whole skin, and the taste was poor.
The pizza part is very like frozen pizza heating. It is crispy cake skin. It is not unpalatable but not amazing. It may be good to choose cheaper flavors next time.

⭐️ Others:
Infinitely outdoor bars, when the weather is good, it is very relaxed to watch 101 drinking and chatting slowly. It feels like it will be a hot spot in the New Year.

However, there are also shortcomings in the open -air outdoor. If the guests next to the table smoke, it will make people very painful. People who hate the smoke taste need to consider.

The other is that during the drinking process that day, a strong brother GANK was scared to death by the guests next door. Outdoor drinking, especially beer, is really easy to encounter this situation. Also consider.",False

結論是：
（1）如果還是稀罕他們露台的101和南山辦公大樓，可以點杯啤酒坐到爽（對，至少不需要太多技術，也至少說十分鐘給你不會搞成四十分鐘還說你前面還有一杯沒出）
（2）肚子餓就點Finger Food就好，因為只是加熱/炸熟冷凍食品也沒有技術可言

"推薦您台北之旅的最後一晚❗️

我的台北之行通常會在信義區結束。當我走過充滿鄉土情調的小巷，去看高樓大廈的夜景時，我覺得這種體驗的平衡是對的（？）。

今天要跟大家介紹位於新宮的屋頂酒吧，花1萬韓元左右就可以一邊喝啤酒一邊欣賞101塔的景色。這個地方位於微風百貨4樓。您只能搭乘電梯到達，不能搭乘自動扶梯。

店裡有超過16種不同的精釀啤酒。價格區間在200到400新台幣之間，對於101塔景觀的價格來說並不算貴。無論坐在室外的哪個位置，101塔看起來都很大（但是，桌椅不適合長期停留。）

至於啤酒，我想要的是清淡的IPA，所以工作人員推薦了山霧。雖然酒精含量為7.2%，但我很滿意它不像我平常喝的那麼苦，可能是因為淡淡的果味。喝完後，麥芽的香味在口中留下餘韻。

附近還有很多其他酒吧，但我覺得這家最大的好處是下午4點開門，所以你可以早點去。如果您計劃前往台北旅行，請參閱此內容。

🍺山霧特製IPA, 240TWD","Recommend your last night of Taipei ❗️

My trip to Taipei is usually ended in Xinyi District.When I walked through the alley full of local mood and went to see the night view of the high -rise building, I felt that the balance of this experience was right (?).

Today, I want to introduce you to the roof bar in the new palace. You can enjoy the view of 101 towers while drinking beer while spending about 10,000 won.This place is located on the 4th floor of Breeze Department Store.You can only take the elevator to arrive, and you cannot take the escalator.

There are more than 16 different craft beer in the store.The price range is between 200 and NT $ 400, which is not expensive for the price of 101 tower landscapes.No matter which position is sitting outdoors, the 101 tower looks very large (but, tables and chairs are not suitable for long -term stay.)

As for beer, what I want is the light ipa, so the staff recommended the mountain mist.Although the alcohol content is 7.2%, I am very satisfied that it is not as bitter as I usually drink, maybe because of a faint fruity flavor.After drinking, the fragrance of malt leaves the rhyme in the mouth.

There are many other bars nearby, but I think the biggest benefit of this house is to open the door at 4 pm, so you can go early.If you plan to travel to Taipei, see this content.

總的來說，這是一個放鬆、聊天和喝酒的好地方。這裡的人很平靜，音樂也不吵。如果您期待一些瘋狂或震撼的東西，那麼這裡不是地方。它沒有太多的氛圍或裝飾；這只是一個喝精釀啤酒的露天空間。

如果您喜歡啤酒並且不介意花很多錢購買啤酒，那麼您在這裡可能會很開心。正在下雨，但在一個繁忙的晴朗夜晚，屋頂會很有趣。,"If you like beer and don't mind spending a lot of money to buy beer, then you may be very happy here.It was raining, but on a busy sunny night, the roof would be interesting.",False
"啤酒和戶外氣氛都很棒。精彩的。

服務和態度很糟糕。進入後我在酒吧坐下（正常行為）。然後我被告知我需要先在收銀台支付啤酒費用（在點啤酒之前），儘管我面前有兩名空閒的工作人員。

所以，每次你想喝啤酒時，你都需要先排隊付錢。

然後，在外面你必須回去排隊才能再喝一杯啤酒。沒有服務生來接單。不知道他們為什麼要在繁忙的周五晚上這樣做。

我的猜測是，業主對如何提供良好的客戶服務感到困惑。大安掌門酒廠的服務很好。我會放棄這裡的風景，並在那裡得到相同的啤酒和更好的服務。","Beer and outdoor atmosphere are great.Wonderful.

Services and attitudes are bad.After entering, I sat down in the bar (normal behavior).Then I was told me that I needed to pay beer fees (before ordering beer), although I had two idle staff in front of me.

So, every time you want to drink beer, you need to queue up to pay first.

Then, you have to go back to line up to drink another glass of beer.No waiter to pick up orders.I don't know why they do this on the busy Friday night.

My guess is that the owner is confused about how to provide good customer service.The service of the Daan's liquor is very good.I will give up the scenery here and get the same beer and better services there.",False
信義區隱藏的瑰寶，帶來一絲寧靜。工作人員很友好。一品脫啤酒的合理價格。沒有在這裡吃過食物，所以無法對此發表評論。啤酒很棒，味道層次豐富。喜歡戶外座位區，那裡空氣清新，可以看到台北 101 的美麗景色。總的來說，這是一次很好的體驗。唯一的缺點是平日關門比較早。,"The hidden treasures in Xinyi District bring a trace of tranquility.The staff is very friendly.The reasonable price of Yipin Beer.I haven't eaten food here, so I can't comment on this.Beer is great and rich in taste.Like outdoor seats, where the air is fresh, you can see the beautiful scenery of Taipei 101.In general, this is a good experience.The only disadvantage is that it is relatively early on weekdays.",False
"Breeze松高店4樓的精釀啤酒攤位。出入口比較難找，而且Breeze自動扶梯只能到3樓，所以需要搭乘H&M這邊（新光三越和Breeze之間）的電梯才能到4樓。
有室內和室外之分，差別是店內先付錢，店外先付錢。有10種普通啤酒和8種季節性桶裝啤酒。全部可供品嚐。還有可以少量選擇6種來嘗試的套餐。
食物菜單很棒，白菜湯餃子很美味。","Beleze's craft beer stall on the 4th floor of Breeze.The entrance and exit are more difficult to find, and the Breeze escalator can only be on the third floor, so you need to take an elevator on the H & M side (Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and Breeze) to reach the 4th floor.
There are indoor and outdoor distinctions. The difference is to pay first in the store, and pay outside the store first.There are 10 ordinary beer and 8 seasonal barrel beer.All available to taste.There are also a small amount of set meals that you can try.
The food menu is great, and cabbage soup dumplings are delicious.",False
來這裡喝啤酒，留下來享受氣氛。這家酒吧專營獨特的啤酒口味，從IPA到他們自己釀造的水果啤酒。他們確實有食物，但主要是手抓食物和一些餃子和牛肉麵。室外座位很多，可以看到台北101和周邊建築的美景。他們的菜單有英文，他們接受外國和本地信用卡作為付款方式。,"Come here to drink beer and stay to enjoy the atmosphere.This bar specializes in unique beer flavors, from IPA to fruit beer brewed by them.They do have food, but they mainly grab food and some dumplings and beef noodles.There are many outdoor seats, you can see the beauty of Taipei 101 and surrounding buildings.Their menu has English, and they accept foreign and local credit cards as payment methods.",False
這個地方太棒了，景色太美了！文斯（Vince）幫了我們很多忙，他的同事米凱拉（Mikaela）非常好，幫助我們準時拿到了飲料，結果很美味。這個地方太棒了！,"This place is great, the scenery is so beautiful!Vince has helped us a lot. His colleague Mikala is very good to help us get the drink on time, and the result is delicious.This place is great!",False
信義區喝酒的好地方。氣氛很輕鬆，飲料很棒，風景很好。啤酒有很多選擇。食物很一般而且可以改進。除此之外，這是一個喝啤酒和閒逛的好地方。,"A good place to drink in Xinyi District.The atmosphere is easy, the drink is great, and the scenery is very good.There are many options for beer.Food is very average and can be improved.In addition, this is a good place to drink beer and stroll.",False
這是台北市一家很酷的啤酒廠品酒室，位於百貨公司的陽台上。你可以看到美麗的景色（台北101和其他...）並喝當地的精釀啤酒。他們使用機器人調酒師來幫助顧客找到他們應該點什麼樣的啤酒。不過我相信啤酒吧最好的部分是調酒師與你閒聊並給你一些啤酒的建議。,"This is a very cool beer plant wine tasting room in Taipei, which is located on the balcony of the department store.You can see the beautiful scenery (Taipei 101 and others ...) and drink local craft beer.They use robotic bartenders to help customers find what kind of beer they should order.However, I believe that the best part of the beer bar is the bartender chat with you and give you some beer suggestions.",False
就像他們把一家潛水酒吧與一家高端屋頂酒吧混合在一起，但兩者都做得不好。骯髒的家具，高端的價格，基本的服務，普通的啤酒。儘管景色很美，但還是覺得有點悲傷。如果擁有它的人付出一些努力，情況可能會好得多。,"Just like they mixed a diving bar with a high -end roof bar, but both did not do well.Dirty furniture, high -end prices, basic services, ordinary beer.Although the scenery is beautiful, I still feel a little sad.If you have some efforts, the situation may be much better.",False

外面的露台座位非常舒適。很難找到入口。 H&M店內有電梯，我就去了那裡。台北101清晰可見，氣氛很好。,"The terrace seat outside is very comfortable.It's hard to find the entrance.There is an elevator in the H & M shop, so I go there.Taipei 101 is clearly visible, and the atmosphere is very good.",False
這個地方絕對是太棒了！他們有各種各樣的啤酒，屋頂酒吧的景色簡直令人驚嘆。這是與朋友一起度過幾個小時的好地方。此外，即使在週末，這裡也不會太擁擠。如果您在台北 101 附近，絕對推薦您過來,"This place is definitely great!They have a variety of beer, and the scenery of the roof bar is simply amazing.This is a good place to spend a few hours with friends.In addition, even on weekends, it will not be too crowded here.If you are near Taipei 101, you are definitely recommended to come over",False
啤酒很棒，戶外用餐區令人放鬆。但餐點部分：比薩6吋份量不多且用料不紮實，如果可提升餐點的品質搭配啤酒會更棒。,"Beer is great, and the outdoor dining area is relaxed.But the meal section: There are not many 6 -inch portions of Pisa and the ingredients are not solid. It will be better if it can improve the quality of the meal with beer.",False
我公司在這裡舉辦聖誕晚會。不錯的選擇！屋頂酒吧風景優美（可以看到台北101大樓）。啤酒很好。,Our company holds a Christmas party here.Good choice!The landscape of the roof bar is beautiful (you can see the Taipei 101 building).Beer is very good.,False
"它位於大樓的四樓。
在H&M所在大樓找到電梯，上4樓即可找到門市。

精釀啤酒大約有20種。

"您可以在101門前一邊享受啤酒，一邊感受夜風。
但後來開始下雨了，我們決定不坐在露臺上。

我想透過謹慎對待局勢和啤酒選擇來報復。
（我很高興照片拍得很好）","You can enjoy the beer in front of 101, and feel the night breeze.

我同意之前的評論之一。我經歷過的最糟糕的服務經歷之一。酒吧的三名工作人員都非常粗魯和不熱情。我和我的朋友只是想點一杯啤酒，所有三個工作人員看起來都很痛苦。真遺憾，這是一個坐在外面的好地方！永康的位置很好，工作人員很友好！,"I agree with one of the previous comments.One of the worst service experiences I have experienced.The three staff members of the bar are very rude and not enthusiastic.My friend and I just wanted to order a glass of beer, and all three staff members looked painful.Unfortunately, this is a good place to sit outside!Yongkang's location is very good, the staff is very friendly!",False

我最喜歡的台灣啤酒廠。他們的愛達荷7號是一款很不錯的啤酒。啤酒太棒了，我連續四天都回去了。食物充其量只是“oookkk”，只有當你餓了或需要零食時才得到它。星星是給啤酒吃的。,"My favorite Taiwan Brewery.Their Edhata No. 7 is a very good beer.The beer was great, and I went back for four consecutive days.The food is only ""OOOKKK"", and it only gets it when you are hungry or need snacks.Stars are eaten for beer.",False

從 H&M 的屋頂可以欣賞到 101 區域的壯麗景色。自動扶梯無法帶您到達這裡，因此請搭乘電梯前往 4 樓。台灣當地的精釀啤酒價格實惠，黑板上用中英文寫著各種不同的啤酒，就像任何一家時髦的精釀啤酒吧一樣。裡面的座位有限，所以如果下雨的話——祝你好運！外面的面積很大。,"You can enjoy the magnificent scenery of the 101 area from the roof of H & M.The escalator cannot be taken here, so please take the elevator to the 4th floor.Local craft beer in Taiwan is affordable.

I don't know what this brand has happened, but unfortunately it has evolved into disappointment.",False
曾經是個喝好啤酒的好地方，但我認為他們換了新經理什麼的。他們制定了最低購買量規則，所以我不能只是喝杯啤酒和我的伴侶聊天。最重要的是，調酒師非常粗魯，甚至不知道自己的啤酒，聲稱除了一種啤酒之外的所有啤酒都未經過濾（伴侶有過敏）。啊好吧，我帶錢去太湖,"It was a good place to drink a good beer, but I think they have changed the new manager or something.They set the minimum purchase rules, so I can't just drink a cup of beer to chat with my partner.The most important thing is that the bartender is very rude and does not even know his beer. He claims that all beer except a beer has not been filtered (allergic to the partner).Okay, I bring money to Taihu Lake",False
"在四樓，沒有主要的廣告位置標誌，所以我是偶然發現的。

首先喝了一杯小麥啤酒，在炎熱的天氣裡走了一段時間後，清爽又好喝。
有一個英語 IPA 和一個雙 IPA 可供遵循。兩者的味道都非常濃烈，並且符合他們的描述。

點了一些薯條和炸墨西哥辣椒來吃。薯條是帶皮的酒吧風格，墨西哥辣椒出乎意料地辣，這是一個驚喜。

裡面有 4 張桌子，有兩個吧台座位，座位數還可以。

酒吧內的柱子上裝有水龍頭，可以提供水，這一點很不錯（避免了不斷詢問調酒師）

該地區精釀啤酒的定價處於平均水平。

裝潢低劣對於精釀啤酒吧來說是很標準的，但是我想說音樂不符合我的口味（相當現代的英文歌曲，有一些很露骨）

如果您在台北 101 購物或觀光後正在尋找美味的精釀啤酒，我會推薦您。","On the fourth floor, there is no major advertising location logo, so I discovered it by accident.

First drank a glass of wheat beer, and after walking in hot weather for a while, it was refreshing and delicious.
There is an English IPA and a dual IPA for follow.Both of them have a strong taste and are in line with their descriptions.

Ordered some fries and fried Mexican peppers to eat.French fries are a bars style, and Mexican peppers are unexpectedly spicy, which is a surprise.

There are 4 tables in it, two bar seats, and the number of seats is okay.

The pillars in the bar are equipped with faucets and can provide water, which is very good (avoid constantly asking for alcoholics)

The pricing of craft beer in the region is average.

The poor decoration is very standard for the craft beer bars, but I want to say that music does not conform to my taste (quite modern English songs, some are very explicit)

If you are looking for delicious craft beer after shopping or sightseeing in Taipei 101, I will recommend you.",False
位於繁忙的信義區中心的一個隱藏的空中酒吧！不過，美麗的夜景並沒有將人們的注意力從他們的精釀啤酒上移開。如果您喜歡甜味，可以選擇南瓜啤酒或蜂蜜啤酒（都是季節性）。他們的黑啤也是屢獲殊榮的產品，如果您喜歡濃烈、堅硬、質地厚實的黑啤，可以嘗試帝國黑啤或Professor X黑啤。,"A hidden air bar in the center of the busy Xinyi District!However, the beautiful night scene did not remove people's attention from their craft beer.If you like sweetness, you can choose pumpkin beer or honey beer (all seasonal).Their dark beer is also awarded award -winning product.
