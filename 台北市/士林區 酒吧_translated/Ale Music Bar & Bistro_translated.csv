"今晚跟王喜秀老師約定好來做 Roland FP-80數位鋼琴週邊的功能測試，王老師本身就是資深的樂手，所以來到此地什麼歌都可以彈，什麼歌也都可以唱，包括西班牙文，法文，日文，國台語，西洋歌曲通通可以隨心所欲的彈唱，每每看到自己所銷售的樂器在餐酒館在飯店以及許多的公共場所，大型演唱會表演傳播音樂，真的是讓自己有股莫名的成就感。

王老師的餐酒館就在天母地區的忠誠路二段166巷9號1樓,也是鄰近啟明學校附近，晚間這裡就是聚會聊聊天的一個好場所，尤其音樂人開的店最大的福利就是喜歡唱喜歡彈的人很棒有特色的場所，當然願意的話一展琴藝一展歌喉就是來到此地最大的特色。","Tonight, I agreed with Teacher Wang Xixiu to do the functional testing of the ROLAND FP-80 digital piano. Teacher Wang is a senior musician, so you can play any songs here, and you can sing any songs, including Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese Taiwanese, and Western songs can sing as you want. Whenever you see the instruments he sells in the restaurant and tavern in restaurants and many public places, large -scale concert performances spread music. A sense of accomplishment.

Teacher Wang's restaurant is on the first floor No. 96, Lane 166, Section 2, Section 2, Loyalty Road, Tianmu area. It is also near Qiming School. In the evening, this is a good place to chat and chat. Those who like to play are great places. Of course, if you want to show the piano art, the singing voice is the biggest feature of the place here.",False
