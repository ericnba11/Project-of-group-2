"體驗很好，不過大部分的酒感都滿重的。
喝到第三杯已經習慣了。
均價400左右，安安靜靜的很棒。","The experience is very good, but most of the wine feels heavy.
It is used to drinking the third cup.
The average price is about 400, quiet and quiet."
"住家附近的寶藏小店，藏在一個很難找到的小角落裡面的某個小房間，店內只有一個四人座吧檯、一組雙人面牆座位、以及一組約可提供3人座的沙發位，所以建議要來之前先以官方的line@進行訂位，否則很容易沒位置。

這裡只開週五六日，其他日子主要用作調酒課程授課使用，也許也是授課的緣故，bartender對於調酒十分有想法，也很樂於分享及討論，

而酒的風味是最不必多說的，用心、精采、且別緻，值得親自走一趟品味。","The small treasure shop near the home is hidden in a small room in a small corner that is difficult to find. There is only one four -seater bar, a group of double -faced wall seats, and a group of sofa seats that can provide about 3 people. Therefore, it is recommended to use the official LINE@to make a reservation before coming, otherwise it is easy to have no place.

Only Friday and Saturday here, other days are mainly used as lectures for bartending courses. Maybe it is also because of the lectures. Bartender is very thoughtful about bartending and is happy to share and discuss.

And the flavor of wine is the least needed. It is dedicated, brilliant, and chic, and it is worthy of personally."
第一次來，調酒非常專業細緻，店裡氣氛安靜放鬆，我一個人來，覺得非常適合獨飲放鬆或兩人約會。真的非常棒♥️,"For the first time, the bartending was very professional and meticulous. The atmosphere in the store was quiet. I came alone and felt that it was very suitable for drinking alone or dating.It's really great ♥ ️"
店內空間較小，在雨夜前往時正巧店內客人不多，加上店內的風格與氣氛的定位是沈穩的調性，讓人放鬆喝之餘可以好好沉澱一下；主理人對於酒有想法，製作也很細膩不會過度裝飾，每一杯都是用心的作品。建議有意前往的人先在粉專私訊訂位。,"The space in the store is small. When the rainy night is gone, there are not many guests in the store. In addition, the style and the positioning of the atmosphere in the store are calm tone, so that people can make a good precipitation while relaxing. It is also very delicate and not excessively decorated. Each cup is a work with careful work.It is recommended that those who intend to go to the fans first booked a private message."
"氣氛很好，酒不管是經典好還是特調都很棒！
第一次來可能有點難找，卻是值得推薦的好店！（老闆很帥","The atmosphere is very good. Whether it is classic or special, it is great!
It may be a bit difficult to find for the first time, but it is a good shop worth recommending!(The boss is handsome"
"是一間很舒服很自在真心

老闆長得帥
很好的專業調出你喜歡的
空間不大，適合兩三個人想要好好喝杯酒
輕輕鬆鬆無壓力，店內很舒服
（特別提醒第一次去的朋友：要從面對寶雅右手邊的巷子，看到商旅後左邊有個入口，再往下找就會找到）
要記得預約～～老闆會很親切招呼你","It's a very comfortable, very comfortable and sincere
Can drink it well, drink and bartender
The boss looks handsome
Very good professional calling out what you like
The space is not large, suitable for two or three people to want to drink a good glass of wine
It is easy to be stressless, and the store is very comfortable
(In particular, I remind the first friend who went to the first time: From facing the alley on the right hand of Baoya, see a entrance on the left after the business travel, and then find it to find it)
Remember to make an appointment ~~ The boss will greet you very kindly"
"隱身巷弄的舒適小酒吧

"很適合三五好友放鬆閒聊的小酒吧 , 酒單 以外， 也可以order 個人喜歡的調酒。很喜歡播放的音樂讓人很舒服。還有bartender 很帥氣喔！一定會再訪。","It is very suitable for three or five friends to relax and chat. In addition to the wine list, Order can also personalize bartending.The music that likes to play is very comfortable.And Bartender is handsome!Will definitely visit again."
老闆最近有開調酒相關課程，十分推薦給喜歡喝調酒並且想進一步更加了解調酒的人。四堂課下來至少可以學到16種經典調酒，每堂課都會有兩杯實際自己練習的機會，課程內容很精實，從調酒的類型、六大基酒介紹、正確的技法、器具的選擇到了解一杯成功調酒的必須要素，在這四堂課程中都能學到。課程的最後，也會有驗收成果的小活動，需要在十分鐘內自創出一杯調酒，在這之中老闆也會協助給予意見一起溝通討論，看到自己也能成功做出一杯調酒的時候（如圖所示），真的會有滿滿的感動～,"The boss recently has a curriculum -related course, which is very recommended to those who like to drink alcohol and want to learn more about bartending.You can learn at least 16 classic bartending after four lessons. Each class will have two cups of opportunities to practice. The content of the course is very fine. The choice of choice to understand the necessary elements of a successful bartender, which can be learned in these four courses.At the end of the course, there will also be small activities with the results of acceptance. You need to create a cup of bartender in ten minutes. In this way, the boss will also assist in giving opinions to communicate and discuss. When (as shown in the figure), it will really be full of movement ~"
"如果你是一位略懂酒或是想要專注品酒的人
那麼Bar Mosaic將會是你的私房愛店

在台北去過很多家酒吧  喝過各種特調
大多數酒吧更像是為了華麗而生
有時候調酒卻成為附屬的配角
但在這裡可以好好品醇
從入口前鼻尖的香氣
入口後酒體或渾厚或輕盈口感
還有最重要的每一杯酒帶來獨特層次的味道
以及爾後綿長的尾韻

若是喜歡酒感較輕 果香味更豐富的人
那會推薦可以來一杯Sangria
以紅酒為基底的調酒 相對輕盈
或是一杯Gold memory
加入了愛玉的調酒 這個創意真的蠻特別的

若是喜歡酒感較重 希望品味更多層次的人
那麽一杯Penicillin也是推薦名單之一
以兩款威士忌為基底的酒 加入薑汁香氣
另外口袋名單中的Shappro 也是一杯帶來驚喜的酒

如果恰好是復古派調酒的愛好者
那真的會想忍不住把酒單上的都點一遍
不僅有世界經典調酒 還有特定國家的特色調酒 再經過調酒師的個人配方改造
若感興趣的話 瞭解哪款調酒
調酒師甚至可以從起源歷史到風味演變都可以淺述一番

老闆的音樂品味也很好
不用擔心過於吵鬧的配樂影響交談
經典的爵士音樂與這vintage環境完美搭配

略微可惜的地方是
店內空間有限 且營業時間大多只有在五六日
也容易遇上臨時變動
務必要Follow IG 避免白跑一趟
也建議盡量提前預約
另外店內沒有提供食物 要吃飽再喝喔～

地點在寶雅旁的巷子裏218室
第一次前往會有點難找
酒香不怕巷子深也許就適合用在這裡吧","If you are a person who understands wine or wants to focus on wine tasting
Then Bar Mosaic will be your private shop

I have been to many bars in Taipei to drink various special adjustments
Most bars are more like a gorgeous
Sometimes bartending becomes a supporting role
But here you can taste good mellow
The aroma of the tip of the nose in front of the entrance
After the entrance, the wine body or thick or light taste
There is also the most important glass of wine that brings a unique layer of taste
And the long tail rhyme

If you like a person with a lighter wine, a person with a lighter fruity aroma
It will be recommended to have a cup of SANGRIA
The bartending based on red wine is relatively light.
Or a cup of Gold Memory
Joining Aiyu's bartending creativity is really special

If you like more wine, you want more people who taste more levels
Then a cup of Penicillin is also one of the recommended lists
Add the aroma of ginger juice based on two whiskey -based wines
In addition, the shappro in the pocket list is also a glass of surprise wine

If it happens to be a vintage bartending enthusiast
I really want to take the one on the wine list again
Not only the world's classic bartending, but also the characteristic bartender of a specific country and then through the personal formula of the bartender.
If you are interested, you can understand which alcohol
The bartender can even be stretched from the history of origin to the evolution of flavors

The boss's music taste is also very good
Do not worry about being too noisy soundtracks to affect conversation
Classic jazz music is perfectly matched with this vintage environment

Slightly a pity is
The space in the store is limited and the business hours are mostly only five or six days
It is also easy to encounter temporary changes
Do you need Follow IG to avoid running in vain
It is also recommended to make an appointment in advance as much as possible
In addition, if you do n’t provide food in the store, you should eat full before drinking ~

Room 218 in the alley next to Baoya
It will be a bit difficult to find for the first time
Jiu Xiang is not afraid of the alley deep, maybe it is suitable for use here"
"愛店
目前喝過的每一杯都喜歡","Love shop
I like every cup of currently drinking"
"調酒好喝！老闆很帥
環境很好👍🏻👌🏻
位置比較少建議先訂位","Blooming is delicious!The boss is very handsome
The environment is very good 👍🏻👌🏻
It is relatively small to book a position first"
當代經典雞尾酒的質感小店，非常喜歡,"The texture of contemporary classic cocktails, I like it very much"
"絕對是台北最愛的酒吧！
舒舒服服的環境，高品質的調酒，還有貼心的老闆，一切都好優秀！","Definitely the favorite bar in Taipei!
A comfortable environment, high -quality bartending, and intimate boss, everything is excellent!"
"只有週末營業的小酒吧，可以留意他們的ig會有公告。
距離捷運站不遠，位於很特別的小巷子。

酒吧位子不多，建議訂位；整體環境非常喜歡，有點像秘密酒吧。
酒單沒有中文，但老闆（調酒師）會很細心地詢問並建議客人。
調酒的品質非常高，配上這個價格真的物超所值。

老闆人真的很好而且很專業！會常去！","Only the bars that are open on weekends can pay attention to their IG will be announced.
Not far from the MRT station, located in a very special alley.

There are not many seats in the bar, it is recommended to order; the overall environment likes it very much, a bit like a secret bar.
There is no Chinese in the wine list, but the boss (bartender) will be carefully asked and suggests guests.
The quality of bartending is very high, and it is really worthy of this price.

The boss is really good and professional!Will go often!"
味道鮮明強烈，每杯酒都有想法而且主題好懂，老闆做每杯酒都十分用心，非常值得一訪再訪,"The taste is sharp and strong, each glass of wine has ideas and the theme is easy to understand. The boss is very careful to make each glass of wine. It is worth visiting again."
"台北市最優雅的Speakeasy Bar之一，雖然空間不大，但是從內部擺設、酒單設計跟酒的呈現都可以感受到老闆Claid 的用心跟堅持。

除了酒之外，也推薦參加老闆開的調酒課與其他愛酒的朋友交流學習！","One of the most elegant Speakeasy Bar in Taipei. Although there is not much space, you can feel the boss Claid's intention and persistence from the internal decoration, the presentation of the wine list design and the presentation of wine.

In addition to wine, I also recommend participating in the bartending lessons from the boss to communicate with other friends who love wine!"
"調酒好喝，不只名字有意境，味道也很豐富，非常喜歡帶朋友一起前來小聚。

店內麻雀雖小五臟俱全，音樂很好聽、老闆親切有禮，記得客人在店裡發生的有趣小事或喝過的調酒，讓人備感溫馨，也感覺得出是間很重視細節的店。

每次必點的是特調 Gold memory #2，蜜李+香草+包種茶+愛玉的搭配從沒在其他地方喝到過，非常特別，作為收尾令人回味無窮。

最近覺得Sangria也很清爽好喝，紅酒為基底搭配莓果與鳳梨，酸中帶甜好特別，似乎更適合作為第二杯。

期待下次的驚喜。

(附圖非上面提到的兩款）","The bartending is delicious, not only the name is artistic, but also the taste is very rich. I like to bring friends with friends.

Although the sparrows in the store are all in the small organs, the music is very nice, the boss is kind and courteous. Remember that the interesting trivial matter that the guests happened in the store or drank, which made people feel warm, and also felt that it was a shop that attaches great importance to details.

Every time I must order is the special GOLD MEMOMORY #2, Honey Li+Vanilla+Bags, Seed Tea+Aiyu, has never been drinking elsewhere. It is very special and is endless as the end.

Recently, I feel that SANGRIA is also very refreshing and delicious. Red wine is based on berry and pineapple. It is sweet and special in acid, which seems to be more suitable as the second cup.

Looking forward to the next surprise.

介紹的酒都很好喝，bartender 帥！,"The wine introduced is delicious, Bartender is handsome!"
調酒、裝潢、音樂、理念，襯托酒吧經營者的靈魂，調酒所求也投其所好，探尋內心喜好的味道，調酒本身的平衡，讓人也多份心思熟慮，如尋放鬆、清幽、靜謐、平靜、沈澱，必參訪此地👍。 …,"Wine alcohol, decoration, music, concept, set off the soul of the bar operator, the sake of bartending also voted for it, explore the taste of inner preference, the balance of bartender itself makes people think more, such as finding and loosening , Clean, quiet, calm, and precipitated, you must visit the place.Mowing"
經典沒話說，沒在酒單上的經典調酒一樣可以詢問bartender喔！,"Classic has nothing to say, you can ask Bartender without classic bartending on the wine list!"
"來這邊喝過酒，非常喜歡這裡的氣氛
所以來上調酒課

不過第一次要來有點難找

把門打開就找到了唷！","I have come here to drink alcohol, I like the atmosphere here very much
So come to bartender class

Enter the aisle in the right hand of the hotel
Go to the bottom right and turn right, pass the stairs
Go forward a little bit
You will see that there is a shop name on the glass door
Open the door and find it!"
氣氛好，是舒服且寧靜的空間。而且老闆很帥，也很有品味，店內座位不多，要記得提前預約。,"The atmosphere is good, it is a comfortable and peaceful space.And the boss is very handsome and tasteful. There are not many seats in the store. Remember to make an appointment in advance."

"從外面看起來不像酒吧，喜歡他們提供的非常小的空間，所以感覺溫馨舒適，還有一點，非常安靜！ 💯 台北的酒吧大多裝潢精美、設計精美，但光顧酒吧的人卻太吵鬧，不知道如何享受和欣賞這個地方。

我點的飲料都很不錯，選擇不是很多，但很特別。調酒師也很友善。

總的來說，我喜歡它！ ✨","It does not look like a bar, I like very small space they provide, so I feel warm and comfortable, and there is one more, very quiet!Most of the bars in Taipei are exquisitely decorated and exquisitely designed, but the people who patronize the bar are too noisy. I don't know how to enjoy and appreciate this place.

The drinks I ordered are very good. There are not many choices, but very special.The bartender is also very friendly.

Overall, I like it!Bleak"
可愛的小隱藏酒吧！座位不多，但服務很好。飲料非常美味而且也很獨特。,"Cute little hidden bar!There are not many seats, but the service is good.The drink is very delicious and unique."
小型舒適的酒吧，最多可容納 10 個座位。調酒師很友善，飲料也恰到好處。有點難找，但它位於一樓，位於其中一個「工作室」內。不是在飯店裡面！,"Small and comfortable bars can accommodate up to 10 seats.The bartender is very friendly and the drink is just right.It is a bit difficult, but it is located on the first floor and in one of the ""studios"".Not in the restaurant!"
