"店內裝潢氣氛很好,可惜老闆態度非常不好,坐下前有先詢問是否能抽菸,店員回答可以,
但我們抽雪茄的時候卻被拒絕,因為會影響其他客人,雪茄味比煙味重？
當我們準備要離開時被要求要先付最低消費,點的酒沒開過也不能退,詢問咖啡是否能外帶,也被告知我們這裡不是咖啡廳,你要就喝完再走,老闆竟然也大剌剌在我們面前跟其他客人抱怨,你是當我們聽不懂中文嗎？你的貓比你還會招待客人！你要向他學習！","The interior decoration atmosphere is very good, but unfortunately the boss's attitude is very bad. Before sitting down, ask if you can smoke.

"老闆態度差，詢問低酒精的酒口氣就很不好，不會給建議，沒有bartender 的專業度可言。水杯沒水想加個水，老闆態度很不敬業，跟他表示要加水，聽到也不表示一下有沒有聽到，要講很多次⋯也不會主動加水，這樣跟我收10趴服務費！！？？
經典魔西多個人覺得不好喝，老闆會在室內抽煙，室內就是可以吸菸的。","The boss has a poor attitude. Ask the wine of low alcohol, it is very bad. He will not give suggestions. There is no professionalism of Bartnder.I want to add a water without water, the boss's attitude is very disrespectful. He told him to add water. I did n’t say that I heard it.

價錢比附近的貴，沒有服務沒有給水另外要收服務費，屋內烏煙瘴氣有人狂抽煙亂罵髒話，酒錢亂算，而且可能是不衛生，朋友喝完肚子痛，除非沒地方去不然這裡只有一隻貓值得而已，為了上廁所進來的真是後悔。,"The price is more expensive than the nearby. There is no service and no service fee. Some people in the house have smoke and smoke and scold the swear words. The wine is not hygienic. The cat is worth it, and it is really regretful to come in for the toilet.",False
煙味重，調酒失敗，價錢沒有少收。大概是附近酒吧滿了之後，找不到其他店但又想喝一杯的備案。不過誠心建議努力再找一找心情才不會被破壞,"The smell of smoke is heavy, the bartender fails, and the price does not receive less.Probably after the nearby bar is full, I can't find other stores but want to drink a cup of record.But sincerely suggest that you will work hard to find another mood to be destroyed",False

"裝潢非常講究，其中的淡水魚缸據說價值超過 10 萬元🙃。

老闆娘十分直爽，喝多後直接抱怨客戶的聊天內容「傷風敗俗」，彷彿誤以為我們還處於戒嚴時期。結帳完畢後，甚至開始對客戶抱怨和挑釁，讓人有些無言。

附上當天的消費紀錄。","The decoration is very particular, and the freshwater fish tank is said to be worth more than 100,000 yuan.

The boss is very straightforward. After drinking too much, he directly complained that the customer's chat content was ""injured and irritable"", as if mistakenly thought that we were still in the martial arts period.After the checkout, I even started complaining and provocation to customers, making people a little speechless.

Attach the consumption record on the day.",False
這家酒吧以優美的爵士樂為背景氛圍。老闆喬伊斯（Joyce）非常友好，會讓您坐在酒吧時推薦新的爵士樂曲。有一隻非常友善但冷漠的貓，它實際上可能是老闆。  當我回到台北時，這家精緻的酒店絕對是我的首選。,"This bar takes a beautiful jazz as the background atmosphere.The boss Joyce is very friendly and will let you recommend new jazz music when you sit in the bar.There is a very friendly but indifferent cat, which may actually be the boss.When I returned to Taipei, this exquisite hotel was definitely my first choice.",False
"我在3-4星之間猶豫。這是一個很好的發現。輕鬆的音樂。很好的員工。吧台上甚至還有一隻貓在走來走去，您可以撫摸它！飲料還可以，價格也可以接受。他們的菜單上也有食物。
不幸的是，人們可以在酒吧吸煙，這讓幾顆星掉下來了，呼吸有點困難。","I hesitated between 3-4 stars.This is a good discovery.Easy music.Very good employees.There is a cat walking around on the bar, you can touch it!Drinks are ok, and the price is acceptable.There are also foods on their menus.

During our visit, they spent joy at 20:00 to 22:00.In addition, Carlsberg buys 2 get 1 free at any time.",False
粗魯的調酒師，骯髒，價格過高，而且骯髒。該地區更好的酒吧。我想當它在 90 年代開業時，你可能會對顧客很粗魯，因為城裡可供選擇的酒吧越來越少，而且人們無法在網上寫下他們的經歷。,"The rude bartender, dirty, too high, and dirty.A better bar in the area.I think when it opens in the 1990s, you may be rude to customers, because there are fewer and fewer chosen bars in the city, and people cannot write their experience online.",False
步行即可到達新一安和地鐵站。我們本來打算去其他地方，但它已經訂滿了，所以我們碰巧來到了這個地方。雖然我們去的時候沒有人抽煙，但還是能聞到煙味。我朋友點的是長島（NTD350），我的是龍舌蘭日出（NTD260），味道不太好。總的來說，這對我來說不是一個舒適的地方。,"You can reach Xinyi'an and Metro Station.We originally planned to go to other places, but it was already full, so we happened to come to this place.Although no one smokes when we go, we can still smell the smell of smoke.My friend ordered Long Island (NTD350), and mine is lined with Dalm (NTD260), which tastes not good.In general, this is not a comfortable place for me.",False
"可愛的調酒師喬伊斯非常友好和熱情，我們整晚都待在那裡，度過了一個美妙的夜晚

極其舒適的空間，伴隨著柔和的爵士樂。這是一個即使一個人來也不會感到負擔的舒適的地方。","The paradise of the smoker after 9 pm.
Extremely comfortable space, accompanied by soft jazz.This is a comfortable place that does not feel burden even if a person comes.",False
問我能不能抽煙。他們說是的，我帶著兩支雪茄來抽，還付了兩杯飲料的錢。當我點燃雪茄時，我被告知雪茄是不允許的，並被迫支付飲料費用，儘管他們還沒有準備好，我也不想再留下來了。 +咖啡上的貓毛哈哈。,"Ask me if I can smoke.They said yes, I took two cigars to draw, and paid two cups of drinks.When I lit the cigar, I was told that the cigar was not allowed and forced to pay the drink cost. Although they were not ready, I didn't want to stay again.+Cat hair on coffee haha.",False
毫無疑問，當我想要一個與朋友放鬆和聊天的地方時，它是我首先想到的酒吧。調酒師散發著堅定不移的專業精神，提供無與倫比的體驗。特別是，她提供鎮上最好的 Ardbeg，使其在口味和品質上無與倫比。她巧妙地在店內營造出一種高度的氛圍，散發出一種真正溫暖的氛圍，使其成為我真正珍惜的庇護所——無與倫比的幸福和滿足的源泉。,"There is no doubt that when I want to relax and chat with my friends, it is the first bar I think of.The bartender exudes an unswerving professional spirit and provides an unparalleled experience.In particular, she provides the best ARDBEG in the town to make it unparalleled in taste and quality.She cleverly created a high level of atmosphere in the store, exuding a truly warm atmosphere, making it a source of unparalleled happiness and satisfaction.",False
元朋克。我非常喜歡這個酒吧。  對於每個物種來說，這都是一個安全的空間。就像基思理查德（Keith Richard）曾經在穿過傑斐遜酒店的走廊時向客房門口扔瓶波本威士忌和香煙時喊道：“喝一杯！抽根菸吧！放鬆。,"Yuan punk.I like this bar very much.For each species, this is a safe space.Just like Keith Richard, he shouted at the door of the guest room while passing through the corridor of the Jefferson Hotel, ""Drink a cup! Stretching the cigarette! Relax.",False
"這家酒吧很好地說明了這座城市酒吧的現狀。台灣啤酒250元一瓶！一杯啤酒 7 歐元！如果這對您來說還不夠，您的最低消費為
每人300美元，當然還有（還不夠離譜）10%的服務費。他們甚至還有一個“特殊餐桌”，最低消費3000元。工作人員也有點不友好，他們為您提供瓶裝德國小麥熊，這也表明價格根本不合理。
因此，如果您不想被利用，最好避開這個地方！","This bar shows the status quo of the city bar well.Taiwan Beer 250 yuan a bottle!A cup of beer 7 euros!If this is not enough for you, your minimum consumption is

"小夥伴們在這家店點餐的時候要小心哦！首先飲料的基本價格非常高！好例子：台灣啤酒250台幣...這真是犯罪！此外，每人的最低消費為300+，他們也要求收取10%的服務費。他們沒有提前告訴我們那些「隱藏」費用！結果我們四個人就得付1800新台幣（50歐元或60美元！！！）！啤酒！
我只能建議大家小心並避開這個酒吧！","Be careful when ordering at this shop!First of all, the basic price of drinks is very high!Good example: Taiwan Beer 250 Taiwan dollars ... This is really a crime!In addition, the minimum consumption of each person is 300+, and they also require a 10%service fee.They did not tell us those ""hidden"" costs in advance!As a result, the four of us had to pay NT $ 1,800 (50 euros or $ 60 !!!)!beer!
I can only suggest that everyone be careful and avoid this bar!",False
不錯的地方，但每人最低收費300元台幣，另加10%的服務費。台北有很多很棒的酒吧，可以用更優惠的價格買到啤酒,"A good place, but the minimum fee of 300 yuan per person, plus 10%of the service fee.There are many great bars in Taipei, you can buy beer at a more favorable price",False
很棒的酒吧，好喝的威士忌，可愛的員工，還有最好的該死的貓🐱♥️貓是生意的門面，也是酒吧的老闆，強烈推薦☺️ …,"A great bar, delicious whiskey, cute employees, and the best damn cat 🐱♥ ️ Cat is the facade of the business and the boss of the bar. It is highly recommended ☺️ ...",False

喜歡它的一切。我來到台北三天，其中兩個晚上都在這裡度過。超級寒冷的氛圍和友好的主人。很想有一天回來,"Like everything.I came to Taipei for three days, two of them spent two nights.Super cold atmosphere and friendly owner.I really want to come back one day",False
友善、古老的歐元、古色古香的規模吸引力，以及多代人的爵士樂演奏。桶裝吉尼斯黑啤酒和多種雞尾酒可供選擇。身為一個常來台北的外國人，我總是順便來適應。,"Friendly, ancient euro, antique attraction, and jazz performances of many generations.Barrel Guinness Black Beer and a variety of cocktails are available.As a foreigner who often come to Taipei, I always come to adapt.",False
好音樂——主要是爵士樂——而且音量恰到好處，既可以欣賞，又可以交談。,"Good music -mainly jazz -and the volume is just right, you can appreciate and talk.",False
我來這裡已經很多年了！這是一個享用優質飲品和氛圍的好地方。對每個人來說都是一個美好的地方！,I have been here for many years!This is a good place to enjoy high -quality drinks and atmosphere.It is a wonderful place for everyone!,False
舒適、優質的雞尾酒，還有一隻非常非常可愛的貓作為你的伴侶。,"A comfortable, high -quality cocktail, and a very, very cute cat as your partner.",False
和一群人一起去這裡，是這個地方唯一的人。相對於品質來說有點貴，而且他們要求每人最低300。再次，就品質而言，感覺有點不對勁。,"Going here with a group of people is the only person in this place.It is a bit expensive than quality, and they require a minimum of 300 per person.Again, as far as quality is concerned, it feels a bit wrong.",False
"飲料 - 價格過高。

服務生——不太友善；充其量是務實的。","Drink -too high.

一顆星，如果可能的話甚至更少。價格過高，雞尾酒被洗了，老太太顯然喝了她的大腦，太粗魯了！,"A star, even less if possible.The price was too high, the cocktail was washed, and the old lady obviously drank her brain, so rude!",False
