當「自製雞肝醬佐焦化洋蔥」端上桌的那一瞬間，第一眼看見那份雞肝醬，心中不禁浮現了貓罐頭的畫面，讓我會心一笑🤣。
濃郁的雞肝醬帶著微苦和雞油的香氣，口感如絲般順滑，慢慢在舌尖融化。焦化洋蔥的甜美與肝醬的醇厚交織，完美地為接下來的餐點鋪平了道路。

接著，「磨霍章魚佐香煎洋芋及鷹嘴豆泥」無疑是一道令人驚嘆的地中海風味佳作。
章魚肉Q彈有嚼勁，酸甜鹹的鷹嘴豆泥為這道菜注入了活力。當兩者一同入口，海洋的鮮味與鷹嘴豆的香氣在口中交織，整體口感豐富且和諧。

經典的「西班牙橄欖油蒜蝦」，這道菜早已是眾人皆知的西班牙美食代表。
每隻蝦都緊實飽滿，Q彈的肉質與橄欖油和蒜香相得益彰，讓鮮味在口中綻放。料理加入了少許辣椒，微微的辛辣讓這道經典菜式更添層次，讓人忍不住一隻接著一隻品嚐，搭配一旁的麵包，淋上充滿蝦味的橄欖油，咬一口麵包配一口蝦，超級絕配。

「地中海風香煎小卷佐生菜沙拉」是一道看似簡單卻充滿驚喜的料理。
香煎過的小卷外皮微焦，內裡卻嫩滑多汁，散發出大海的鮮味與淡淡的墨汁香氣。清爽的生菜沙拉與小卷形成完美的平衡。雖然網上評論常說這道菜的份量偏少，但對於兩個人來說，這樣的分量正合適，飽足感十足。

當晚最讓人魂牽夢縈的「小牛肋排佐焦化洋蔥及時蔬」。
這道主菜展現了極高的技藝，外層的黑胡椒與鹽巴醃製為肋排賦予了鹹香帶出食材原有的甜味，完美烹煮後外皮微脆，內裡軟嫩多汁。咬一口送入口中，肉汁瞬間充滿口腔，濃郁的肉味與焦化洋蔥的甜香相輔相成，這道菜無疑讓人感到極大的滿足，是晚餐的絕對亮點。

甜點部分則為這場饗宴畫上了完美的句點。

「香芋起司蛋糕」的口感細膩，
芋頭的香甜與起司的濃郁相互交織，既不過於甜膩，也不會讓人覺得單調。
最有趣的是，這是我第一次看到男友吃芋頭料理
（主廚的超神奇力量？）

「多利哈茲」為整場晚餐劃下句點。
這道傳統西班牙家庭甜點在復活節期間特別受歡迎，外皮裹上蛋液油炸至酥脆，撒上糖粉增添脆感，內裡卻保持柔軟濕潤。搭配冰淇淋，冰火交融的口感瞬間征服了味蕾。

此次用餐也有不滿的地方，店家忘了我們的甜點等了20分鐘，我們*主動*詢問才送芋頭蛋糕。

送了芋頭蛋糕，多利哈茲又多等了10分鐘，店家還重複送了芋頭蛋糕，我們有退回。

還有一點更不滿的是，有一位服務員餐具幾乎快用丟的，我嘗試好幾次放餐具，怎麼放也沒有那位服務員大聲，影響到用餐心情。","-On homemade chicken liver sauce, coking onion

The moment when the ""homemade chicken liver sauce coking onion"" was served on the table, at first glance, I saw the chicken liver sauce, and I couldn't help showing the canned cat's picture, which made me smile.
The rich chicken liver sauce with slightly bitterness and the aroma of chicken oil, the taste is as smooth, slowly melting at the tip of the tongue.The sweetness of the coking onion and the mellow intertwined of the liver sauce perfectly paved the road for the next meals.

Then, ""Mo Huo Octopus Pancar Pacific and Eagle Mouth Bean Pud"" is undoubtedly an amazing masterpiece of Mediterranean.
The octopus meat Q bombs are chewy, and the sweet and sour eagle mouth bean injects vitality into this dish.When the two are entrance, the umami flavor of the ocean is intertwined with the aroma of the eagle beans, and the overall taste is rich and harmonious.

The classic ""Spanish olive oil and shrimp"", this dish has long been known as Spanish food representatives.
Each shrimp is tight and full, and the meat quality of the Q bullet complements the olive oil and garlic, so that the flavor blooms in the mouth.Add a little chili with the cooking, and the slight spicy spicy makes this classic dish even more layered, making people unable to help one after another, with the bread on the side, drizzled with shrimp flavor, bite a noodle with a bite with a bite Shrimp, super perfect match.

""Mediterranean -style fried roll of small rolls of salad"" is a seemingly simple but surprise dish.
The fried small rolls of small rolls are slightly scorched, but the inside is tender and juicy, exuding the umami taste and a faint ink aroma of the sea.The refreshing lettuce salad forms a perfect balance with the small roll.Although online comments often say that the amount of this dish is relatively small, for two people, this weight is just right and full.

That night, the most dreamy ""cattle ribs, coking onions in time.""
This main dish shows a very high skill. The black pepper and salt on the outer layer are marinated with the ribs to give the original sweetness of salty incense. After the perfect cooking, the outer skin is slightly crispy and the inside is soft and juicy.When you bite into your mouth, the gravy is full of oral cavity. The rich meat taste is complementary to the sweet fragrance of the coking onion. This dish undoubtedly makes people feel greatly satisfied. It is an absolute highlight of dinner.

The dessert part draws a perfect end to this feast.

The taste of ""taro cheese cake"" is delicate,
The sweetness of the taro is intertwined with the rich cheese, which is not only sweet and not to make people feel monotonous.
The most interesting thing is that this is the first time I have seen my boyfriend eating taro dishes
(Chef's superpower?)

""Dolhaz"" was ended for the whole dinner.
This traditional Spanish family dessert is particularly popular during Easter. The outer skin is wrapped in egg liquid and fried until it is crispy, sprinkled with sugar powder to add crispy, but it remains soft and humid inside.With ice cream, the taste of ice and fire conquer the taste buds instantly.

There are also dissatisfaction among the meals. The store forgot our dessert for 20 minutes. We took the initiative to ask for the taro cake.

After sending the taro cake, Dolhaz waited for another 10 minutes. The shop also repeatedly sent the taro cake. We returned.

One more dissatisfied is that a waiter's tableware was almost lost. I tried several times to put the tableware. There was no waiter loudly, which affected the mood of dining.",False,0.118,0.034,0.848,0.9957

"先講評語還有吃過的西班牙餐廳
(ALMA/五星，樂盒子/五星，西班牙本地餐廳)
完全沒有呈現出西班牙料理該有的特色

1.蒜油蝦:2/5分
橄欖油AND蒜AND蝦味道完全沒有融合，就只算免強及格而已，麵包十分的一般

2.西班牙蛋餅:1/5分
0喜悅度，就是一般自己在家做的烘蛋味道然後+一點馬鈴薯去做稍微點綴

3.西班牙人玉米掛包:3/5分
玉米餅算是比較新奇的味道，相比之下還算還可以的一到料理

4.海鮮燉飯: -1/5分
完完全全得敗筆，你可以不吃，但一定要請你朋友吃

5.香煎小卷:-1/5分
鹹味過重且食材醬料搭配得並不恰當

6.西班牙肉丸松露味:3/5分
有相對異國料理的味道，整體肉丸也不會過鹹，恰當好處，與玉米餅一樣算是可以的料理

7.托里哈斯:4/5分
意外的是，這家甜點十分得不錯，建議來吃甜點即可

肉桂加上霜糖的組合，讓這道甜品的顯得尤其突出，且與炸麵包香草冰淇淋搭配後相輔相成，入口首先是肉桂糖的甜味，再來則是冰淇淋的香草味，最後則是麵包的麵粉香

8.宿醉蛋糕:5/5分
會給這道甜點滿分的評價
巧克力不會過甜，蛋糕的質地有咬勁又不會過於堅硬且濕潤感適中，像極了在歐洲吃到的薩赫蛋糕

結論:
吃甜點會來，吃料理的話還是算了","Let's talk about the comments first and the Spanish restaurant you have eaten
(Alma/five -star, music box/five -star, Spanish local restaurant)
There is no characteristic of Spanish cuisine at all

1. Garlic oil shrimp: 2/5 points
Olive oil and garlic and shrimp flavor are not fusion at all, just as exempt from passing. The bread is very average.

2. Spanish egg cake: 1/5 points
0 Joy is the taste of roasting eggs at home, then+a little potato to make a little embellishment

3. Spanish corn hanging bag: 3/5 points
The corn cake is a relatively novel taste. In contrast, it is still possible to get a dish.

4. Seafood stewed rice: -1/5 points
It's completely defeated, you can not eat it, but you must ask your friends to eat

5. Small roll: -1/5 points
The salty taste is too heavy and the ingredients sauce is not properly matched properly

6. Spanish meatball truffle flavor: 3/5 points
There is a taste of relatively exotic cuisine, and the overall meatballs will not be too salty, which is appropriate. It is like corn cake.

7. Torihas: 4/5 points
Surprisingly, this dessert is very good, it is recommended to eat desserts

The combination of cinnamon and cream sugar makes this dessert look particularly prominent, and complement each other after combining with fried bread vanilla ice cream. The entrance is the sweetness of cinnamon sugar, and then the vanilla flavor of ice cream. Finally, the flour of bread flour is finally fragrant

8. Drunk cake: 5/5 points

底下鋪的是馬鈴薯泥，也很搭～

海鮮燉飯個人覺得還好，跟預料中的有點不一樣，比較像炒飯（？ 有點鍋巴感的米飯一粒粒的，是好吃的，只是就感覺不是燉飯～

據說還有地下室空間，但沒實際走下去看不知道是不是跟一樓一樣大。
因為食物口味比較重，對我而言Sangria兩人一壺可能不太夠。
食物調味不錯，兩個人吃了三個tapas + 一個海鮮燉飯，吃完不會餓，但還可以再吃或喝一點東西。食量大的建議再多點一、兩道tapas、或生菜沙拉。

這次Meat ball 選了hot and spicy 。對不太吃辣的我來說，並不算辣，反倒是微辣感在舌頭上。像是莎莎醬加上Tabasco 搭配上meatball，適合喝酒聊天吃的小點。單吃醬辣感會比較豐富，也可以把剩下的醬放上炸雞上，會多一種風味感。不知道店家有沒有單賣醬，很適合搭配玉米片在家週末看電影邊吃。

炸雞部分選用棒棒腿裹粉炸，剛炸好的肉汁很多，搭配上店家自製辣味西南醬會一口接著一口。
缺點就是沒有主動供水，會需要喝酒或是自帶水。

海鮮燉飯是很標準的燉飯，吃完對我而言不太有記憶點。但在西班牙吃的口味相似，會留一點米心。","The store is not large and the seats are relatively small.
It is said that there is still a basement space, but I do n’t know if I do n’t know if it is as big as the first floor.

The food was pretty good. Two people ate three TAPAS + a seafood stew. They would not be hungry after eating, but they could also eat or drink something.Suggestions with large amounts of food are more, two tapas, or lettuce salads.

This time Meat Ball chose Hot and Spicy.For me who is not too spicy, it is not spicy, but it is slightly spicy on my tongue.Like Sasha sauce and tabasco with Meatball, it is suitable for drinking and chatting.Eating sauce alone will be rich in spicy, and you can also put the remaining sauce on fried chicken, which will have a flavor.I do n’t know if the store has a single sauce, which is very suitable for merit with corn slices to watch movies on weekends.

The fried chicken parts are fried with a stick leg. There are many gravy that have just fried. With the shop's homemade spicy southwest sauce, it will take a bite.

✨脆皮薯塊

✨蜜汁脆茄佐鷹嘴豆泥
不敢吃茄子的我覺得超香，外皮酥脆有一點蜂蜜的味道，記得沾底下都鷹嘴豆泥一起入口。

✨香煎小捲
很新鮮，醬汁很特別，感覺是很道地的西班牙味！

✨海鮮燉飯
用料很實在，也是我們等最久的一道！
粒粒分明不會太過濕軟，也都非常入味，海鮮有四種，都很新鮮～

✨招牌特製燉牛頰
肉很嫩，不過底下的馬鈴薯泥有點太多😂
不會特別推薦這個

✨芋頭起司蛋糕
起司超濃郁！搭配淡淡的芋頭香，完全不會死甜超耍嘴，而且蠻大一塊的，覺得很有誠意～

✨多利哈茲

餐點：
烘蛋薯餅：口感厚實，大蒜醬非常香
辣味肉丸：肉丸偏紮實肉塊感，醬料辣椒香氣很明顯但不會過辣，反而混合香料很刺激唾液，約嚼越香。
海鮮燉飯：超出印象的一道，跟以往吃到的完全不一樣，鮮嫩的海鮮配上偏硬但是吸滿海鮮湯汁的飯，一點點鍋巴感，讓人欲罷不能。（大推薦）
燉牛頰：跟法式或是一般西式的呈現方式不太一樣，肉感比較偏手撕感而不軟嫩，整體的肉味偏重甚至有點野，混合醬汁的香料跟底部的薯泥，整體有種隱含的狂野。
豬肉口袋餅刈包：這道是後來加點的，因為已經有點醉，所以完全不記得名稱只能大概取個類似的，店家的手製玉米餅，夾著手撕豬肉、香料、起司，不複雜但是因為現做的玉米餅而大加分，溫熱的餅，外香脆內鬆軟，入口會散發玉米的甜，配上內容物，簡單卻美味，令人回味。（大推薦）

酒：很大杯，但是沒點到特色酒款有點可惜

內裝：乾淨偏小，座位是舒服的，人多會有些擁擠

服務：兩位服務生在客滿的時候真的不太夠，女服務生非常專業，男的就不知道在幹嘛，完全不會推薦，雖然服務認真但是希望多加強專業度。

"西班牙餐酒館，有戶外座位，室內空間不大，坐起來偏緊迫，加上是開放式廚房，所以吃完油煙味頗重，出餐速度略慢，整體口味上偏鹹香，強烈建議搭配酒類一起享用。

🔸juju招牌炸雞
香料炸雞，外脆內軟，醃料味鹹，鮮味淡。

🔸西班牙壞蛋薯片
菜單說是香脆薯片，但其實吃起來是濕軟的馬鈴薯厚片，味道來源主要是鹹香的臘腸肉末。

🔸招牌蒜味辣椒蝦
必點！簡單的橄欖油+大蒜+辣椒，吃起來油甘蒜辣，非常迷人，這作法搭配義大利麵應該超棒；蝦子的部分雖然口感不錯，但可能是舌頭被油甘包覆又被蒜辣刺激，所以吃不太出來蝦子的鮮甜。

🔸海鮮燉飯
海鮮非常鮮美，不過飯吃起來不知道為什麼口感略粉，而且調味有點過於鹹香，鮮味相比之下就顯得偏淡薄。

🔸多利哈滋
油炸麵包口感類似布丁麵包，內部偏濕，吃起來軟綿，外層有灑個人不愛的肉桂粉，不過整體肉桂味不重，搭配香草冰淇淋還不錯就是了。

🔸主廚秘方芋頭起司蛋糕
口感香軟綿滑中帶點Q，有細細的芋頭纖維粗感，一開始感覺只是塊口感略粗的起司蛋糕，但等到蛋糕在嘴裡化開後卻有芋頭滋味慢慢浮現，起司跟芋頭搭配轉化的相當完美，無論你是起司控還是芋頭控都一定要吃吃看，非常棒的甜點，大推！","The Spanish dining tavern has outdoor seats, the indoor space is not large, and the sitting is urgent.

Juju signature fried chicken
Frying chicken with spices, crispy on the outside, salty marinade, light flavor.

片 Spanish bad guy potato chips
The menu is said to be crispy potato chips, but in fact it tastes soft potato thick slices. The source of the taste is mainly salty sausage meat.

辣 signature garlic flavor pepper shrimp
Must order!Simple olive oil+garlic+pepper, it tastes sweet and spicy, very charming, this method should be superb with the spasm; although the shrimp part tastes good, it may be covered by the tongue by the oil and the spicy stimulation of garlic is stimulated by garlic spicy. , So I ca n’t eat the sweetness of shrimp.

🔸 Seafood stewed rice
The seafood is very delicious, but I do n’t know why the taste is slightly powder, and the seasoning is a bit salty, and the umami tastes light.

🔸 Dorihazi
The fried bread taste is similar to the pudding bread, the inside is humid, and it tastes soft. The outer layer has cinnamon powder that does not love, but the overall cinnamon taste is not heavy. It is not bad with vanilla ice cream.

芋 Chef's secret recipe taro cheese cake
The taste is soft and smooth with a little Q, with thin taro fiber coarseness.

Salad flavor is very balanced.

小吃盤很好
蒜蓉蝦 - 味道不錯，但麵包很難咬
我們點了一罐桑格利亞汽酒，這可能是我們喝過的最糟糕的桑格利亞汽酒。它很苦，沒有太多水果味……太糟糕了。

我聽說過 Pablo 的快閃店很棒的事情，所以我必須去看看他的盛大開幕。一切都很棒，我不敢相信我在嘗試每個菜單項目中的一口大小後就吃得這麼飽了。

首先，桑格利亞汽酒可能是我在台灣喝過的最好的桑格利亞汽酒。它不太甜，真正注重水果的味道。這款酒混合得非常好，喝起來很舒服。後來我用牙籤把所有的水果塊都吃掉了。

小吃中最喜歡的菜可能是炸雞。我知道，炸雞聽起來很簡單，但它非常多汁，而且有很多味道。

我真的很喜歡每道菜中加入的醬汁，它很好地襯託了食物，並為食物增添了風味。

最後，我們以芋頭起司蛋糕結束，這是我吃過的最獨特的起司蛋糕。我喜歡它，因為它不太甜，而且你可以真正品嚐到芋頭和起司蛋糕的味道。吃得根本停不下來，口感也很棒。

恭喜開業！","Come here to participate in the grand opening ceremony, I have to say that all the snacks are delicious!

I heard that Pablo's pop -up shop is great, so I have to go to see his grand opening.Everything is great. I can't believe that I am so full after trying a bite in each menu item.

The favorite dish in snacks may be fried chicken.I know that fried chicken sounds simple, but it is very juicy and has a lot of taste.

I really like the sauce added to each dish. It sets off the food well and adds flavor to the food.

Finally, we ended with taro cheese cakes, which is the most unique cheese cake I have ever eaten.I like it because it is not too sweet, and you can really taste the taste of taro and cheese cakes.I ca n’t stop eating at all, and the taste is great.

"雖然很不情願，但我還是給了這個地方三顆星，原因在我的評論中進一步說明。

鑑於谷歌地圖上有很多好評，我對這次訪問抱有很高的期望。

JuJu的超級拼盤值得四顆星，因為伊比利亞冷盤、塞拉諾火腿和曼切戈起司都很美味。 “自製”的肉醬很不錯。  另一方面，麵包很普通，看起來與選單照片中顯示的完全不同。

大蒜蝦也高於平均水平，因為蝦子很嫩，大蒜味的橄欖油是補充和開胃的。

那天晚上提供的湯和其他菜餚並不是特別令人難忘。西班牙海鮮飯低於標準，因為蝦子很乾，米飯沒有味道。

我的訪問有幾個方面削弱了我對這個地方的熱情。

首先，狹小的空間擠滿了太多的桌子。因此，坐在相鄰桌子上的食客幾乎都在觸手可及的距離之內。在最好的時候，這並不是一個令人愉快的用餐環境，更不用說在大流行期間了。

其次，整個晚上只有兩位服務生為整個餐廳的三十多名顧客提供服務。這兩個可憐的人太忙了，無法提供良好的服務，儘管他們盡力了。坐下來等了三十分鐘後我們只好要水。整個晚上，服務生沒有一次過來詢問我們是否需要什麼。

最後但並非最不重要的一點是，炸雞訂單從未送達，但費用卻出現在帳單上。只是因為我妻子注意到收費過高，所以才得到糾正。

因此，我對這次訪問的感受很複雜。我不確定我是否有足夠的動力回去。","Although I was reluctant, I gave three stars in this place because of further explanation in my comments.

Given that there are a lot of praise on Google Maps, I have high expectations for this interview.

JUJU's super platter is worth four stars, because Iberian cold disks, Serano ham and Manticige are all delicious.The ""self -made"" meat sauce is very good.On the other hand, the bread is very ordinary, and it looks completely different from the display photos.

Garlic shrimp is also higher than the average level, because the shrimp is very tender, and the garlic -flavored olive oil is supplemented and appetizing.

The soup and other dishes provided that night were not particularly memorable.Spanish seafood rice is lower than the standard because the shrimp is very dry and the rice has no taste.

Several aspects of my visit weakened my enthusiasm for this place.

First of all, the small space is crowded with too many tables.Therefore, almost all diners sitting on the adjacent table are within the distance.At the best time, this is not a pleasant dining environment, let alone during the period.

Secondly, only two waiters provide services to more than 30 customers in the entire restaurant throughout the night.These two poor people are too busy to provide good services, although they do their best.After sitting down and waiting for thirty minutes, we had to have water.Throughout the night, the waiter did not come over to ask if we need.

In the end, it is not the most unimportant point that fried chicken orders have never been delivered, but the cost appears on the bill.It was only because my wife noticed that the charge was too high, so I was corrected.
