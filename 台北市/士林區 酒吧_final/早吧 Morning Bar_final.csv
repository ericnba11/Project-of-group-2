"大學時期住在士林
會和朋友約的早午餐店

這家位於美崙街上
還算好停車
常常吃飽會在附近逛個市場
或是三五好友在裡面聊天
悠閒吃早餐

這次返台
必須來嚐一下大學回憶
價格也是可以接受的
店內醬料幾乎都是自製的
很特別又能讓人吃得安心

很喜歡他們家的蛋餅
是脆皮口感
外皮酥脆、內餡多
選擇的口味也很多
（也有古早味蛋餅）
個人喜歡脆口感的

手工泡菜豬肉堡
選用蕎麥麵包皮
吃起來更健康
配上微辣泡菜清脆解膩
吃一個可以直接當早午餐
厚厚大口咬下很滿足

這次很愛的是大阪燒蘿蔔糕
能在一早吃到大阪燒太幸福了
蘿蔔糕煎的脆脆的
上面鋪滿柴魚！
芥末醬也是店家自製
不會嗆辣的那種
小孩也能吃～
整份吃完很有飽足感

藍莓乳酪厚片
藍莓醬是店家自製的
很清爽不膩好涮嘴
點個兩片都不嫌多！
莓果控的我很愛
厚片很鬆軟
兩者搭配超讚

他們家的鮮奶茶
是用烏龍茶和鮮奶調製
別於一般早餐店奶茶

3、起司乳酪蛋餅（餡料就起司乳酪、沙拉醬）一開始吃覺得不錯，但一直覺得蛋餅內餡濕濕又甜甜，一直咬到最後一口沙拉醬掉出一坨😒，才知道原來是因為沙拉醬。  這道如果可以不要沙拉醬會比較好，因為吃的最後很膩。
4、蘿蔔糕就一般，建議外皮煎酥脆硬一點
5、瓶罐標示自製蒜蓉醬油膏，吃不到蒜蓉味反而很甜！
6、辣椒醬還行，不辣可當沾醬用了
7、鮮奶茶不錯不會太甜
