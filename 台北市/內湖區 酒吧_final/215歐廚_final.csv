"很可惜沒拍到每道餐點，我是首次來用餐，整體感受令我驚艷，首先是典雅昏黃的裝潢與燈光，非常高級有質感，超適合網美（怎麼拍怎麼美）再來是服務（我來的時間沒什麼客人，可能也因爲這樣服務人員有更多展現貼心服務的機會），因為這天我跟媽媽是用餐卷消費，而服務人員也沒有因此怠慢，語調親切、積極，態度從容、動作輕柔，甚至晚餐時段服務人員還會親自演奏（不是隨隨便便的演奏，是認真的表演），再來最重要的餐點，因為是使用餐券所以餐點數量不多，我能給予評價的項目也就這幾道
起司芋粿什麼的（魚腦記不了菜名）：鹹味的起司濃、醇、香（不是林鳳營），搭配超Q芋粿，真的好好吃（魂牽夢縈）。
卡布奇諾箘菇什麼湯的（記性到底多差）：是用espresso 的杯子盛裝，沒有太多影響味蕾的人工調味料，吃得到箘菇天然香氣。
手作麵包：奶油抹醬香氣四溢不膩口，搭配剛烤出來的鬆軟麵包真是絕配
焗烤海鮮南瓜筆尖麵：南瓜是比較緊實的口感（我個人愛鬆軟的），整體醬料濃郁但沒有過重的奶香味，因為前幾道料理都有奶油或起司，本來還有點擔心這道會太膩而吃不下，但顯然是我多慮了，主廚把奶味降到最低而不失存在感，襯托著其他海鮮、蔬菜食材，讓人在吃了幾道前菜後仍能輕鬆吃完主菜。

Cheese taro or something (the name of the fish brain can not be recorded): the salty cheese is thick, alcohol, and incense (not Lin Fengying). With the ultra -Q taro, it is really delicious (the soul and dream).

Hand -made bread: The aroma of the cream is not greasy, and the soft bread just baked is really perfect
Baked grilled seafood pumpkin pen tip: Pumpkin is a relatively tight taste (I personally love to be soft). The overall sauce is strong but not overweight, because the first few dishes have cream or cheese. This can be too greasy and I ca n’t eat it, but obviously I am more worrying. The chef has lowered the milk taste to the lowest without losing the sense of existence. It sets off other seafood and vegetable ingredients. Eat the main cuisine easily.

座位間距大算舒適，環境整體高級，但也有些不太搭配的擺設裝潢略顯突兀。

I did not ask if I was drinking water or bubble water. It was mentioned by ourselves.
The quality of education and training in service staff is low, and the content of the meal is not too familiar.
The display of meat and cheese is also like throwing it at will
Poor texture
In addition, the soup and the main meal are better than the previous dish
That is to say it has nothing to do
However, the price is really high in the high -end restaurant
You shouldn't make such a mistake

Kitchen staff keep standing next to chatting
The atmosphere of the restaurant is ordinary but the service staff is busy
The meal part is acceptable, but the atmosphere of the restaurant is low in service quality, and only the music has added some points

這電話由樓館來打，確實讓我覺得他們處理客訴算是細心，因為怕由餐廳的店長打來，可能語氣不好的話，會讓客人覺得又被冒犯（可能因為禮客負責人跟餐廳負責人為同一個，所以他們用這樣的方式處理）
電話最後，樓館提出了補償方式，然後店長也接過電話來與我致歉，態度都是很好的。
餐廳還有很大的進步空間，加油！

——————————
這是第2次來到此餐廳用餐，其實第一次用餐的感覺已經不是挺好的了，原因是：
第一：
飲用水的部分！這個餐廳想要營造出高級餐廳的感覺，所以提供了付費的瓶裝礦泉水和氣泡水，但對於想喝溫開水的客人，卻告知沒有，後來又有端出來，但話語中有點感覺好像是被施捨一樣，感覺真的不是很舒服！
我想說的是，這裏是台灣，不是歐洲，飲水習慣並不同，極大多數的台灣人並不習慣喝瓶裝礦泉水以及氣泡水，這種逼人購買的收費，讓人留下很不好的印象！
第二：
餐具不乾淨，這真的很糟糕，餐具擺放的時候竟然沒有確認是乾淨的，等到客人入座看到了告知之後才更換，這是另一個扣分的地方！

而這一次，因為希望在過年前請爸爸媽媽吃一頓餐，特別電話訂位，沒想到一入座，又看到盤子裡面整個髒，只好請服務生換一個，這真的真的很扣分。
接著，又問到付費飲用水的部分，我們全家不喝礦泉水也不喝氣泡水，再加上天氣冷，所以告知需要溫開水(離上次吃飯有點時間了，所以也忘了沒有提供溫開水，所以還是告知需要溫開水)，沒想到，這一次有提供，讓我覺得這樣有加分到，但喝完一杯後再次詢問溫開水，卻被告知要收費，這真的感覺極差無比！雖然只是小錢，但付的很不舒服、當然也非常不甘願！

然後餐點的部分，其中一道海鮮燉飯的龍蝦，肉質非常差，整個龍蝦肉粉粉軟軟爛爛的，很明顯就是死掉好一陣子，且吃起來有海鮮臭掉的味道，告知服務生跟廚師詢問，得到的答案是：這是正常的，可能每隻龍蝦不一樣。（廚師沒有出來說明，是服務生來說的。對於一個餐廳來說，如果餐點有什麼比較嚴重的問題，大部分廚師會出來說明狀況，但這間餐廳沒有...）
然後吃完回來後，我拉肚子了......這樣這餐廳真的還要堅持：這是正常的嗎？
而且第一次來吃這一道菜時，龍蝦並沒有這個問題，肉質雖不像新鮮的那樣很Q彈但還算是紮實的。這一次卻如此糟糕...
最後，服務生來說不好意思，感覺我們用餐不是很愉快(沒錯，非常不愉快！)所以問我們要不要喝飲料，可都吃到最後了，大家也很飽，所以我們婉拒了；他們又再詢問還是再給甜點？我們也說不用了。(後來是有再多拿甜點上來，老實說，甜點不錯！)

然後對於這次收取服務費，也讓我事後想想覺得很不爽！如果人手不足忙不過來，可以在我訂位的時候先告知，這樣我可以選擇不要去吃！被晾在一邊的感覺真的很不好。我是預約來用餐的，不是來餓肚子，也不是來一直提醒你，請問餐點什麼時候上？
因為同段看起來還有包廂客人，所以對於我們這桌的服務不太有照顧到，像是想點餐可能服務生要叫2、3次才來，點餐完，前菜的沙拉遲遲沒上，都快餓到發慌了，詢問之下才看到沙拉放在出餐台好一陣子了...

以上總總讓我決定不會再來這家餐廳了！
我很少很少給這樣的評價，幾乎是沒有。第一次用餐後對於飲用水的部分口頭給的建議，看起來店家並沒有放在心上。這真的很扣分！
再來餐具的清潔，2次用餐都讓我們遇到髒的。
最後，既然要收服務費，就請好好注意客人有什麼需要服務，站在那邊背對客人，這樣客人要舉手舉多久才會被注意到呢？也請注意餐點是否在出餐台了嗎？熱菜放涼了，對客人對廚師都是不禮貌的！

（只能說對餐廳很失望，所以第一次給評價我沒有照片可以提供....哎）","Update: I did not expect to receive an apology call from the gift building room yesterday. The words were very polite and patiently listened to my narrative situation, and informed that the freshness of the meal would be punished.But letting the restaurant be punished is not my original intention. When I heard this, I felt embarrassed.
This call is called by the building, which really makes me feel that they are careful about the handling of the guest complaint, because if they are afraid of being beaten by the restaurant's manager, it may make the guests feel that they will be offended (maybe because of the person in charge of the courtesy and follow The person in charge of the restaurant is the same, so they handle it in this way)
At the end of the phone, the building pavilion proposed a compensation method, and then the manager also took the phone to apologize to me, and his attitude was very good.
There is still a lot of room for progress in the restaurant, come on!

———————————————
This is the second time I came to this restaurant for dining. In fact, the first time I felt that it was not very good. The reason was:
First:
Drinking water!This restaurant wants to create a high -end restaurant, so it provides paid bottled mineral water and bubble water, but for customers who want to drink warm water, they notified no, but later they came out, but the words seemed to be a bit of being being quilt. Like Shishi, it is really not very comfortable!
What I want to say is that this is Taiwan, not Europe, and the habit of drinking water is different. Most Taiwanese are not used to drinking bottled mineral water and bubble water. Impression!
second:
The tableware is not clean. This is really bad. When the tableware was placed, it was not confirmed that it was clean. It was not until the guests saw the notification and changed. This is another place to deduct!

And this time, I hope to ask my parents to have a meal before the New Year. I booked a special call. I did not expect to enter the seat. I saw the whole dirt in the plate, so I had to ask the waiter to change it. Essence
Then, when I asked the part of the paid drinking water, our family did not drink mineral water or soaked in water, and the weather was cold, so I informed that the warm water was needed (it was a bit of time to eat last time, so we forgot that I did not provide warmth. Open water, so I still told the warm water). I did not expect that this time it provided it, which made me feel that there was an additional score, but after drinking a drink, I asked the warm water again, but was told that it would be charged. IntersectionAlthough it is only small money, it is very uncomfortable and of course very unwilling!

Then the meal part, one of the seafood stewed lobster, the meat is very poor, the entire lobster pink powder is soft and rotten, it is obvious that it is dead for a while, and it tastes the smell of seafood stinking, inform the waiter Ask the chef that the answer is: this is normal, maybe each lobster is different.(The chef did not come out to explain, it was the waiter. For a restaurant, if there is any serious problem with meals, most chefs will come out to explain the situation, but this restaurant is not ...)
Then after eating, I diarrhea ... So this restaurant really insists: Is this normal?
And when I came to eat this dish for the first time, the lobster did not have this problem. Although the meat was not as fresh as fresh, it was still solid.This time it was so bad ...
In the end, the waiter is embarrassed, I feel that we are not very happy to eat (yes, very unpleasant!) So ask us if we want to drink drinks, but we have eaten at the end, so we are full, so we declined Ask or give a dessert again?We also said no need.(Later, I got more desserts, and honestly, the dessert is good!)

Then the service fee for this time also made me feel uncomfortable afterwards!If the person is not busy, you can tell you first when I order, so that I can choose not to eat it!It feels really bad to be dry on the side.I made an appointment to dine, not to be hungry, nor to remind you all the time, when will the meals go?
Because there are still boxers in the same paragraph, the service of our table is not very taken care of. It seems that if you want to order food, you may be called 2 or 3 times. I was so hungry that I was so panicked. I saw the salad on the dining table for a while after the question ...

The above always let me decide not to come to this restaurant again!
I rarely give such evaluations, almost no.After the first meal, the proposal given to some verbal drinking water seems that the store has not been attentive.This is really deducted!
Come to the cleaning of the tableware, and the two meals have made us dirty.
In the end, since the service fee is to be charged, please pay attention to what the guests need to serve, stand there and face the guests, so how long will the guests raise their hands to be noticed?Please also pay attention to whether the meal is on the dining table?The hot vegetables are cooling, and the guests are impolite to the chefs!
